1196,2794,10,30,2017,2017-10-30,Breitbart,"Manafort Lawyer Backs Up White House, Calls Charges ‘Novel,’ ‘Ridiculous’","Paul Manafort, the one-time chair of the Trump campaign, and Richard Gates, a business partner also involved in the campaign, pleaded not guilty to all charges on their joint indictment Monday. The pair were released on house arrest.  One of Manafort’s defense attorneys, Kevin Downing, was defiant as he spoke to the press about what he characterized as “novel.”  “I think you all saw today that President Donald Trump was correct. There is no evidence that Mr. Manafort or the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government,” he told the throng of reporters waiting outside Prettyman United States Courthouse in Washington, DC, echoing similar claims by the White House on news of the indictment.  All charges against both Manafort and Gates are entirely unrelated to their work with the Trump campaign and stem from alleged misconduct when Manafort served as a consultant for Ukranian President Viktor Yanukovych before that democratically elected pro-Russian leader’s demise in 2014 “Euromaidan Revolution.”  Despite his general warmth with President Vladimir Putin’s Russia and support base among Ukraine’s Russian-speaking minority, Yanukovich also made overtures to the European Union over Ukraine’s future. Downing characterized Manafort’s work as follows:  Mr. Manafort represented pro-European Union campaigns for the Ukrainians. And in that he was seeking to further democracy and to help the Ukraine come closer to the United States and the EU. Those activities ended in 2014, over two years before Mr. Manafort served in the Trump campaign.  Manafort and Gates stand accused of a bevy of financial crimes stemming from their alleged hiding of receipts from this business in overseas accounts and violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). The two men allegedly failed to register as foreign agents and then made misleading and inaccurate filings in 2016 and 2017 when they finally did.  Downing took issue with the FARA charges, finding them unusual. “Today you see an indictment brought by an Office of the Special Counsel that is using a very novel theory to prosecute Mr. Manafort, regarding a FARA filing,” he said, “the United States government has only used that offense six times since 1966 and only resulted in one conviction.”  Manafort’s lawyer was just as critical of the money laundering allegations. “The second thing about this indictment that I myself find most ridiculous is the claim that maintaining offshore accounts to bring all your funds into the United States is a scheme to conceal,” he said.  Beyond a bare-bones acknowledgement of the indictment itself, lawyers at Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office have not publicly spoken further about the case.  Downing refused to answer any questions from the press, including shouted queries of “Did [Tony] Podesta get immunity?”  Tony Podesta, powerful Washington lobbyist and brother to John Podesta, chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign, also did work for Yanukovich and his “Party of Regions.” He resigned from his Podesta Group lobbying firm Monday just as Manafort and Gates were being arraigned. The firm is reportedly under investigation by Special Counsel Mueller over FARA violations which may, just as in Manafort’s case, be related to Ukraine and Yanukovych.",2.772727272727273,11,"[3.5, 0.5, 1.5, 4.5, 5.0, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 2.0, 0.5, 3.5]"
587,1983,10,13,2017,2017-10-13,Vox,Leaked memos show Jeff Sessions's DOJ aims to undermine due process for immigrants,"The Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, as broad and thorough as it’s been, has run time and again into one big obstacle: laws that guarantee due process to many immigrants apprehended without papers, whether they’re asylum seekers caught at the US border or immigrants living in the US caught by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).  But Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the Department of Justice have the immigration court system surrounded. And now, like an anaconda, they’re beginning to squeeze.  As part of a broader attack on what it calls the “abuse” of asylum by children and families arriving from Central America, the administration is considering — according to a September memo obtained by CNN’s Tal Kopan — allowing judges to strip people who come to the US as “unaccompanied children” of the legal protections that status provides if they turn 18 while they’re still in immigration proceedings, or if they’re reunited with a parent in the US.  Meanwhile, a report from the Washington Post’s Maria Sacchetti indicates that the Department of Justice wants to start rating immigration judges based on how many cases they resolve — which would put pressure on them to resolve cases more quickly and show less leniency toward immigrants.  These moves aren’t about making more people eligible for deportation. They’re about making fewer people eligible for a full legal process before getting deported. The Trump administration, and the Department of Justice in particular, is renewing its efforts to deter people from coming to the US without papers — even to seek humanitarian protection, as US and international law allows them to do — by making that protection as difficult as possible to get.  The Trump administration is trying to close what it sees as a back door into the US — and its critics see as simple due process  Here’s the problem the Trump administration is trying to address: A large portion of the people who are currently coming to the US without papers are coming as children, or parents with children, from Central America (specifically Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador). They’re seeking humanitarian protection from gang violence in their home countries. And Border Patrol agents, under both US and international law, are obligated to allow them to seek it rather than simply turning them away.  To the Trump administration, though, this isn’t an example of border security working — it’s a loophole being exploited by people who just want to sneak into the US. Attorney General Sessions (who gave a speech to immigration judges on Thursday about the “crisis” of asylum abuse) and other administration officials say that too many people are being allowed to stay in the US on the basis of “credible fear” of persecution, and that once they’re released from custody, they are caught up in a years-long, backlogged immigration court process — or simply disappear into American communities rather than showing up for their court dates.  They’re partly right. A majority of people pass their “credible fear” screenings, though that number is dropping as the Trump administration has started to raise alarms with employees about asylum abuse: The approval rate for “credible fear” was 81 percent in October and only 68 percent in June. (Sessions and other Trump officials, unsurprisingly, routinely claim that 89 percent of credible fear applications are being approved — which was true in 2014 but isn’t anymore — to make the problem seem dire.)  The immigration court backlog is, in fact, the biggest obstacle to large-scale deportations — both of asylum seekers and of unauthorized immigrants living in the US arrested by ICE agents. Many immigrants don’t ultimately prevail in immigration court, but the time it takes for them to build their cases (and the fact that immigration courts are understaffed) means that it usually takes months or years for a judge to reach that conclusion.  And many people do miss their court hearings once they’ve settled in the US, though it’s not clear how many of them were lying about their asylum claims; how many simply didn’t know when their court date was; and how many figured out that the judge was unlikely to approve their asylum claims, regardless of whether they were telling the truth.  But the Trump administration can’t simply start turning people away or detaining them en masse. There are laws governing how they have to treat asylum seekers — and how they have to treat families. And people who come to the US as unaccompanied children are given certain legal protections under a 2008 anti-trafficking law — which, among other things, prevents the government from deporting them without a court hearing or deporting them to a third country.  That gives the Trump administration two options: to try to limit the reach of those laws so that fewer people are guaranteed a full judicial process; or to try to make sure that as often as possible, that process ends with immigrants being denied protection.  It’s working on both.  Sessions’s DOJ wants to make it easier for immigrants who come as children to lose protections months or years after they arrive  The new memo, written by the general counsel of the Executive Office of Immigration Review (which oversees immigration judges), is trying to do everything possible under the executive branch’s power to change the anti-trafficking law.  It recommends that the label of “unaccompanied child” — and the protections that come with it — should be stripped by an immigration judge if the immigrant is no longer a minor, or if he’s no longer unaccompanied. (Right now, the label of “unaccompanied child” is basically assigned when an immigrant arrives in the US and is not reviewed by the judge assigned to process the case.)  The first category could hurt people who arrived in the US in their late or even mid-teens — given the lengthy immigration court backlog, it’s possible that it would take a few years for an immigrant to get final approval for humanitarian protections, and that a 15-year-old could simply be stalled in court until turning 18 and becoming imminently deportable.  The second category would hurt children who came to meet parents living in the US (whether those parents are legal immigrants or not). The Trump administration has already started targeting unauthorized immigrants whose children arrive unaccompanied; ICE has targeted them in nationwide raids. Now, it’s sending the message to parents that they are putting not only themselves at risk if they send for their children, but the children as well.  The administration may try to pressure immigration judges to resolve cases quickly  Sessions’s DOJ appears to be moving to pressure immigration judges to move through cases more quickly with this new rating system, as reported by the Post. That would incentivize judges to do things, like stripping “unaccompanied child” protections, that would allow them to close a case more quickly. And it would more generally be a problem for immigrants trying to pull together evidence to make the strongest possible asylum case.  According to the Post, the DOJ has written in internal memos that it “intends to implement numeric performance standards to evaluate [immigration] Judge performance.” It’s not totally clear what those standards are. But given Sessions’s complaints about the length of the court backlog — and guidance sent from DOJ headquarters to judges in July, discouraging them from being too lenient in allowing immigrants to reschedule their hearings for a later date while evidence is being gathered — immigration judges themselves are worried that they’re going to be stuck with “production quotas” for the number of cases they resolve.  Doing this would require the government to change its current contract with the immigration judges union, which prohibits judges from being rated based on how many cases they resolve or how quickly they resolve them. But the judges union told the Post the government is trying to do just that.  Sessions doesn’t appear to be trying to control how judges resolve cases. But the more pressure judges are placed under to resolve cases quickly, the less likely they are to agree to give immigrants time to make the strongest case — and the more likely they are to take any opportunity to deny that an immigrant is entitled to a full hearing at all.  The Trump administration has flipped quickly from celebrating a border “victory” to declaring a “crisis”  Ultimately, the administration’s goal is to stop as many people as possible — including children and families — from even trying to settle in the United States to begin with.  Less than nine months since Trump’s inauguration, his government is already the victim of its own success on border security. Trump came to office claiming that the US-Mexico border was so insecure that it was barely a border at all (despite all evidence to the contrary). But when the number of people (especially Central American children and families) coming to the US plummeted in the first few months of 2017, Trump bragged that he’d fixed the problem simply by coming into office and talking tough, and now the border was secure.  He probably wasn’t wrong — evidence suggests that people really were deterred from coming to the US because they were worried about what Trump would do. But that didn’t last forever, because for children and families, there wasn’t much the Trump administration could do within the bounds of the law as it had been interpreted.  And now the number of Border Patrol apprehensions has started creeping back up. The Trump administration, in response, has flipped from celebrating its victory on border security to treating it as a “crisis” that requires immediate congressional help, and that justifies including all sorts of enforcement measures in Congress’s deal to address the fate of immigrants with DACA.  The problem with the Trump administration judging its success on how few people even come to the US, though, is that it’s not really in the US’s control.  The only thing they can do is punish as many of the people who do arrive as possible, and hope that they spread the word that coming to the US doesn’t work.  It’s going to be hard to execute that kind of crackdown without outright violating the laws that guarantee due process in the name of humanitarian protection. So, apparently, the Trump administration is trying to chip away at due process from the inside, and hoping that might be enough.",3.2777777777777777,9,"[5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0]"

Bergdorf, who was previously given a platform by the BBC when cosmetics firm L’Oreal sacked them for similar racist comments, was speaking on the October 12th edition of the BBC This Week current affairs programme.  “What kind of country is modern Britain? No doubt it’s a country that likes to think of itself as inclusive, but that depends on where you’re standing,” Bergdorf complained.  “For me, as a transgender mixed race person, we live in a deeply racist society.”  ""The uncomfortable truth is that the white race is the most violent and oppressive force of nature on earth"" @MunroeBergdorf in #bbctw film pic.twitter.com/TePO0S1RhX — BBC This Week (@bbcthisweek) October 12, 2017  “Why should we expect anything else from a country that’s built its success on the enslavement of non-white people?” Bergdorf alleged.  “It’s that continuous cycle of racism that explains where we are now. Why does the UK acknowledge the sacrifice of people killed in wars, but not the spilt blood of black people?”  In fact, there are many British memorials commemorating the victims of the slave trade and celebrating its abolition. The oldest, according to Historic England, is the Anti-Slavery Arch in Stroud, Gloucestershire, erected in 1834 by Henry Wyatt to celebrate the passing of the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833.  The most recent appears to have been a memorial erected in June this year to commemorate Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, a parliamentarian who campaigned tirelessly against slavery.  The British probably did more to end the institution of slavery than any other people, following the abolition of the trade at home in 1807 with a sustained, worldwide campaign against the practice.  Arab Muslim slavers in North Africa, who had enslaved white Europeans and black Africans for centuries, were forced to curb their practices after the intervention of the Royal Navy, and British Christian missionaries like Dr. David Livingstone and Dr. John Kirk worked tirelessly to put an end to the related East African slave trade.  TV doc on murder of white schoolboy by racist Pakistanis airs day after ""all whites benefit from racism"" rant on BBC https://t.co/p93ZCNfPz2 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 10, 2017  Bergdorf continued by making the disturbing claim that racism is somehow written into white people’s DNA, telling them they “need to understand that racism is not learned, it’s inherited, and either consciously or unconsciously passed down through privilege” — much like the Abrahamic concept of Original Sin.  “The uncomfortable truth is that the white race is the most violent and oppressive force of nature on earth,” the model concluded.  The police arrest hundreds of people for similar comments about non-white people every year, and encourage the public to report them through its online hate crime portal. The fact that Bergdorf’s comments have been aired by a publicly-funded broadcaster without apparent sanction has resulted in many accusations of double standards on social media.

Original story below:  Just hours after actress Rose McGowan launched a broadside against Amazon CEO (and Washington Post owner) Jeff Bezos with the accusation that the richest man in the world was “funding rapists, alleged pedos, and sexual harassers,” one of Bezos’s top executives, Roy Price, was publicly accused of harassing television producer Isa Hackett.  In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Hackett says the horror show began in a cab after an Amazon staff party back in July of 2015:  Once in the cab, Hackett says Price repeatedly and insistently propositioned her. “You will love my d**k,” he said, according to Hackett, who relayed her account to multiple individuals in the hours after the alleged episode. (The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed Hackett told at least two people about the alleged incident in the immediate aftermath.) Hackett says she made clear to Price she was not interested and told him that she is lesbian with a wife and children. Hackett says Price did not relent in the cab or once they arrived at the Amazon party. As she talked with other executives, she says that Price stepped close to her and loudly said, “Anal sex!” in her ear.  Most damning for Amazon is the fact that Hatckett reported the incidents to Amazon. The company says it did an investigation but Price still has his high-powered job.

President Donald Trump is expected to announce this week that he will end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, but with a six-month delay, according to two people familiar with the decision-making. (AP Photo/Richard Vogel)  WASHINGTON (AP) — A plan President Donald Trump is expected to announce Tuesday for young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children was embraced by some top Republicans on Monday and denounced by others as the beginning of a “civil war” within the party.  The response was an immediate illustration of the potential battles ahead if Trump follows through with a plan that would hand a political hot potato to Republicans on the Hill who have a long history of dropping it.  Two people familiar with his decision making said Sunday that Trump was preparing to announce an end to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA program, but with a six-month delay intended to give Congress time to pass legislation that would address the status of the hundreds of thousands of immigrants covered by the program.  The move comes after a long and notably public deliberation. Despite campaigning as an immigration hard-liner, Trump has said he is sympathetic to the plight of the immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally as children and in some cases have no memories of the countries they were born in.  But such an approach — essentially kicking the can down the road and letting Congress deal with it— is fraught with uncertainty and political perils that amount, according to one vocal opponent, to “Republican suicide.”  Still other Republicans say they are ready to take on a topic that has proven a non-starter and career-breaker for decades.  “If President Trump makes this decision we will work to find a legislative solution to their dilemma,” said Republican Sen. Lindsay Graham.  Officials caution Trump’s plan, set to be unveiled Tuesday, is not yet finalized, and the president, who has been grappling with the issue for months, has been known to change his mind at the last minute ahead of an announcement. It also remains unclear exactly how a six-month delay would work in practice, including whether the government would continue to process applications under the program, which has given nearly 800,000 young immigrants a reprieve from deportation and the ability to work legally in the country in the form of two-year, renewable permits.  House Speaker Paul Ryan and a handful of other Republicans urged Trump last week to hold off on scrapping DACA to give lawmakers time to come up with a legislative fix.  But Congress has repeatedly tried — and failed — to come together on immigration overhaul legislation, and it remains uncertain whether the House would succeed in passing anything on the divisive topic.  The House under Democratic control passed a Dream Act in 2010, but it died in the Senate. Since Republicans retook control of the House in late 2010, it has taken an increasingly hard line on immigration. House Republicans refused to act on the Senate’s comprehensive immigration bill in 2013. Two years later, a GOP border security bill languished because of objections from conservatives.  Many House Republicans represent highly conservative districts, and if the president goes through with the six-month delay — creating a March deadline — the pressure is likely to be amplified as primary races intensify head of the 2018 midterm elections.  One cautionary tale: the primary upset of former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor to a conservative challenger in 2014 in a campaign that cast him as soft on illegal immigration. That loss convinced many House Republicans that pro-immigrant stances could cost them politically.  The Obama administration created the DACA program in 2012 as a stopgap as they pushed unsuccessfully for a broader immigration overhaul in Congress. Many Republicans say they opposed the program on the grounds that it was executive overreach.  Legislation to legalize the so-called Dreamers has been lingering in Congress for years, with a handful of bills currently pending in the House and Senate.  The one that has received the most attention, introduced by Sens. Graham, R-S.C., and Dick Durbin, D-Ill., would grant permanent legal status to more than 1 million young people who arrived in the United States before they turned 18, passed security checks and met other criteria, including enrolling in college, joining the military or finding jobs.  It’s unclear, however, whether the president would throw his support behind that or any other existing legislation. He could encourage the writing of a new bill — tied, perhaps, to funding for his promised border wall or other concessions like a reduction in legal immigration levels. But it’s unclear how much political capital the president would want to put on the line given his base’s strong opposition to illegal immigration, his campaign rhetoric blasting DACA as illegal “amnesty” and his reluctance to campaign hard for other priorities, like health care overhaul.  Graham said in a statement Monday that he would support the president if he decided ultimately to go through with the plan as outlined.  “I have always believed DACA was a presidential overreach. However, I equally understand the plight of the Dream Act kids who -- for all practical purposes -- know no country other than America,” Graham said in a statement.  Sen. James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, agreed, saying that it should be up to Congress, not the White House, to set immigration policy.  “We must confront the nation’s out-of-date immigration policy and finally resolve the issues of strong border enforcement and merit immigration,” he said. “It is right for there to be consequences for those who intentionally entered this country illegally. However, we as Americans do not hold children legally accountable for the actions of their parents.”  But Rep. Steve King, an Iowa Republican who believes that DACA is unconstitutional, warned that pushing the decision to Congress would be a big mistake.  “That would cause a great big civil war among the Republicans,” he said last week. “We’ve got enough of never-Trumpers in Congress that are undermining the president’s agenda.”  “Ending DACA now gives chance 2 restore Rule of Law. Delaying so R Leadership can push Amnesty is Republican suicide,” he added on Twitter late Sunday night.  ___  Associated Press writers Catherine Lucey and Erica Werner contributed to this report.",3.5,1,[3.5]

After 91 years Seattle will elect its second female mayor next week. Voters will choose urban planner Moon or former U.S. attorney Durkan to lead this city dealing with the benefits and headaches of a booming economy for some more than others as e-commerce giant Amazon expands. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson)  SEATTLE (AP) — When political consultant Cathy Allen and others learned the top four vote-getters in Seattle’s mayoral primary race were women, she paused to think.  “When was the last time Seattle had a woman mayor?” she wondered. A few prominent women who ran unsuccessfully over the years sprang to mind, but not any who won. So Allen checked and discovered the last female mayor of the Pacific Northwest’s largest city was elected in 1926.  “We’re sitting here going, ‘This can’t be,’” she said. “This is our progressive city.”  After 91 years, Seattle is poised to elect its second female mayor next week. Voters will choose between urban planner Cary Moon or former U.S. attorney Jenny Durkan to lead this city dealing with the benefits and headaches of an economy booming for some more than others as e-commerce giant Amazon expands. There are the only two candidates on the ballot.  Just a few months ago, neither woman was even in the race. Former Mayor Ed Murray was expected to easily win re-election after pushing through increases to the city’s minimum wage and emerging as a vocal opponent of President Donald Trump, who was trounced by Seattle voters in 2016. But Murray dropped his bid in May following accusations of sexual abuse by multiple men. He resigned in September.  In the August primary, Durkan, Moon, community activist Nikkita Oliver and former state lawmaker Jessyn Farrell took the four top spots.  The shock many Seattleites felt when Hillary Clinton lost to Trump could have played a part in the strong showing by this year’s female mayoral candidates, Allen said. Two well-known male candidates - state Sen. Bob Hasegawa and former Mayor Mike McGinn - finished a distant fifth and sixth in the primary.  There’s been a realization that “women are not nearly as equal as we figured we were,” said Allen, who has helped train female candidates in dozens of countries working with the national Women’s Political Caucus and the State Department.  Moon said attending the Women’s March in January in Washington, D.C., inspired her to run.  “There’s been a massive shift,” Moon said. “A lot of women are feeling a responsibility to step up and offer a different kind of leadership in politics.”  As of July 2016, only 19 percent of U.S. cities had a woman as mayor, according to the U.S. Conference of Mayors. And just 6 percent of the country’s top paid CEOs last year were women, an analysis by executive data firm Equilar and The Associated Press found.  “Every job I’ve ever had I’ve faced barriers because I’m a woman,” Durkan said.  The race between Durkan and Moon has keyed on how the city will respond to changes largely brought by Amazon, which employs about 40,000 people in Seattle. Housing prices have skyrocketed amid constant complaints about traffic and worries that the poor and middle class are being priced out.  Durkan, backed by the city’s business and labor establishment, has touted her managerial experience as a prosecutor. Moon, meanwhile, who formerly managed her family’s manufacturing business, has stressed her 20 years of activism on transit, waterfront and other city issues. During the campaign, both said they have been treated differently based on gender.  Durkan, who says she’s the first openly gay person to become a U.S. attorney, said she no longer looks at social media comments because so many are sexist and homophobic.  “Any woman who’s had any job is aware that you’re always pulled between various narratives: Are you going to cry, or are you an ice princess?” she said.  Moon said she gets asked if she’s tough enough for the job.  “Leadership is not about knocking heads together. It’s about leading,” she said. “But yes, when it comes time to settle a dispute, of course I can do that. There’s nothing in my resume that presumes I couldn’t do that.”  Bertha Knight Landes was elected Seattle’s mayor 16 years after women won the right to vote in Washington and just six years after women won the right to vote nationally.

1499,3167,11,7,2017,2017-11-07,Breitbart,Corey Stewart: Virginia Governor Election Could ‘Set the Stage for Knocking Out Tim Kaine in 2018’,"Corey Stewart, Republican Senate candidate from Virginia in the 2018 midterm election, looked at the Virginia governor’s race on Tuesday morning’s edition of Breitbart News Daily with SiriusXM hosts Alex Marlow, Raheem Kassam, and Steve Bannon.  “About ten days ago, Gillespie was way down in the polls. All these polls had him down by at least eight points, or down by ten,” Stewart noted.  “As Ed campaigned and became more Trumpian, he has more embraced the Trump agenda, it looks a lot like the campaign that I ran against him, frankly – running on issues such as protection of historical monuments, cracking down on MS-13 and other illegal alien criminals, and starting to embrace a little bit of the president but not completely,” he said, referring to his race against Gillespie for the Republican gubernatorial nomination.  “As he’s done that, his poll numbers have come way up. The RealClearPolitics average has him down by a little bit more than three points, which is a dramatic improvement, but he does seem to have some momentum on his side at this point,” Stewart said.  Bannon asked why the Trump agenda was so important to the Commonwealth.  “It’s important to remember that Virginia, we did lose it in 2016, but not by much,” Stewart replied. “At the end of the campaign, the campaign made the decision to really kind of focus the resources – and probably rightly so – on Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio. But Virginia could have been won.”  “And so the indication this year, this is really the only competitive election in 2017, was what happened in 2016 – was that an aberration, was it a one-time thing? Or was it the beginning of a big movement that’s bigger than Trump himself, bigger than the presidency?” he asked. “That’s really what is at stake today here in Virginia.”  Bannon asked why immigration was such a hot issue in Virginia.  “I don’t think people realize just how much illegal immigration affects the states that are not on the border,” Stewart replied. “Virginia has had a problem with illegal immigration for at least a couple of decades. Ten years ago, I led the biggest crackdown on illegal immigration in the country in Prince William County, which is in northern Virginia, a Democratic stronghold. I’ve been governing that county for ten years, and I’ve been getting re-elected largely based upon that issue because people are upset with illegal aliens coming in here and committing crimes.”  “This transcends political boundaries. This transcends racial lines,” he argued. “People believe that if somebody is in the country illegally, and they commit a crime, they should be deported. In Virginia, you’ve got this MS-13 gang. Eigthy percent of the members are illegal aliens, and they’ve been committing heinous crimes not just in northern Virginia, but in the other major area of Virginia, the Tidewater area where Virginia Beach is. Just recently, up and down the 81 corridor and in rural parts of the state, MS-13 has really been gaining ground and committing murders and other heinous crimes across the western part of Virginia as well.”  Stewart charged that Democrats cannot answer tough questions about MS-13 and illegal alien crime because “they know that people are upset about it, and they’ve got the left wing of their base that they’re trying to placate, the Bernie Sanders wing.”  “They’re trying to have this balancing act, trying to figure out a way to placate the far left and try to keep your more moderate Democrats in line. It’s not going to work,” he predicted. “The way we know that is, this left-wing group called the Latino Victory Fund ran this ad which is the biggest gift to Ed Gillespie and the Republicans of Virginia, and it was probably the dumbest move by liberals in the past year. They ran this ad where you’ve got this white guy in a pickup truck flying the Gadsden flag, flying the ‘Don’t Tread on Me’ flag, trying to run down minority children.”  “If Gillespie didn’t have momentum behind him at the beginning of that ad, he certainly has it now, even though he’s kind of a boring candidate, to be truthful,” Stewart said. “This ad has really ginned up not just opposition to the Democrats by Republicans, but from working-class people across the state.”  “It’s important just to get out there and vote,” he stressed. “At this point, you can just go to the State Board of Elections website to figure out where to vote, if people don’t know.”  “Let me just finish with this, and that is that what happens in Virginia in 2017 – if we win this state, or even if we come close today, it does set the stage for knocking out Tim Kaine in 2018 during my race for the Senate,” Stewart said. “It’s so important not just for who is governor of Virginia, but who is going to be the next U.S. senator from Virginia.”  “The problem that Tim Kaine’s got, his son is a member of Antifa,” he added. “His son was arrested in Minneapolis for disguising himself, putting on a hood and everything else, and then trying to flee arrest. Tim Kaine, instead of saying, ‘Well, my son made a mistake,’ he, instead, said, ‘Well, I’m proud that my son was involved in politics.’ His son was attacking law-abiding Trump supporters in Minneapolis!”  “You’ve got Kaine who wants to be seen as somewhat of a non-partisan figure, but when he ran for vice president, all that came unraveled, and people see him for the far-left politician that he is,” Stewart declared.  “Democrats have this civil war. You’ve got this book that’s being published today by Donna Brazile, and let me say that in Virginia, this division between the Bernie Sanders wing and the Hillary Clinton/Kaine wing of the party, the establishment part of the Democratic Party – it’s all coming unraveled. The Democratic Party, if it loses today, there are going to be even more recriminations and infighting among Democrats,” he predicted.

1391,3000,11,4,2017,2017-11-04,Fox News,Protecting your bank account in the wake of data breaches,"The name “Equifax” now sends shivers down our spines. The company we trusted to handle our credit scores has become a pariah of the financial world since it allowed hackers to steal vital information from 145 million American adults.  I’m one of them. You probably are too. Click here to check if your personal data was exposed in the Equifax data breach.  How much information was stolen? Let’s start with the basics: Your name, Social Security number and birthdate. That alone is a treasure trove for identity thieves. But they also may have your address and driver’s license number. These people know where you live. They can find out almost anything about you. The list of nefarious things they can do is beyond comprehension.  An example? Click here to learn how the Equifax breach lets ID thieves have surgery on your dime.  Here’s my best advice: Assume the worst. The hackers have your information, and Equifax can’t do anything to protect you. Law enforcement is too overwhelmed to find the culprits, and you are completely exposed.  Here’s what to do next.  Establish two-factor authentication  If you work at a modern business or organization, you’re probably familiar with this process already. Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra verification step to the login process of your most critical accounts. When a website asks for your user name and password, you may also receive a text message or an email with a special code. This is a standard practice and is considered safe.  The idea is that even though hackers may have figured out your credentials, they won't be able to access your account without the special code. Cybercriminals would have to nab your physical cellphone, which is probably protected by a passcode, as well. Using this system makes the task much too complicated, especially when many hackers are located in other countries.  Who allows 2FA?  Several websites and email providers already offer 2FA to help protect accounts. The problem is that these sites and providers don’t seem to promote these extra security measures. It’s up to users to figure it out.  Use Amazon, Google or Facebook? How about Apple or Microsoft? All offer 2FA protection, but only if you take a few minutes to set it up. Click here for the steps you need to take now to lock down your accounts.  But what about banks? Incredibly, not all banks support two-factor authentication. Given recent events, I expect this to change. In the meantime, you’ll have to check and see if your online banking permits 2FA. If it does, sign up for it right away.  You can usually set up two-factor authentication either on your online banking account page or within the bank’s official app. Here are the links to some of the more popular banks or financial institutions' two-factor authentication setup pages:  ? Bank of America  ? Capital One  ? Discover  ? USAA  ? Wells Fargo  If your bank is not on the list, call or visit it.  Prevent identity theft  OK, you’ve done your best to secure your accounts and made it hard for hackers to break into your bank or email. But remember, the Equifax hack happened last spring. Cybercriminals have had plenty of time to steal your identity. So what can you do to keep them from finishing the job?  Try executing a “credit freeze,” more accurately known as a “security freeze.” The name may sound strange, almost like sabotaging your own finances, but it’s a common defensive maneuver. If you suspect someone is already pretending to be you, you can lock your credit reports so that no one can open a new account in your name.  How does this work? Lenders consult your credit score before they start a partnership with you. If lenders can’t check those scores, no new accounts can be established.  Click here to learn more about how to set up a security freeze.  The most important thing is not to wait. Hackers move quickly, and this is their fulltime job. If they can steal your identity and bank account, they will, and as expediently as possible. Equifax made one of the biggest blunders in banking history. Now it’s up to us to clean up the mess.

927,2428,10,23,2017,2017-10-23,Fox News,James Comey's 'secret' Twitter account revealed,"Former FBI Director James Comey’s 'secret' Twitter account has finally been revealed after months of rumors linking him to cryptic tweets from the @FormerBu account.  The account created a stir earlier this year when Gizmodo reported that it likely belonged to Comey. At the time the account used the handle @projectexile7. The account’s name has remained Reinhold Niebuhr.  TWITTER AIMS TO BOOST USER SAFETY, UPDATES ITS RULES  While the origins of the @FormerBu handle are unclear, Reinhold Niebuhr was an American theologian who died in 1971. Comey wrote a thesis on Niebuhr while a student at the College of William and Mary.  The account’s first tweet was sent out on March 30 – a meme of Will Ferrell saying “actually I’m not even mad – that’s amazing” and a link to the FBI jobs website.  A second tweet – a photo of the Hudson River, was sent out on Oct. 18. A photo of Little Round Top, Gettysburg, was tweeted the following day with the message “good place to think about leadership and values.”  A photo tweeted on Oct. 20 showed a figure in a cornfield accompanied by the message “Good to be back in Iowa.”  With speculation again mounting that Comey was behind the account, a photo of migrating birds was tweeted Sunday. “Watching migrating white pelicans in Iowa thinking about Niebuhr’s Serenity Prayer,” read the accompanying message.  Comey was finally unmasked on Monday when he tweeted an image of himself standing on any empty road, apparently in Iowa. “Goodbye Iowa. On the road home. Gotta get back to writing. Will try to tweet in useful ways,” he wrote.  Journalist Benjamin Wittes, a close friend of Comey’s who had long refused to confirm the identity of @FormerBu, admitted Monday that the account belongs to the former FBI chief.  “OK, in light of this latest tweet, I will confirm that @FormerBu is, in fact, James Comey himself,” he tweeted.  President Trump took a swing at Comey last week when he tweeted that the former FBI director “totally protected Hillary Clinton” in the private email case. Trump made the attack following the release of FBI documents that show Comey began drafting a statement on the Clinton email investigation months before interviewing key witnesses and Clinton herself.

Microsoft wrote all about its new outdoor meeting spaces in a recent blog post.  All of the treehouses, three in total, were put together by Pete Nelson of the TV show Treehouse Masters. Two treehouses are currently openand one, which is a sheltered lounge space, is set to open later this year. All are built onon Microsoft's 500-acre Washington campus and, best of all, they are open to all employees. It's all part of a new system of technology-enabled outdoor spaces connected to the buildings around the campus. This also allows employees to work in new and creative ways.  ""People said, given the opportunity, they would work more outside,"" said Bret Boulter, who was leading the project and works in Microsoft's real estate and facilities division.The first thing when you walk into the space is that everyone is really quiet. You stop talking and are just present. Its fascinating. People absorb the environment, and it changes the perception of their work and how they can do it.  This is all based on research that suggests more exposure to outdoor-settings increases one's work productivity, focus and creativity. So there are indeed some professional benefits to working in nature. A summary of some of these studies can be found on a page from the University of Washington.  The treehouses are more than 12 feet off the ground, and feature amenities like skylights, charred-wood walls, fireplace, at least one gas fireplace, wooden canopies, an outdoor network for Wi-Fi, as well as some hidden electrical outlets. Microsoft employees are even able to get something to eat at an outdoor extension of the indoor cafeteria.The buildings are built to last for at least 20 years, and are made to expand as the trees continue to grow.  Some companies have made the decision to create more green indoor spaces that function much like outdoor spaces. The treehouse spaces that Microsoft put together are truly unique.

568,1962,10,13,2017,2017-10-13,Breitbart,"Trump Keeps Iran Deal, Refuses to Certify Compliance to Congress","President Donald Trump will not re-certify to Congress Iranian compliance with the landmark nuclear deal signed in 2015 under President Barack Obama, but will keep the agreement itself in place.  Congress will be urged to pass new “trigger points” to hold the Iranians to account and the Treasury Department will be directed to place additional sanctions on the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a wing of the Iranian military accused of terrorist acts in support of the Iranian regime throughout the region.  “The President has come to the conclusion that he cannot certify … that the sanctions relief we provided [Iran] is proportionate to the benefit we are seeing,” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on a Thursday evening press conference call where he and National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster laid out the broad strokes of what a White House fact sheet referred to as “President Donald J. Trump‘s New Strategy on Iran.”  The plan, according to McMaster, was the product of “months of an inter-agency process.”  The administration will not certify to Congress Iran’s compliance with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), better known as the Iran nuclear deal, or that the sanctions relief given under the deal is providing proportionate benefits to the United States.  It is required to do so every 90 days under a law called the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (INARA), passed nearly unanimously by Congress in the furor that surrounded President Obama reaching the agreement with the Iranians largely without consulting the Republican-controlled Senate. Although there has been no showing that the Iranian government has violated the terms of the JCPOA, Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Hailey said last month that the president “has grounds to stand on” in refusing to certify compliance should he choose to do so.  Reporting Wednesday indicated the administration has suffered serious internal tension over whether to certify under INARA since July, when the pro-certification elements of President Trump’s national security team won out before the last certification deadline. Last week, Dr. Sebastian Gorka, the former White House advisor and Breitbart News national security editor, who was present at those negotiations, told Breitbart News, “I can tell you one thing: I was in the Oval the day it was recertified last. It was the president behind the Resolute Desk. It was Steve [Bannon] and myself on the side of the president. It was H.R. McMaster, Rex Tillerson, [Steven] Mnuchin who were saying we have to recertify.”  Gorka believed it was unlikely the president would approve of another round of IRANA certification, a prediction borne out in Tillerson’s pronouncements. On Wednesday, Center for Security Policy President Frank Gaffney told Breitbart News Daily that he considered decertification without withdrawal, the strategem on which the administration has now settled, to “be a bait-and-switch.”  Tillerson called the JCPOA, against which Trump ran extensively during his campaign for the presidency, was “only one piece of what concerns us in our relationship with Iran.”  “We don’t think that nuclear deal should define the entire policy. Quite frankly, in the past, it more or less has defined Iran policy,” he explained, citing the Iranian Shiite theocratic regime’s “destabilizing” support of Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, and “other terrorist activities.” The decision to not certify compliance has the effect of putting reform of the nuclear deal in the hands of Congress. Tillerson recommended against Congress either doing nothing – and leaving the current deal in place – or scraping the deal entirely. Instead, he suggested:  There is a third path the president is going to be suggesting Congress consider. … amend the INARA to put in place some very firm trigger points … that if Iran crosses any of these trigger points the sanctions automatically go back into place. There’s no determination other than they’ve hit a trigger point. There’s no other action required, the sanctions just automatically go back on. These are trigger points that are specific to the nuclear program itself, but also deal with things like their ballistic missile program.  Tillerson explained what he saw as the benefit of putting these “trigger points” into federal law, saying they would then form a more permanent part of American Iran policy. The provisions of a reform bill would extend beyond the sunset provisions of the JCPOA and would require both a future President and Congress to overturn, addressing what Tillerson called “a countdown clock to when Iran can resume its nuclear weapons development program.”  “The President also would like to have the Congress deal with that expiry within INARA,” Tillerson said, arguing such a law would put Iran on notice that the trigger points would be part American-Iranian relations in perpetuity.  The president will also direct the Treasury Department to develop “targeted sanctions” against individuals and entities associated with the IRGC’s terrorist activities in the region. According to Tillerson, Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin will have “broad latitude” to impose such sanctions.  President Trump is expected to elaborate on these plans at his address to the nation on Iran at 12:45pm Eastern Daylight Time.",4.75,2,"[4.5, 5.0]"
317,1653,10,6,2017,2017-10-06,Vox,Friendly policies keep US oil and coal afloat far more than we thought,"The coal industry and its allies in the Trump administration have devoted considerable energy to arguing that subsidies to renewable energy have distorted energy markets and helped drive coal out of business. “Certain regulations and subsidies,” Energy Secretary Rick Perry has said, “are having a large impact on the functioning of markets, and thereby challenging our power generation mix.” You can guess which regulations and subsidies he’s talking about.  This is nothing new, of course. It is in keeping with a long conservative tradition of challenging the economic wisdom and effectiveness of energy subsidies.  At least, uh, some energy subsidies.  Energy analysts have made the point again and again that fossil fuels, not renewable energy, most benefit from supportive public policy. Yet this fact, so inconvenient to the conservative worldview, never seems to sink in to the energy debate in a serious way. The supports offered to fossil fuels are so old and familiar, they fade into the background. It is support offered to challengers — typically temporary, fragmentary, and politically uncertain support — that is forever in the spotlight.  So let’s change that. Let’s talk about “certain regulations and subsidies” — namely, the ones propping up US fossil fuels.  Three recent analyses can help. The first does the yeoman’s work of tallying up federal and state energy subsidies. The second shows the effect those subsidies have on oil and gas production. And the third shows how thoroughly the US coal industry is propped up by regulatory policy. Together, they paint a clear picture: The profits of US fossil fuels are built on a foundation of government assistance.  All right then. First: What gets subsidized, and how much?  US fossil fuel production is subsidized to the tune of $20 billion annually  Researchers at Oil Change International (OCI) set out to quantify the level of US fossil fuel subsidies, but before we get to their results, a few important caveats.  OCI is only counting direct production subsidies. As they acknowledge, that leaves out a great deal.  For one thing, it leaves out the annual $14.5 billion in consumption subsidies — things like the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which helps lower-income residents pay their (fuel oil) heating bills. (There are better ways to help poor people, but let’s leave that aside for now.)  It also leaves out subsidies for overseas fossil fuel projects ($2.1 billion a year).  Most significantly, OCI’s analysis leaves out indirect subsidies — things like the money the US military spends to protect oil shipping routes, or the unpaid costs of health and climate impacts from burning fossil fuels. These indirect subsidies reach to the hundreds of billions, dwarfing direct subsidies — the IMF says that, globally speaking, they amount to $5.3 trillion a year. But they are controversial and very difficult to measure precisely.  Finally, OCI acknowledges that its estimates of state-level subsidies are probably low, since many states don’t report the costs of tax expenditures (i.e., tax breaks and credits to industry), so data is difficult to come by.  All of which is to say: OCI has produced about the most conservative possible estimate of the subsidies received by fossil fuels in the US. These are solely production subsidies — taxpayer money that goes directly to producing more fossil fuels.  So what’s the verdict?  Adding everything up: $14.7 billion in federal subsidies and $5.8 billion in state-level incentives, for a total of $20.5 billion annually in corporate welfare.  Of that total, 80 percent goes to oil and gas, 20 percent to coal. On the right, subsidies are broken down by stage of production. Extraction gets the most.  Notice that asterisk by remediation, which refers to the cost of cleaning up environmental messes and abandoned infrastructure left behind by fossil fuels. Shady insurance, bonding, and liability-cap policies mean that taxpayers are probably on the hook for lots more than this in the end, but it’s difficult to quantify in advance.  There are dozens and dozens of fossil fuel production subsidies — OCI’s report has a whole appendix devoted to listing them — but here they are broken down by the biggest offenders:  You probably can’t read that text, so here are the top six:  Intangible drilling oil & gas deduction ($2.3 billion)  Excess of percentage over cost depletion ($1.5 billion)  Master Limited Partnerships tax exemption ($1.6 billion)  Last-in, first-out (LIFO) accounting ($1.7 billion)  Lost royalties from onshore and offshore drilling ($1.2 billion)  Low-cost leasing of coal-production in the Powder River Basin ($963 million)  (I listed six because that sixth one is the biggie for coal.)  These kinds of obscure tax loopholes and accounting tricks are not widely known or debated, partially because you have to be a tax lawyer to understand them, and partially because they are simply old. The single biggest one, the intangible drilling deduction, has been around for over a century!  As subsidies age, they start to look less like subsidies. They start looking like fixed features of the landscape, like mountains or rivers, rather than choices we are making. They just look like the status quo.  How does this compare to renewable energy subsidies? In terms of permanent tax expenditures, fossil fuels beat renewables by a 7-1 margin:  (The primary federal tax supports for renewable energy — the investment and production tax credits, respectively — are not permanent. They are set to phase out over the next five years, and are politically vulnerable in the meantime. But if you include them, Stephen Kretzmann of OCI confirmed for me over email, permanent fossil tax breaks still win, at $7.4 billion to $5.6 billion.)  If you ask people in fossil fuel industries, their support staff in conservative think tanks, or fossil-state politicians, they will tell you why these fossil fuel production subsidies are necessary. It’s always been this way. They’re more than paid back by tax revenue. Other industries get them too. (For the record: More than half the $20 billion is available to fossil fuels alone). They create jobs. They’re important for national security. Tax expenditures aren’t subsidies at all, if you think about it. Etc.  If the endless debate over energy subsidies has taught me anything, it’s that nobody thinks their own subsidy is a subsidy — and no one outside think tanks and universities really gives a damn about the economic distortions of subsidies as such. Everyone thinks their favored energy sources deserve support and the other guys’ don’t. Period. They use whatever economic argument is handy — “picking winners” if you’re against the subsidy, “supporting jobs” if you’re for it — but such arguments are always instrumental. As I said recently about coal’s rent-seeking, there are no true free marketeers in struggling industries.  Speaking of rent-seeking, here’s a final fun factoid from OCI:  In the 2015-2016 election cycle, oil, gas, and coal companies spent $354 million in campaign contributions and lobbying and received $29.4 billion in federal subsidies in total over those same years — an 8,200% return on investment.  Not bad.  So, do all these subsidies make a difference. Why, yes. Yes, they do.  How much do oil subsidies matter? A lot.  The effects of consumption subsidies are fairly well-understood, as it is fairly easy to aggregate consumer decisions and find patterns. But the effects of production subsidies are trickier to pin down; it is difficult to tie particular background subsidies to particular investment decisions by producers.  In an analysis published in Nature in October 2017, researchers from the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) attempt to clear this up, quantifying, to the extent possible, just how much a difference production subsidies make. They do this by focusing in on a specific economic decision on the part of producers: whether or not to develop a new oil field they’ve discovered.  After tallying up their own long list of production subsidies and attempting to calculate how those subsidies shift the economic returns of new production, they came to some pretty startling conclusions, emphasis mine:  We find that, at recent US oil prices of US$50 per barrel, tax preferences and other subsidies push nearly half of new, yet-to-be-developed oil into profitability. This potentially increases US oil production by almost 17 billion barrels over the next few decades, equivalent to 6 billion tonnes (Gt) of CO2.  Almost half of the new oil fields getting drilled would have been left alone if not for subsidies. That is no small effect!  The researchers acknowledge that the impact of subsidies on these decisions is extremely sensitive to oil prices. If oil prices rise back up to, say, $75bbl, as some forecasters project, the impact of subsidies will appear far smaller.  But at current low oil prices, subsidies are making a huge, huge difference.  Coal is propped up by government policy too  As the charts from OCI show, direct federal tax expenditures on behalf of coal production are dwarfed by oil and gas subsidies. The main federal tax subsidy is cheap leases to mine coal on public land.  But as a report from Carbon Tracker details, coal is still very much propped up by public policy.  It’s no big revelation that new coal plants are uneconomic. There hasn’t been a new coal plant built in the US in years and there will probably never be another one, for reasons of raw economics. Here are net capacity additions and subtractions from the US power fleet, from 2011 to 2016:  As you can see, crappy old coal plants are coming offline and nobody’s building new plants to replace them.  Problem is, new coal plants have to be “clean,” which is to say, they have to have the filters and scrubbers to meet modern pollution standards. And as I’ve been saying for years, coal can either be cheap or clean, not both; making a new coal plant clean makes it uneconomic (to say nothing of what happens when you force it to bury its carbon).  What’s more striking is how imperiled existing, fully paid-off coal plants are. Even many of those can’t compete against natural gas or renewables.  Many existing coal plants are balanced on a fine edge. To the extent they can escape requirements to upgrade to modern pollution equipment — and believe it or not, decades after the Clean Air Act was passed, they still can — they can stay profitable for longer.  “When current costs are considered, 72% of operating coal units are unprofitable compared to the operating cost of an equivalent [natural gas plant],” Carbon Tracker writes, “and 98% when the anticipated costs [of environmental upgrades] are included.”  In other words, once the entire coal fleet upgrades to modern pollution standards ... basically none of it will be economically competitive. Cheap or clean; never both.  That’s a narrow path to remaining profitable, and coal plants are only on that path at all because of all the other ways they are propped up by regulatory policy:  Capacity markets favor already-built coal over new natural gas or renewables: Unlike electricity markets, which pay for power, capacity markets pay for the ability to spin up, just in case. They are a way of maintaining reserve capacity in case other power plants unexpectedly go offline. For various reasons (see the report), such markets favor plants that are already amortized and have readily available fuel, i.e., generally coal plants. So yeah, even coal plants that rarely produce power still get paid to sit around and ... not be closed.

So yeah, even coal plants that rarely produce power still get paid to sit around and ... not be closed. In regulated energy markets, utilities get paid to keep investing in unneeded, expensive coal plants: In competitive energy markets, plants close if they can’t make enough profit from their power to cover their ongoing costs. But in fully regulated markets (which contain 67 percent of US coal capacity), a utility’s return on investment in a plant is guaranteed by regulators, whether or not closing that plant would be better for ratepayers (as it very often would). Ironically, that’s why more coal plants in regulated markets have pollution-control equipment. In competitive markets, that would render them uneconomic (better just to shut them down). But in regulated markets, hell, why not? Every bit of investment means more guaranteed profits.  Utilities shuffle coal plants from their deregulated side to their regulated side, to shield them from competition: This one is so devious. Utility holding companies — which own utilities in both regulated and deregulated markets — move coal plants from the books of the latter to the books of the former, to shield them from competition and keep them alive via regulation. “This accounting practice typically shifts the economic burden from the shareholder to the consumer,” Carbon Tracker writes, “with the former often benefiting to the detriment of the latter.

Utilities hedge against changing natural gas costs: Some forecasters expect natural gas prices to rise in coming years (though, honestly, everyone is guessing). To hedge against that, utilities often keep uneconomic coal plants open, just in case rising NG prices retroactively render them economic.  This is just a partial accounting. The broader point is that the edifice of regulation governing the US electricity sector favors coal incumbents in myriad ways.  If all coal plants had to adopt their full costs and face full market competition tomorrow, the US coal fleet would quickly shrink to negligible size. It only survives because, through taxes and regulations, the US has protected it.  All three reports make it clear we’re accelerating in the wrong direction  All three reports are very clear that, to achieve the global target of limiting temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius or less this century, fossil fuels will have to be aggressively phased out.  As OCI shows, staying within a 2 degrees Celsius carbon budget means that we can’t even burn all the fossil fuels in already developed reserves:  Hitting our target means no new fossil fuel exploration, no new fields or mines, no new development.  Carbon Tracker, meanwhile, develops a detailed scenario for phasing out the US coal fleet on schedule with a 2 degrees Celsius carbon budget. Here’s what it looks like:  (B2DS and 2DS are two International Energy Agency scenarios. You don’t need to worry about the difference.)  The 2C carbon budget dictates an extremely rapid phaseout — far faster than anything currently projected by utilities themselves.  That is the background against which to understand fossil fuel subsidies: They are intrinsically incompatible with current climate goals.  So, let’s take a step back and sum up.  Right now, the US pays rhetorical fealty to a carbon goal that would require stopping all new fossil fuel development and phasing out all coal plants.  Meanwhile, US taxpayers are spending tens of billions of dollars a year subsidizing new fossil fuel exploration and exploitation, and US regulatory policy keeps the zombie coal fleet shambling on.  All the while, conservatives complain volubly about subsidies to renewable energy and the US energy secretary tries to use them as an excuse to dump even more public money on coal companies.  It’s a train wreck.  But still. The oil and gas companies making decisions to develop new fields and the utilities keeping coal plants alive are going to realize, at some point, that their vulnerability to “carbon risk” grows every year. (Arguably, big oil is way ahead of big coal in understanding this.)  The Obama administration identified $8.7 billion a year in federal fossil fuel subsidies to eliminate, but couldn’t get it past Congress. Now both sides of Pennsylvania Avenue are fossil-addled.  But if the US ever does get serious about mitigating climate change, those companies are going to be the ones caught with their pants down, holding a bunch of high-carbon assets that are destined to be stranded.  US fossil fuel companies and utilities are basically gambling on the continued perversity of US energy policy. It’s not a terrible bet — an odds-on winner, historically speaking, and probably for the next few years — but it can’t last forever.  Can it?",2.25,2,"[4.0, 0.5]"

Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama appeared together on stage at the start of the concert at Texas A&M University in College Station. Carter, Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama later made brief remarks appealing for national unity to to help those affected by hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.  ""The heart of America, without regard to race or religion or political party, is greater than our problems,"" said Clinton.  The charitable appeal backed by the ex-presidents has raised $31 million since it began on Sept. 7, said Jim McGrath, spokesman for George H.W. Bush.  Grammy award winner Lady Gaga made a surprise appearance at the concert that also featured country music band Alabama, Rock & Roll Hall of Famer 'Soul Man' Sam Moore, gospel legend Yolanda Adams and Texas musicians Lyle Lovett and Robert Earl Keen.  The current president, Donald Trump, recorded a video message for the concert praising his predecessors as ""some of America's finest public servants.""  ""This wonderful effort reminds us that we truly are one nation under God, all unified by our values and devotion to one another,"" Trump said.  Texas A&M is home to the presidential library of the elder Bush. At 93, he has a form of Parkinson's disease and appeared in a wheelchair at the event. His wife Barbara and George W. Bush's wife Laura Bush were in the audience.  The last time the five were together was at the dedication of George W. Bush's presidential library in Dallas, while Obama was still in office.  There is precedent for former presidents joining forces for post-disaster fundraising. George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton raised money together after the 2004 South Asia tsunami and Hurricane Katrina the next year. Clinton and George W. Bush combined to seek donations after Haiti's 2011 earthquake.  Hurricane Harvey slammed into Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast as a Category 4 hurricane on Aug. 25, unleashing historic flooding in Houston and killing more than 80 people.

His father, George H.W. Bush, then replies, ""We love you, Texas.""  Hurricane Irma subsequently hit Florida and Hurricane Maria battered Puerto Rico, while both devastated the U.S. Virgin Islands.

U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed to redo the North American Free Trade Agreement, but NAFTA has widened access to Mexican and Canadian markets, boosting U.S. farm exports and benefiting many farmers. Hurst says NAFTA has been good for his business and worries that he'll lose out in a renegotiation. (AP Photo/Nati Harnik, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — The North American Free Trade Agreement is in its 23rd year. But there are growing doubts that it will survive through its 24th.  President Donald Trump has threatened to withdraw from the agreement if he can’t get what he wants in a renegotiation. But what he wants — from requiring that more auto production be made-in-America to shifting more government contracts to U.S. companies — will likely be unacceptable to America’s two NAFTA partners, Mexico and Canada.  Round 4 of NAFTA talks began Wednesday in Arlington, Virginia. In a sign of how contentious things could get, the countries extended the negotiations for two extra days, through Tuesday.  “What is the administration going to do? Are they going to be patient and work through these things?” asks Phil Levy, senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. “Or are they going to take this as a pretext and say, ‘We tried negotiations; they failed. Now we need to blow this up?’ ”  Blowing up the deal appears to be Trump’s favored choice. On the campaign trail, he called NAFTA a job-killing disaster. And in an interview with Forbes magazine published Tuesday, Trump said: “I happen to think that NAFTA will have to be terminated if we’re going to make it good. Otherwise, I believe you can’t negotiate a good deal.”  Levy pegs the chance of NAFTA’s survival at less than 50 percent.  The end of NAFTA would send economic tremors across the continent. American farmers depend on Mexico’s market. Manufacturers have built complicated supply chains that cross NAFTA borders. Consumers have benefited from lower costs.  NAFTA erased most trade barriers along the United States, Canada and Mexico and led to an explosion in trade between the three countries. But critics say the pact sent hundreds of thousands of U.S. manufacturing jobs to Mexico, where corporations took advantage of low-wage labor.  Before the renegotiation began in August, many business and farm groups hoped the Trump administration would settle for tweaking rather than abandoning the trade deal — updating it, for example, to reflect the rise of e-commerce. But U.S. Trade Rep. Robert Lighthizer declared at the outset that the U.S. wouldn’t be satisfied with anything but a major overhaul.  So the administration has been seeking to ensure that more auto production be made in America to receive NAFTA benefits, that more government contracts in the NAFTA bloc go to U.S. companies and that NAFTA expire unless the countries agreed every few years to extend it. It also wants to scrap a dispute-resolution process favored by Canada.  Those proposals are considered poison pills by Canada and Mexico.  Visiting Washington on Wednesday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters that he thinks “it is very important and very possible to get a win-win-win” from the NAFTA talks. But he acknowledged that “we have to be ready for anything — and we are.”  The negotiators are under pressure to reach a deal this year — before presidential elections in Mexico and midterm elections in the United States raise the political temperature in 2018.  “The administration set itself the task of doing a really radical overhaul and having it done by Christmas,” says Levy, a former trade adviser to President George W. Bush. “I’m not surprised that Ambassador Lighthizer hasn’t been able to square that circle.”  Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Trade, says Trump “very likely” has the legal authority to withdraw from NAFTA on his own if talks collapse. But Congress can fight back. Lawmakers could pass a resolution calling on the president to obtain congressional authority before invoking the NAFTA clause that lets countries pull out. They could also threaten to block the president’s agenda unless he secures congressional approval to withdraw.  If the United States left NAFTA, trade barriers to Canada and Mexico would pop back up. Some of the tariffs wouldn’t be especially high. But Mexican tariffs on many American farm products could soar — to as high as 37 percent on corn, for example, notes Caroline Freund, a senior fellow at Peterson.  For that reason, many agricultural lobbies and lawmakers from farm states have urged the administration to “do no harm” in the NAFTA talks.  Daniel Ujczo, a trade lawyer with Dickinson Wright PLLC, predicts that Canada and Mexico would likely call a timeout if the United States insists on pushing contentious proposals.  “The Canadian and Mexican strategy will be to take a pause,” he says, and “allow the U.S. domestic process to play itself out” with business and farm groups and many lawmakers rising to defend NAFTA.  NAFTA supporters are already rallying.

Owens says that he mentions arthritis but not in his initial conversations with young injured athletes.  “Most young athletes just want to focus on the problem at hand,” he said. “Yesterday in my office, I saw a 17-year-old soccer player. ‘Yes, you tore your A.C.L.’ The tears start to come. It is hard to talk to a 17-year-old about what their knee will be like in 20 years.”  Although Lalli, the former soccer player, said his arthritis diagnosis was a shock, he also said that knowing that it might happen would not have made much difference. He might have a genetic predisposition toward knee arthritis. His father took up soccer in his late 40s and had to have surgery at 50 when he tore the A.C.L. in his left knee.  Then he tore the meniscus — a piece of cartilage that acts as a cushion between the shinbone and the thighbone — in his right knee. He got arthritis later but thought it was because of his age, not his injuries.  Lalli’s arthritis progressed despite his receiving a second A.C.L. reconstruction that was more tailored to the anatomy of his knee. His initial operation had been done by a surgeon who did not position the new ligament in the exact place it had been before.  Lalli had the subsequent operation done by Dr. Freddie Fu, the chairman of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. Fu is a leader in A.C.L. operations that are more anatomically specific, and his procedure stabilized Lalli’s knee. Nonetheless, Lalli has faced years of disabling pain.  Four years ago, when his arthritis got so bad that he gave up playing soccer, Lalli asked for a knee replacement. Fu refused, telling him that artificial knees last only 10 or 15 years in younger and active people and that each knee replacement is more problematic than the one before.",4.666666666666667,3,"[4.5, 5.0, 4.5]"

Credit monitoring company Equifax says a breach exposed social security numbers and other data from about 143 million Americans. The Atlanta-based company said Thursday, Sept. 7, 2017, that ""criminals"" exploited a U.S. website application to access files between mid-May and July of this year. (AP Photo/Mike Stewart)  NEW YORK (AP) — A day after credit-reporting company Equifax disclosed that “criminals” had stolen vital data about 143 million Americans, it had somehow managed to leave much of the public in the dark about their exposure, how they should protect themselves and what Equifax planned to do for those affected.  The breach is unquestionably serious. It exposed crucial pieces of personal data that criminals could use to commit identity theft, from Social Security numbers and birthdates to address histories and legal names.  That data — the “crown jewels of personal information,” in the words of independent credit analyst John Ulzheimer — can’t be changed, and once it’s in circulation, it’s basically out there forever.  But Equifax’s response has satisfied almost no one.  UNHAPPINESS EVERYWHERE  Consumers complained of jammed phone lines and uninformed representatives. An Equifax website set up to help people determine their exposure looked like a scam to some, and provided inconsistent and unhelpful information to others. Congress planned hearings.  Anders Ohlsson, a 47-year-old technical manager in Scotts Valley, California, called a hotline multiple times and was disconnected; entered the last six digits of his Social Security number into Equifax’s emergency website; and finally spoke with a call center manager. He still doesn’t know whether his information has been compromised.  “I don’t think I’ve gotten hold of a person that actually cares,” he said. “Now they’re fumbling to tell people what’s going on. But they really don’t know what’s going on.”  Equifax plays a key role in the financial industry, making this breach more alarming than previous ones at Yahoo or retailers. The company is a storehouse of personal information, like how much people owe on their houses and whether they have court judgments against them.  Lenders rely on the information collected by three big credit bureaus — Equifax, TransUnion and Experian — to help them decide on financing for homes, cars and credit cards. Credit checks are sometimes done by employers when deciding whom to hire for a job.  WHAT YOU CAN DO  Even if you don’t know if you’re one of the 143 million, you might want to consider extreme protective measures.  Your strongest immediate option involves placing a credit freeze on their files with the major credit bureaus. That locks down your information, making it impossible for outsiders to open new accounts and bank cards in your name. But it also blocks you from opening new accounts, and might involve fees depending on the state you live in.  “The credit freeze is the nuclear option of credit protection,” said Matt Schulz, an analyst with CreditCards.com. “But in the wake of a breach this big, it’s worth considering.”  You should also be more diligent about checking your credit reports, where you can see if anyone has opened unauthorized accounts in your name . You can get those files for free once a year from the three major bureaus; use the official site, annualcreditreport.com .  It’s best to spread those requests out by getting one every four months. And you’ll need to be ready to keep checking for a while — potentially years.  “Bad guys can be very patient with data,” Schulz said.  If you’re not ready for the freeze, Ulzheimer recommends setting up fraud alerts on your files. These force creditors to contact you directly, usually by phone, for approval before approving an account.  And if you’ve been a victim of repeated identity fraud, you can request a new Social Security number with the Social Security Administration.  In addition to the emergency Equifax website, https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com/, you can also call 866-447-7559 for information. The company also says it will send mail to all who had personally identifiable information stolen.  HOW EQUIFAX REACTED  Any data breach threatens to tarnish a company’s reputation, but Equifax hasn’t done much to minimize that damage.  Atlanta-based Equifax said Thursday the breach took place between mid-May and July of this year. It discovered the hack July 29, but waited until Thursday to warn consumers. Its communications with the public have so far been limited to official statements.  Then there’s the company’s emergency-information website. To Georgia Weidman, founder and chief technology officer for security firm Shevirah, it looks a lot like the kind of site scammers would use to trick people into giving up passwords or other crucial information.  “It’s teaching people entirely the wrong things about using the internet securely,” Weidman said. She said says she’s also troubled by Equifax’s approach to security generally, including reports that it didn’t respond to basic scripting bugs it was warned about last year.  Company officials are also under scrutiny. Three Equifax executives sold shares worth a combined $1.8 million just a few days after the company discovered the breach, according to documents filed with securities regulators. Equifax said the three executives — one of them the company’s chief financial officer — didn’t know about the breach at the time of the sales, but didn’t answer further questions.  Equifax’s security lapse could be the largest theft involving Social Security numbers, one of the most common ways to confirm a person’s identity in the U.S. It eclipses a 2015 hack at health insurer Anthem Inc. that involved the Social Security numbers of about 80 million people .  FALLOUT  Washington regulators and politicians swiftly criticized Equifax, and Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said he will call for congressional hearings.  An Equifax requirement that appeared to force affected customers into arbitration also drew a backlash. Democrats in the House and Senate called on the company to pull back from language that suggested anyone who signs up for credit monitoring also gives up their right to join a class-action lawsuit against Equifax.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the nation’s chief watchdog for financial services, likewise blasted the arbitration requirement. The CFPB recently passed a rule requiring financial companies to let customers sue together when a large group has been wronged.  New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman said he was starting his own investigation.  After a day of all that, Equifax released a statement Friday evening declaring that the arbitration requirement and class-action waiver will not apply to this particular breach. The company also said it had fixed problems with the emergency website and tripled its call center team to over 2,000 agents.  Equifax shares fell about 13 percent to $123.75 in heavy trading. The decline equates to about $2.28 billion in lost market value.  ___  AP Technology Writers Michael Liedtke and Ryan Nakashima in San Francisco, and Matt O’Brien in New York, contributed to this report.",4.75,2,"[5.0, 4.5]"
161,958,6,1,2017,2017-06-01,Vox,LeBron James means a lot to Cleveland — and its economy,"LeBron James, the most dominant basketball player of his generation and perhaps the game’s most gifted creator on the court, is also a historic force at creating ... jobs.  That’s right. Wherever the three-time NBA champion goes, businesses and jobs follow. Some economists with the American Enterprise Institute quantified his impact in new research published last month.  One of the allures of professional sports is ostensibly the economic benefits for their home cities. Team owners, though usually billionaires themselves, often make that case when they ask local taxpayers to pony up hundreds of millions or billions of dollars to fund new stadiums and arenas.  Some researchers have argued that new sports facilities don’t have any economic upside — and might actually have a negative influence. Roger Noll of Stanford University and Andrew Zimbalist of Smith College devoted much of their book on sports economics to that issue.  But a generational talent and cultural phenom like James? In the downtowns where he plies his trade, the economic benefits he brings are very real, according to research by Daniel Shoag and Stan Veuger, who wrote their analysis for AEI.  (This is where I should disclose, I suppose, that I grew up 90 minutes south of Cleveland and have rooted for James and the Cavaliers since he came into the league in 2003. James and the Cavs, defending NBA champions, face the Golden State Warriors for the third consecutive NBA Finals, starting tonight.)  Shoag and Veuger place their analysis in that broader context of whether sports actually benefit their local economies, as well as building on recent research that superstars do increase attendance at sporting events. James’s career also provides a tidy economic experiment, because he spent his first seven years in Cleveland, left for Miami for four years, and then returned to Cleveland in 2014.  Here is how they summarize their findings:  “We find that Mr. James has a statistically and economically significant positive effect on both the number of restaurants and other eating and drinking establishments near the stadium where he is based, and on aggregate employment at those establishments.”  Specifically, James’s presence increased the number of restaurants and bars within one mile of his team’s arena by 13 percent, they found, and increased employment at those establishments by 23.5 percent.  The effects were felt most strongly within one mile of the arena, started to dissipate but were still present within seven miles, and then disappeared completely. So the LeBron effect is real, but it is fairly limited to the areas near where he plays basketball. The outreaches of the Cleveland and Miami metropolitan area did not see much of a benefit.  James giveth and taketh away — and not only for fans, who (I can attest) were ecstatic when he came, distraught when he left, and overjoyed when he returned.  Look at these two charts, showing the number of eating and drinking joints within one mile of the Cleveland and Miami arenas. Remember, James was in Cleveland from 2006 to 2010, then in Miami from 2010 to 2014, and back in Cleveland from 2014 to now.  The dots tell the tale. The number of establishments near Cleveland’s Quicken Loans Arena fell from more than 190 during James’s first tenure, to less than 170 after he left, and then spiked to more than 210 upon his return. In Miami, the number of bars and restaurants near American Airlines Arena steadily increased while James was there, hitting a high of 250-plus, before falling off slightly after James returned to Cleveland.  Of course, while the pattern is clear, James can’t take all the credit — he doesn’t dominate a local economy in the same way he dominates a basketball game. Shoag and Veuger did their best to isolate the LeBron effect and concluded his specific influence was felt far more in Cleveland than in Miami.  “Two potential explanations come to mind. Perhaps Mr. James is particularly beloved in his native Ohio,” they wrote. “Or maybe ‘superstar amenities’ are substitutes, not complements, and Miami has plenty of them even without Mr. James, generating fiercer competition and an attenuated impact of any specific superstar.”  I’m going with the first one.",2.875,4,"[2.0, 4.5, 0.5, 4.5]"

Air pollution in India's capital has hit hazardous levels prompting local officials to ask that school shut down and a half marathon scheduled later in November be called off. (AP Photo/Manish Swarup)  NEW DELHI (AP) — A thick gray haze enveloped India’s capital on Tuesday as air pollution hit hazardous levels, prompting local officials to ask that schools shut down and a half marathon scheduled for later in November be called off.  The readings of the government’s air quality index hovered between 350 and 450, indicating that the health impact of breathing the air was “severe.” The highest reading on the Central Pollution Control Board’s index is 500. The pollutants on Tuesday that had the maximum impact on the reading were PM 2.5 and PM 10 particulate matter.  As winter approaches, a thick, soupy smog routinely envelops most parts of northern India, caused by dust, the burning of crops, emissions from factories and the burning of coal and piles of garbage as the poor try to keep warm.  Over the past two years, New Delhi has earned the dubious distinction of being one of the world’s most polluted cities.  On Tuesday, Belgium’s King Philippe and Queen Mathilde, in India on a weeklong state visit, inspected a military guard of honor at the sprawling presidential palace in New Delhi under a cover of smog that hampered visibility.  As the haze settled over the city in the morning, many people covered their faces and noses with scarves to try to protect themselves. Arvind Kejriwal, the capital’s top elected official, asked the education department to consider closing down schools.  The Indian Medical Association said New Delhi was in the midst of a “public health emergency” and appealed to the city government to halt sports and other outdoor activities in schools. The association also said the Delhi Half Marathon, scheduled for Nov. 19, was likely to leave those participating especially badly hit because the air quality is worst during the early part of the day, when the run takes place.  The sharp drop in air quality is most dangerous for the elderly, children and those already suffering from respiratory ailments. Constant exposure to pollution also reduces lung functionality for healthy adults over a period of time.  According to a recent report by the Lancet medical journal on the impact of pollution across the world, one out of every four premature deaths in India in 2015, or some 2.5 million, was attributed to pollution.  Delhi has struggled with putting in place pollution control measures over the last two years. It has tightened vehicle and factory emission norms and reduced the number of cars on the roads on the worst-hit days. But it’s had a hard time enforcing laws about crop burning, garbage fires and construction dust.  Kejriwal said on Twitter on Tuesday that his government had written to ministers in the neighboring states of Punjab and Haryana demanding an end to crop burning there, but that little had been done.  “All of us together have to find a (solution) to this,” he tweeted, adding that the city becomes a “gas chamber for almost a month” every year.",4.5,1,[4.5]

There’s just $57,000 left in it — and public health experts say a serious response to the addiction crisis would cost $183 billion over the next decade.  For public health officials, doctors, and treatment advocates on the ground in states hardest hit by the epidemic, the federal government — under both the Obama and Trump administrations — has been slow to respond to America’s deadliest drug crisis, which killed a record 64,000 Americans last year.  Trump’s Thursday declaration, though encouraging, wasn’t the decisive action that many were looking for.  “I think it was a step forward but it wasn’t the big step, because it does not bring new money,” said Tym Rourke, chair of the New Hampshire Governors Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery and a longtime treatment advocate in the state. New Hampshire has the second-highest rate of fatal drug overdoses in the nation, behind West Virginia.  “There are unmet needs right now that this declaration, while welcome, does not address,” Rourke said. “If we don’t get additional resources on the ground, there is only so much positive impact we can have.”  In West Virginia, where the death toll from heroin, fentanyl, and prescription opioids is the worst in the United States, public health officials say they want help from the federal government matching the scale of the devastation they see every day.  “People are dying out here,” said Michael Brumage, executive director of the Kanawha-Charleston Health Department in Charleston, West Virginia, in a recent interview. “We are having a Vietnam in America every single year from overdoses. If this is a war, why would we not apply the resources as we could?”  Brumage said he believes there’s a disconnect between government officials in Washington, DC, and people who are seeing the toll of the drug crisis play out every day in America’s communities.  “When you’re sitting in a position of power and you’re removed from the day-to-day misery of this epidemic, I believe it’s easy to dismiss,” he said. “I think at an intellectual level they see the numbers of deaths from overdoses, but they’re abstractions because they’re figures on a piece of paper.”  “The public health hurricane of our generation”  Hard-hit states like New Hampshire and West Virginia have already had mixed experiences with the government’s response to the opioid crisis: They’ve gotten much less help than states with lower death rates.  The 21st Century Cures Act, passed last year, included $1 billion to be dispersed among states for drug treatment. The bill’s intent was for more federal money to go to states with the highest per capita drug death rates.  But after the bill was signed into law by President Obama, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration changed the funding formula to take into account states with the biggest overall numbers of overdose deaths.  That meant more populous states like California, Florida, and Texas got the most money, even though their per capita death rates were much lower. New Hampshire, with the second-highest death rate in the nation, received about $6.2 million over two years. Texas, with the fourth-lowest per capita rate for drug fatalities in the US, received $27.4 million.  Michael Fraser, the executive director of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, called the 21st Century Cures Act money “the first down payment in what’s going to be a long term investment” fighting the crisis.  Trump’s declaration Thursday will do several things, including letting states shift federal funds dedicated for HIV to also deal with opioid addiction, allow the US Department of Health and Human Services dedicate more staff to the addiction crisis, and let patients use telemedicine to get medication-assisted treatment like methadone or buprenorphine.  Fraser says he’s optimistic the declaration will help federal agencies streamline their response to the crisis and work more efficiently with states. But it’s now up to Congress to appropriate more money to help combat the opioid epidemic.  Administration officials said Thursday that they expect Congress’s December spending bill to contain money for treatment, but gave no specific dollar amount. But any congressional response is likely to fall far short of what some experts believe is needed to solve the crisis: close to $183 billion.  “If you’re going to actually do something, you’re going to have to put down some serious capacity building money,” said Richard G. Frank, a health economics professor at Harvard Medical School who has written extensively on the cost of treating addiction.  Every bit of money from the state and federal governments is helpful, said Dr. Rahul Gupta, West Virginia’s state health commissioner. Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion helped 50,000 people in the state get drug treatment, and the state received $5.8 million from the federal government this year as part of the 21st Century Cures Act.  “This is the public health hurricane of our generation,” Rourke said. “We are running against the clock.”  The epidemic goes beyond deaths  Why is the epidemic so expensive? Because while drug overdose deaths are often what gets the most attention, treatment advocates, doctors, and public health officials say they are just the tip of the iceberg. The opioid crisis has turned into what Tufts University assistant professor Thomas Stopka called a “syndemic,” “multiple diseases feeding off each other.”  IV drug use, for example, led to rates of hepatitis C infections tripling nationwide from 2010 to 2015. If untreated, the virus can liver cancer or cirrhosis years later; there is a cure, but it costs tens of thousands of dollars, and many state Medicaid programs won’t cover it unless the patient’s liver is starting to fail.  In Kentucky, Dr. Jennifer Havens, a researcher at the University of Kentucky’s College of Medicine, says many of the drug users she sees who test positive for hepatitis C are young. And she describes the reaction she’s seen from many young drug users who test positive for hepatitis C as “complete and utter apathy,” because drug use and disease has become a part of daily life.  “We’ve had very few people that have been upset by the news,” Havens said. “It’s kind of inevitable, and now it’s kind of endemic.”  Beyond hepatitis C, many drug users develop abscesses and soft tissue infections from drug use. Some of these can be cleared up with antibiotics, but if infections become more serious and travel to the heart, a patient may need their heart valve replaced, a procedure that can cost between $100,000 to $200,000.  Then there’s the toll on children of addicted parents, including babies born dependent to drugs in the womb if their mothers are still using, and the thousands of children who have to go into foster care because their parents are dead from an overdose or can’t take care of them due to active drug use.  “This is an epidemic like no other because it touches every fabric of society,” said Gupta.  A 2016 report found that prescription opioid abuse alone was costing America $78.5 billion, including $20 billion in lost productivity, $28 billion in health care costs, $21.5 billion in overdose deaths, and another $7.7 billion in criminal justice costs.  “The cost is tremendous,” Gupta said. “It’s the Boeing 737 crashing every single day.”",3.4,5,"[3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 2.5]"

969,2509,10,25,2017,2017-10-25,Fox News,"'Smoking gun' email reveals Obama DOJ blocked conservative groups from settlement funds, GOP lawmaker says","The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee claims he obtained a “smoking gun” email that proves the Obama Justice Department prevented settlement payouts from going to conservative-leaning organizations, even as liberal groups were awarded money and DOJ officials denied “picking and choosing” recipients.  “It is not every day in congressional investigations that we find a smoking gun,” Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said Tuesday. “Here, we have it.”  While Eric Holder was U.S. attorney general, the Justice Department allowed prosecutors to strike agreements compelling big companies to give money to outside groups not connected to their cases to meet settlement burdens. Republican lawmakers long have decried those payments as a “slush fund” that boosted liberal groups, and the Trump DOJ ended the practice earlier this year.  But internal Justice Department emails released Tuesday by Goodlatte indicated that not only were officials involved in determining what organizations would get the money, but also Justice Department officials may have intervened to make sure the settlements didn’t go to conservative groups.  In one such email in July 2014, a senior Justice Department official expressed “concerns” about what groups would receive settlement money from Citigroup — saying they didn’t want money going to a group that does “conservative property-rights legal services.”  DOJ ENDS HOLDER-ERA ‘SLUSH FUND’ PAYOUTS TO OUTSIDE GROUPS  “Concerns include: a) not allowing Citi to pick a statewide intermediary like the Pacific Legal Foundation (does conservative property-rights legal services),” the official, whose name is redacted in the email, wrote under the title of “Acting Senior Counselor for Access to Justice.”  The official added that “we are more likely to get the right result from a state bar association affiliated entity.”  The Pacific Legal Foundation responded to the email release Tuesday by telling Fox News it believes “permanent reforms to prevent such abuse are needed.”  “We are flattered that the previous administration would be concerned enough about our success vindicating individual liberty and property rights to prevent settlement funds from making their way to Pacific Legal Foundation,” PLF CEO Steven D. Anderson said in a statement.  Goodlatte, who is sponsoring the Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act of 2017, disclosed the emails during a speech on the House floor, taking aim at then-Associate Attorney General Tony West.  “Aiding their political allies was only the half of it,” Goodlatte said. “The evidence of the Obama DOJ’s abuse of power shows that Tony West’s team went out of its way to exclude conservative groups.”  The documents indicate West played an active role in helping certain organizations obtain settlement information.  “Can you explain to Tony the best way to allocate some money to an organization of our choosing?” Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General Elizabeth Taylor wrote in one November 2013 email.  Groups who received funding also expressed appreciation for West’s efforts, according to the emails.  “Now that it has been more than 24 hours for us all to try and digest the Bank of America settlement, I would like to discuss ways we might want to recognize and show appreciation for the Department of Justice and specifically Associate Attorney General Tony West,” wrote Charles R. Dunlap, executive director of the Indiana Bar, in an August 2014 email.  Dunlap wrote that West “by all accounts was the one person most responsible” for the Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts group receiving money.  One person, Bob LeClair, responded to Dunlap’s email by saying, “Frankly, I would be willing to have us build a statue [of West] and then we could bow down to this statue each day after we get our $200,000.”  West, who now works as an executive vice president at PepsiCo, did not immediately return an email from Fox News seeking comment.  In 2015, however, Geoffrey Graber, who oversaw the Justice Department’s big banks settlements, told Goodlatte during a congressional hearing that the department “did not want to be in the business of picking and choosing which organizations may or may not receive any funding under the agreement.”  “But internal DOJ documents tell a different story,” Goodlatte said Tuesday. “They show that contrary to Graber’s sworn testimony, the donation provisions were structured to aid the Obama administration’s political friends and exclude conservative groups.”  Even before the release of Tuesday’s emails, Republicans had blasted these settlements as a “slush fund” for favored groups.  Gibson Guitars was forced to pay $50,000 to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation in 2012, though that organization has nothing to do with the case. In 2014, Bank of America gave money to the National Urban League, the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America and the National Council of La Raza as part of a major mortgage fraud settlement stemming from the 2008 financial crisis.  'Aiding their political allies was only the half of it.' — House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va.  Asked about the emails, the Justice Department on Tuesday referred Fox News to Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ statement in June after he announced the end to the practice.  “When the federal government settles a case against a corporate wrongdoer, any settlement funds should go first to the victims and then to the American people — not to bankroll third-party special interest groups or the political friends of whoever is in power,” Sessions said.  Goodlatte on Tuesday praised Sessions’ move to end mandatory donations, but called his legislation a “good governance measure,” and called it necessary to prevent a future Justice Department from reversing the action. The bill prohibits the Justice Department from requiring defendants to donate money to outside groups as part of a settlement with the federal government.

1421,3041,11,5,2017,2017-11-05,Fox News,Newt Gingrich: Why Trump's tax plan has me feeling so optimistic,"The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that Republicans introduced Thursday represents a tremendous opportunity for the Congress and the President to take the U.S. economy to a new level of prosperity and improve the lives of hundreds of millions of Americans.  As I wrote earlier this week, the Trump effect has already brought gross domestic product (GDP) growth up to 3 percent for two straight quarters – which so-called experts insisted for months was nearly impossible.  At the same time, Pew Research Center reported on Tuesday that 82 percent of Americans now say they have either achieved their definition of the American Dream or are on their way to achieving it. The Washington Examiner points out that this is a stark contrast to 2014, when a similar CNN project found that 60 percent of Americans thought the American Dream was unattainable.  The tax relief and job creating provisions included in the Republican plan will continue to grow the GDP and help even more Americans realize their dreams.  If passed by Congress and signed into law by President Trump, Americans will get to keep more of their hard-earned money. The Republican bill roughly doubles the standard deduction, increasing it from $12,000 to $24,000 for families and from $6,350 to $12,000 for individuals. This means families who earn the median household income ($59,000 a year) will only pay taxes on $35,000 of their income, which translates into a $1,182 tax cut for these families.  Further, the bill includes a Family Credit, which expands tax credits for families with children, as well as those caring for older relatives. The tax cut bill increases the current Child Tax Credit from $1,000 to $1,600 and provides a $300 credit for elderly parents and adult-dependents. Keep in mind, these are not deductions, these are dollar-for-dollar tax credits.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also drastically simplifies our tax system, which will enable Americans to save even more money. The bill gets rid of many deductions and loopholes that shift much of the tax burden onto the American middle class. This streamlining will allow most Americans to file their taxes on a form the size of a postcard, and the savings families will experience from this simplification will be like an additional income tax relief.  Many Americans will also see their wages and job opportunities increase due to the enormous reductions in business taxes included in the bill.  The bill sets a 25 percent maximum tax rate for small businesses and other pass-through corporations. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, these businesses represent 99.7 percent of U.S. employers – and employ nearly half of the private sector workforce. Giving these small business owners the ability to keep more of the money their businesses earn will result in an explosion of investment and job creation. This will then lead to wage increases, as companies will once again have to compete for job candidates.  Additionally, the tax rate for corporations will be reduced from 35 percent down to 20 percent. This cut – the largest corporate tax cut in our nation’s history – will make America competitive with the rest of the developed world, making our country more attractive to large manufacturers and other multinational businesses. This is perfectly in line with President Trump’s America first principle on which he campaigned last year and will lead to more products around the world being labeled “Made in America.”  Finally, the GOP bill also reforms our outdated multinational tax system so that businesses will once again be encouraged to bring foreign earnings back to the United States, instead of investing them and creating jobs overseas.  The passage of this bill will be a defining moment for our country. It will cut through all the noise of Washington and show Americans they were right to elect Republicans to lead in the White House and Congress.  Over the next few weeks, the Democrats and the left-wing media will undoubtedly try to oppose this bill. They will come up with all sorts of reasons why they don’t support the bill, but what they are truly arguing against is lower taxes, more jobs, higher wages, and a simpler, fairer system. The American people will see that once again, the Left is trying to stand in the way of our country’s working class, who are finally starting to see their American dreams become a reality.

The initial reaction from the Greens indicated that reaching an agreement on limiting the number of refugees could prove difficult.  “When you throw together asylum seekers, refugee contingents, resettlement programs and family members joining refugees all in one pot, and then set a limit of 200,000, one group will be thrown under the bus,” said Simone Peter, a co-leader of the Greens. “I would like to see how that can go along with humanitarian immigration.”  The numbers seeking refuge in Germany have fallen drastically during the last year, after Balkan countries began refusing people the right to cross illegally and after Europe reached a deal with Turkey to stem the flow. Fewer than 124,000 people applied for asylum in Germany in the first eight months of this year.  As part of their agreement, the conservatives also proposed legislation to allow for immigration of workers, in consultation with industries that have jobs to fill.

Further measures would include establishing more centers to process and assess arrivals’ applications.

Four U.S. soldiers were killed in October 2017 by Islamic militants who attacked their convoy in Africa with rocket-propelled grenades and heavy machine guns. The body of one soldier was not found for two days.  The Pentagon’s report, released on May 10, took three months to complete, spokeswoman Dana White said in a statement. Defense Secretary James Mattis found “institutional and organizational issues, not isolated to this event that must be addressed immediately by the Department of Defense,” she said.  “However, no amount of investigation or corrective action will ease the agonizing grief that the families of our fallen must feel,” White said. “The Department hopes that the families will take pride and comfort in knowing – as this investigation makes clear — that their loved ones fought and died bravely in defense of our Nation, its people and the values we hold dear.”  From President Donald Trump’s calls to the families of the deceased to the White House’s delayed response to the ambush, details about the attack have drawn intense scrutiny and criticism. Read on for a look at what happened in Niger.  Who were the Americans killed?  Sgt. La David Johnson, 25; Staff Sgt. Bryan Black, 35; Staff Sgt. Jeremiah Johnson 39; and Staff Sgt. Dustin Wright, 29, were killed in the attack.  The bodies of some of the Americans killed were recovered by a U.S.-contracted helicopter, a U.S. official previously told Fox News. Sgt. Johnson's body wasn't found until two days after the attack as he and some Nigerien soldiers were separated from the others during the battle, the Pentagon said.  According to the report, the four killed “gave their last full measure of devotion to our country and died with honor while actively engaging the enemy.” It said none were captured alive by the enemy and all died immediately or quickly from their wounds.  What did the Pentagon say happened?  The Pentagon’s summary lays out a confusing chain of events that unfolded on Oct. 3-4, ending in a lengthy, brutal firefight as 46 U.S. and Nigerien forces battled for their lives against more than 100 enemy fighters. Amid the chaos, the report identified repeated acts of bravery as the outnumbered and outgunned soldiers risked their lives to protect and rescue each other during the more than hour-long assault.  Military officials found that the U.S. forces didn’t have time to train together before they deployed and did not do pre-mission battle drills with their Nigerien partners. And the report found that there was a lack of attention to detail and lax communication about missions that led to a “general lack of situational awareness and command oversight at every echelon.”  According to the report, the Army Special Forces team left their camp on Oct. 3 to go after an Islamic State leader who was suspected of involvement in the kidnapping of an American aid worker. But the team leader and his immediate supervisor submitted a different mission to the higher command, saying they were going out just to meet tribal leaders. That less-risky mission was approved, and when the team got to the location, the insurgent wasn’t there.  Senior commanders, unaware of the team’s earlier actions, then ordered the troops to serve as backup for a second team’s raid, also targeting the leader. That mission was aborted, however, when weather grounded the second team. The original group was then ordered to another location to collect intelligence on the insurgent, which they did without problems.  It was on their way back to the home base when they stopped for water at the village of Tongo Tongo, about 120 miles north of Niger’s capital. There, the group was ambushed by Islamic State-linked militants armed with rocket-propelled grenade launchers and small firearms.  The Pentagon said it could not conclude that the village “willingly (and without duress)” aided and supported the militants in the attack.  What else should you know?  The report included multiple recommendations to improve mission planning and approval procedures, re-evaluate equipment and weapons requirements and review training that U.S. commandos conduct with partner forces.  Mattis has directed Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, head of U.S. Africa Command, to take immediate steps to address shortfalls and has given senior leaders four months to complete a review and lay out a plan for additional changes.  Why were troops in Niger?  U.S. forces have been in Niger for more than 20 years and a joint special operations task force was created by the U.S. in 2008.  In 2011, U.S. and French forces set up a counterterrorism force in the country, led by the French, with 4,000 troops and 35,000 Nigerien troops. There were 800 U.S. troops in Niger and 6,000 U.S. troops within 53 countries in Africa, Gen. Joe Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said last year.  But the presence of American soldiers in Niger reignited a debate about the Authorization for Use of Military Force – a public law enacted after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. At issue is whether the law gives the president the authority to take action against all terrorist organizations, not just Al Qaeda and the Taliban.  What was the White House's response?  The White House has been widely criticized for its response to the attack – especially in the delay in acknowledging the ambush.  President Trump, too, was criticized for his public feud with a Democratic congresswoman and Sgt. La David Johnson’s widow. Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., accused Trump of making “insensitive” remarks to Myeshia Johnson.  Trump has denied Wilson’s allegations, but the mother of the deceased soldier has backed up Wilson’s claims.  White House chief of staff John Kelly said he was ""heartbroken"" that Wilson used the conversation she overheard to attack Trump. Kelly, whose Marine son died in Afghanistan, added that the president did the best he could in the situation.  Because of the White House’s response to the attack, it’s been called “the president’s Benghazi” by some Democrats, referencing the controversial attack in 2012 that left four American service members dead.

Workers Strike in Canada as Mexico Jobs Raise Tension," Workers at a General Motors assembly plant in Ontario went on strike late Sunday as union leaders reported an impasse in talks to keep Canadian jobs from moving to Mexico.  It is the first strike at a Canadian auto assembly plant in 21 years. The roughly 2,750 unionized employees at the factory, in Ingersoll, Ontario, may have been emboldened because it builds the Chevrolet Equinox, a small sport-utility vehicle that is a sales success for G.M.  A union statement said negotiations had fallen apart over demands that Ingersoll be designated the primary assembly site for the Equinox. In July, production of the GMC Terrain, a similar vehicle, was moved to Mexico from Ingersoll, leading to the loss of 600 jobs at the Canadian factory. The Equinox is also made in Mexico.  “These workers are standing up for good jobs.

Speaking by phone to Breitbart News on Saturday, Corfman’s mother, Nancy Wells, 71, further stated that her daughter would not have come forward if it weren’t for The Post reporter’s alleged actions.  Earlier on Sunday, Breitbart News reported that Corfman’s mother contradicted a key detail of Corfman’s story. Speaking by phone to Breitbart News on Saturday, Wells said that her daughter did not have a phone in her bedroom during the period that Moore is reported to have allegedly called Corfman – purportedly on Corfman’s bedroom phone – to arrange at least one encounter.  The Washington Post cited Corfman as remembering that she provided Moore with her number when she was 14. She said that she spoke to Moore from what she described as the phone in her bedroom.  Today, the left got some very bad new about their hit job on Roy Moore…it appears that polls show Alabama voters aren’t buying it…  Breitbart News – Two new polls demonstrate that GOP nominee for the U.S. Senate Judge Roy Moore remains unaffected entirely by smears in the Washington Post against him, and his lead before the Post piece on Thursday afternoon remains intact.  One of the polls, which were both provided by the pollster to Breitbart News exclusively on Saturday evening, was conducted on Thursday morning before the publication of the Post piece that afternoon. The second one was conducted on Saturday evening. Together, they show Judge Moore’s lead over Democrat Doug Jones has been virtually unaffected since the Post story came out.  The first survey, which was conducted entirely before noon local time on Thursday, shows Moore leading Jones by 50 percent to 39.2 percent with 10.8 percent undecided. That survey of 1,354 likely voters in the upcoming Dec. 12 special election has a margin of error of 3.5 percent.  The second survey, conducted Saturday evening—two days after the Post piece hit, roiling Alabama’s political scene—shows Moore and Jones with about the exact same percentages as before. Moore’s position in this second poll is 49.8 percent—meaning he only dropped 0.2 percent since the story hit—and Jones has only picked up 0.4 percent to reach 39.6 percent total. The second survey, which polled 1,536 likely voters with a margin of error of 3.3 percent, has 10.5 percent as undecided.  “The polling between Thursday morning and Saturday showed far less movement than I originally expected,” pollster John Wahl told Breitbart News. “The controversy surrounding the Washington Post article seems to have galvanized the support of both candidates, but not changed the actual percentages in a significant manner. The Moore campaign has already weathered a considerable amount of political attacks during this campaign season, and I expect most of his lightest support to have blown off during these attacks. His current support level is holding fairly steady.”  Another liberal publication, The Hill, reported that Moore was losing in the polls to Jones after the hit piece on Moore was published in the Washington Post.  The Hill -Democrat Doug Jones is leading Republican Roy Moore in Alabama’s Senate race in the wake of explosive accusations of sexual misconduct against Moore, according to a new poll released Sunday.  Forty-six percent of likely voters polled said they would vote for Jones, while 42 percent said they would vote for Moore, according to the Louisiana-based JMC Analytics and Polling.  The survey was conducted on Nov. 9 and Nov. 11, after The Washington Post reported that a woman said Moore had initiated a sexual encounter with her in 1979, when she was 14 years old and he was 32.  The RealClearPolitics poll has Moore and Jones tied.

1268,2867,11,2,2017,2017-11-02,Fox News,Judge Andrew Napolitano: Mueller's ultimate target is Trump. Here's what could happen next,"Earlier this week, the government revealed that a grand jury sitting in Washington, D.C., indicted a former Trump presidential campaign chairman and his former deputy and business partner for numerous felonies.  Both were accused of working as foreign agents and failing to report that status to the federal government, using shell corporations to launder income and obstruction of justice by lying to the federal government.  The financial crimes are alleged to have occurred from 2008 to 2014, and the obstruction charges from 2014 to 2017. At the same time it announced the above, the government revealed that a low-level former foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, George Papadopoulos, had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and become a government witness.  Does any of this relate to President Donald Trump? Here is the back story.  At the same time that Paul Manafort and his business partner Rick Gates were guiding the Trump campaign in the summer of 2016, Russian agents were manipulating American social media sites so as to arouse chaos in general and animosity toward Hillary Clinton in particular. The Department of Justice appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as independent counsel to determine whether any Americans had criminally helped the Russians.  The alleged crimes of Manafort and Gates appear to have nothing to do with Trump, nor have they any facial relationship to the Russians. So why were these two indicted by a grand jury hearing evidence about alleged American assistance to Russian interference with the 2016 presidential campaign?  When prosecutors confront a complex series of potentially criminal events, they often do not know at the outset of their investigation where the evidence will lead them. Sometimes they come upon a person who they believe has knowledge of facts they seek and that person declines to speak with them. Such a refusal to speak to the government is perfectly lawful in America, yet it often triggers a prosecution of the potential witness so that prosecutors may squeeze him -- not literally, of course -- for evidence to which they believe he can lead them.  The ultimate target of Mueller’s investigation is President Trump. It is standard operating procedure when prosecutors have a high-level target to charge those below the target with something just to get them to cooperate. Though the charges against Manafort and Gates need not be related to the Russians or to Trump, they must be real. It's clear they are, as each is facing more than 20 years in prison. Mueller believes that that prospect is enough to dispatch their lawyers to make deals with him.  The danger of such a deal is that Manafort and Gates may offer to tell Mueller what they think he wants to hear -- even if it is not truthful -- so that they can have their prison exposure lessened.  There is more danger in the seemingly smallest of this week’s Mueller-generated events. Papadopoulos was interviewed voluntarily by the FBI on Jan. 27. He was arrested on July 27 for lying to FBI agents during that interview. In a secret federal court proceeding on Oct. 5, he pleaded guilty.  In a profound miscarriage of justice, federal law permits FBI agents to lie to us but makes it a crime for us to lie to them. Nevertheless, why was the Papadopoulos guilty plea kept secret? What was he doing between his arrest and his plea and between his plea and its revelation?  Judges are very reluctant to close their courtroom doors in any criminal proceeding, even if both the prosecutors and the defense counsel request it. The public has a right to know whom the government is prosecuting and what deals or punishments it may be obtaining. Yet if prosecutors can convince a judge that public knowledge of the existence of a guilty plea might harm an ongoing criminal investigation, the judge can keep the plea secret.  That is apparently what happened here. It appears that Papadopoulos was gathering evidence for Mueller, probably by talking to his former Trump campaign colleagues while wired -- a process that would have been fruitless if his guilty plea had become public.  Because Papadopoulos admitted under oath that he lied to FBI agents, the courts will treat his guilt as certain. That gives Mueller great leverage with him. It also gives Papadopoulos great incentive to help Mueller -- truthfully or not -- because he knows he is going to federal prison. He also knows that if Mueller likes what he hears, a five-year prison term could be reduced to six months.  Hence, Papadopoulos could be a treasure-trove for Mueller on the production of any evidence linking the Trump campaign and the Russians and any evidence of Trump’s personal knowledge or acquiescence. Papadopoulos has already produced a wild tale about meetings with a Russian professor and a female Russian government agent in London that the FBI apparently believes.  Is this any way to conduct a prosecution?  I have argued for years that squeezing defendants and witnesses by threats and promises to get them to spill the beans is a form of extortion or bribery -- not much different from the extortion and bribery that the government regularly prosecutes. ""You tell us what we want to hear and we will ask a judge to go easy on you. If not, you will suffer great losses."" It is bad enough that the feds can legally lie to us and get away with it, but can they also legally threaten and bribe witnesses to testify against us and get away with it? Can they do this to the president?  In a word, yes. My arguments have fallen on deaf ears. Squeezing witnesses and defendants is a way of life for federal prosecutors. For the president, it is the tip of a dangerous iceberg.",3.25,6,"[0.5, 4.5, 2.5, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5]"

Roughly 1,000 individuals were invited to attend the speech, which will take place inside a hangar at an Air National Guard base and feature actual trucks surrounding the president. PennLlive.com reported.  The president is expected to use the platform to address his proposal of eliminating the estate tax, which he and some congressional Republicans claim will provide relief for small business owners, as the tax causes “hell” and forces them out of business, the Hill reported.  Trump also will likely introduce people in the crowd as living examples to illustrate his view that the estate tax negatively affects families, PennLive.com reported.  However, the Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation argues abolishing the estate tax, also known as the “death tax,” would mainly benefit the wealthy, as only 0.2 percent of Americans pay estate tax. One-percenters pay 27 percent of the total, the Hill reported.  Trump also will devote a significant portion of his speech to truckers, a “major beneficiary” of the tax plan, which proposes to lower the corporate tax rate to around 20 percent, although Trump hopes to see that number at 15 percent, a senior White House official told PennLive.com.  The tax alleviation would also allow manufacturers to spend more on production, thus providing truckers with more driving opportunities.  In addition, Republican lawmakers are also looking to reframe the current individual tax rate, from 39.6 percent to 35 percent, as well as simplify the complex tax code, and “deliver the lowest tax rates on businesses in modern history,"" Rep.

310,1645,10,5,2017,2017-10-05,Associated Press News,Equifax makes money by knowing a lot about you," This Saturday, July 21, 2012, file photo shows the corporate headquarters of Equifax Inc. in Atlanta. Equifax knows a lot about you. That, in essence, is how it makes money. The company and its competitors, Experian and TransUnion, make most of their money selling bulk lists to banks and credit card companies. (AP Photo/Mike Stewart, File)  NEW YORK (AP) — Equifax knows a lot about you. That is, in essence, how it makes money.  The company and its competitors have in their files the personal financial information of tens of millions of Americans like you, going back decades. Your mortgage loan totals. When you switched from a Macy’s card to a Target card. How much you still owe for college.  “It’s a pretty simple business model, actually. They gather as much information about you from lenders, aggregate it, and sell it back to them,” said Brett Horn, an industry analyst with Morningstar.  Equifax had more than $3.1 billion in revenue last year, largely from selling data to other companies. Experian’s revenue came to $4.34 billion, while TransUnion had $1.7 billion.  The trove of data — Equifax’s largest asset — has become its biggest liability after the company admitted that it didn’t keep the information safe from criminals who stole or accessed the data on 143 million Americans who are now at risk for identity theft. It’s now under investigation at the state and federal level, facing a series of lawsuits, and desperately trying to assuage the anger of the consumers who are its commodities.  What to know about how the credit companies work:  WHERE THE MONEY COMES FROM  Equifax, Experian and TransUnion make most of their money selling bulk lists to banks and credit card companies.  American Express, for example, could purchase a list of potential customers 25 to 30 years old with credit scores above 650. Armed with that, AmEx will send out pre-approved credit card mailers, hoping to sign up new customers.  Hundreds of millions of credit reports are sold this way each year to companies like Capital One, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup. Since the banks buy the reports in bulk, they pay as little as a few dollars per report. While people can get their credit reports once a year for free, Equifax charges $15.95 for the report plus a credit score, while Experian charges $19.95 for a report and score.  The credit bureaus also sell credit reports to potential employers. About 45 percent of companies with 2,500 to 24,999 employees do background credit checks on some job applicants, according to a 2012 study by the Society for Human Resource Management. While employers cannot get a person’s credit score, they can discover legal judgments or bankruptcies.  And there are products like fraud protection services and credit monitoring. Equifax normally sells a package of credit monitoring services for $19.95 a month. Experian is more involved in that market, but has gotten into some hot water. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau fined Experian $3 million in March for selling misleading credit scores to consumers.  Critics of the credit companies argue that Equifax could make some money off its own security failings. Its TrustedID product, which it is offering free for a year to people whose information was exposed, could retain some customers. LifeLock, another identity theft product, has also seen increased interest since the breach — but it buys its protection services from Equifax.  Finally, the company charges fees to customers who want to freeze or unfreeze their credit files. Those fees vary by state, and Equifax has waived them in the wake of the data breach.  HOW THE CIRCLE WORKS  The credit companies get information, such as whether you’ve paid your bills on time each month, largely for free.  An estimated 10,000 different companies and sources report information about you to Equifax, TransUnion and Experian, according to a 2012 study by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Industry experts say that figure could be as high as 30,000.  That information gets compiled into your individual credit report, pooled with data from banks to build a comprehensive picture of your financial history, and your potential financial risk.  Banks are just as reliant on the credit companies. Without the credit reports, a customer could default on a loan, then apply for another elsewhere without the new bank knowing the person’s history. The U.S. has thousands of individual lenders and banks, so very rarely could one bank offer a complete picture of a person’s financial history.  Often, banks make credit decisions based almost entirely on what they see in a credit report from these companies.  “They are the gatekeepers to whether you can get a credit card or an affordable car loan or a house,” said Chi Chi Wu, a longtime critic of the credit-reporting industry and a lawyer at the National Consumer Law Center.  THE ORIGIN OF CREDIT COMPANIES  Equifax, TransUnion and Experian are often referred to as credit bureaus or agencies, which lends them an official air. But they’re private companies without government affiliation.  How the companies got to hold information on so many millions of people in the first place is largely due to their position in a lightly regulated part of the U.S. financial system. The credit companies are governed by one main federal law, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which requires the companies to give you access to your data once a year and allow for disputes. Most of the regulation in the industry happens at the state level.  It’s also incredibly difficult to opt out of the system. You could live an all-cash lifestyle, never requesting credit from any bank, but still wind up with your information in the hands of the credit companies through less-obvious sources like cable or phone companies, property tax bills, or doctors’ offices.  Customers like this are known as “thin file” borrowers, because of the lack of information, but that doesn’t stop Equifax, Experian and TransUnion from building files on you. In these cases, the companies might only have a name, address, maybe a Social Security number — but that data could still be enough to start the process of identity theft.  ____  Ken Sweet covers banks and consumer financial issues for The Associated Press.

The ad asked whether President Donald Trump and Ed Gillespie would condone this behavior.  The ad also features footage from the alt-right’s “Unite the Right” rally in August, and the announcer asks, “Is this what Donald Trump and Ed Gillespie mean by the American dream?”  Leavitt attacked the Latino Victory Fund’s ad, arguing that it is an attack on all Virginians.  “This is not an attack on Ed Gillespie anymore,” said Chris Leavitt. “This is an all-out attack on the people of Virginia. This latest ad gives a clear indication of just what Ralph Northam and his national Democratic allies think of all of us, and it’s sickening.”  The Virginia Democrat gubernatorial campaign did not disavow the Latino Victory Fund’s attack ad on Gillespie and Trump supporters.  Northam spokeswoman Ofirah Yheskel admitted, “Independent groups are denouncing Ed Gillespie because he has run the most divisive, fear-mongering campaign in modern history. It is not shocking that communities of color are scared of what his Trump-like policy positions mean for them.”  Virginia Delegate Sam Rasoul, a Roanoke Democrat who argued that Democrats should not alienate Trump supporters, said that he disagrees with the ad, although, he contended, “the fear is real.”  “I would rather see groups use messages to inspire action, rather than fight fear with fear,” Rasoul added.  Gillespie’s campaign took a populist turn when he said that if elected governor, Gillespie would tackle the problem of MS-13 gangs in Northern Virginia and sign legislation to ban sanctuary cities. Democrats argued that banning sanctuary cities and protecting local Virginia communities from dangerous gangs such as MS-13 amount to racial stereotyping of immigrant communities.  Latino Victory Fund president, Cristobal Alex, argued that Gillespie “peddle[s] dangerous stereotypes” about immigrants.  Alex added, “We won’t take it any longer. It’s our moral imperative to stand up for Latino and immigrant families.”  Reports suggest that George Soros remains a significant funder of the Latino Victory Fund. Northam also gave a speech at a Latino Victory Fund reception in September.  Javier Gamboa, the Hispanic media director for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), endorsed the ad in a tweet on Monday, stating, “Powerful ad from @latinovictoryus.”  Breitbart News reported that the race between Gillespie and Northam remains tight.

Mr. Trump has established an easy rapport with “Chuck and Nancy,” as he likes to call Mr. Schumer, a fellow New Yorker, and Ms. Pelosi, of California. The three bonded last month over a dinner of honey sesame crispy beef in the White House, and their discussions have gone beyond the fiscal deal and how to protect young immigrants brought to this country illegally from being deported.  They have prodded Mr. Trump to put aside the Republican credo of “repeal and replace” in favor of more modest tweaks to the existing law. They have urged him to preserve subsidies, known as cost-sharing reductions, paid to insurers under the health law to help low-income consumers pay for out-of-pocket health expenses like co-payments and deductibles.  But Mr. Schumer’s quick rebuff of Mr. Trump on Friday shows the limits of the partnership. The senator has said that much will depend on whether the president keeps his promise to protect the young undocumented immigrants who are beneficiaries of the program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.  “Whether he pivots or not will be one of the most fundamental questions of this administration,” Mr. Schumer said recently. “It’s the $64,000 question. The only way it can happen is if we have a successful negotiation on DACA, and secondly whether we get health care.”  The president’s call is sure to further rankle Republicans, with whom Mr. Trump has had increasingly tense relations over their failure to knock down a key pillar of Mr. Obama’s legacy.

According to as study released on Monday, Oct. 23, 2017 by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the way a mother responds to her crying baby seems to be programmed into her brain circuits. Researchers found that mothers across many cultures tend to react the same way to an infant’s cry, and brain scans showed that this distressing sound activates circuitry associated with such responses. (AP Photo/Joerg Sarbach)  NEW YORK (AP) — Crying babies push the same “buttons” in their mothers’ brains no matter what their culture, a new study suggests.  The research found that mothers in 11 countries tend to react the same way to their bawling child — by picking up and talking to the baby — and that the way mothers respond seems to be programmed into their brain circuits.  An author of the study said he hopes the results will spur others to study brain responses in women who mistreat their children. Crying is a common trigger for abuse, said Marc Bornstein of the government’s National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, Maryland.  The new results were released Monday by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  The researchers analyzed videotapes of 684 mothers in 11 countries as they interacted with their infants, who were around 5 months old. The observations were done in Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Cameroon, France, Kenya, Israel, Italy, Japan, South Korea and the United States.  Analysis showed that the mothers were likely to respond to crying by picking up and talking to the infant. But they were not likely to use other responses such as kissing, distracting, feeding or burping the child. Results were similar across the various countries.  Next, researchers thought about what parts of the brain would likely be involved in the responses they saw. They focused on circuitry that’s activated when a person plans to do or say something, other circuitry that could be involved in figuring out the meaning of a cry and on brain parts known to play critical roles in maternal caregiving.  With brain scans, they found those brain areas were activated when 43 first-time mothers in the U.S. listened to recordings of their infants crying. Fifty mothers in China and Italy showed a similar result, with the Chinese moms showing different brain responses when they heard other sounds like infants laughing or babbling.  But brains of six Italian women who were not mothers reacted differently to crying, Bornstein said in an email.  “Mothers, based on their personal experience, could easily have their brains shaped in a matter of a few months to be especially sensitive” to an infant’s cry, perhaps because of hormonal changes that occur with parenting, he wrote.  In fact, one contribution of Bornstein’s work is that suggestion that brain development can continue beyond young adulthood, with motherhood as a key stimulus, commented Yale University researcher Linda Mayes, who did not participate in the study.  Helena Rutherford of Yale, who also did not participate in the study, said the brain findings make sense, and that the study was significant for showing consistency across cultures in those responses and the behavior of the mothers.  ___  Follow Malcolm Ritter at @MalcolmRitter His recent work can be found at http://tinyurl.com/RitterAP",3.9,15,"[2.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 1.5]"

Sean Copeland, 51, and his 11-year-old son Brodie were among the more than 80 people killed when a truck, whose driver was linked to Islamic State (ISIS), smashed through a crowd of people gathered last July for the Bastille Day fireworks along a popular promenade. The father and son were in Europe on vacation with Sean’s wife, Kim, and his two other children from a previous marriage.  “Kim Copeland is filing this lawsuit hoping that there will be no more funerals where ISIS and others continue to conduct terrorist operations using social media as a tool,” Keith Altman, one of the lawyer’s representing Kim Copeland, told Fox News in an email. “She also wants to see Google, Facebook, and Twitter change their behaviors and act reasonably and responsibly by taking active steps to disrupt ISIS and other nefarious groups’ ability to use their sites to cause death and destruction.”  The complaint, filed Thursday in the northern district of California, argues that the three Silicon Valley-based companies “have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds, and attracting new recruits.”  “Without Defendants Twitter, Facebook, and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible,” the complaint states.  Copeland’s lawsuit is just the latest in a series of legal actions leveled against the three tech companies by Altman on behalf of the families of terror attack victims.  Earlier this month, the family of California man killed in August’s terror attack in Barcelona filled suit against Google, Facebook and Twitter and, in June, Altman brought a case against the companies on behalf of a Jordanian citizen killed in the New Year's Eve terror attack by ISIS at an Istanbul nightclub that left 39 dead.  To date, Altman has leveled seven lawsuits against the three tech giants – alleging that Google, Facebook and Twitter have allowed their social media platforms to be used as a tool to recruit jihadists and that these companies have even profited from advertisements on terrorist propaganda.  Altman and others have begun to argue that social media sites may be violating the provision with their heavily guarded algorithms and that these companies have the resources to monitor any terror activity on their platforms.  “I want to show that there is no social benefit to letting terrorists use social media,” Altman said.",3.3214285714285716,14,"[4.5, 5.0, 3.0, 3.5, 3.5, 2.5, 4.5, 4.5, 0.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.0, 4.5, 0.5]"

(AP Photo/Cliff Owen)  Democrats swept Virginia and New Jersey’s governor’s races, incumbents came out on top in several big-city mayoral races and voters in Maine said they wanted to join 31 other states in expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.  A rundown of the top races around the country on Tuesday:  TWO GOVERNORS  Voters in two states picked replacements for their term-limited governors — Democrat Terry McAuliffe in Virginia and Republican Chris Christie in New Jersey — in contests seen as an early referendum on the presidency of Donald Trump. In swing state Virginia, Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie. In New Jersey, front-running Democrat Phil Murphy overcame Republican Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno.  The stakes were high as both parties sought momentum ahead of next year’s midterm elections. Democrats haven’t won any special elections for Congress this year and the next Virginia governor will have a major say in the state’s next round of redistricting, when Congressional lines are drawn. Republicans were looking for a boost as their party is beset by intraparty turmoil between Trump and key Republicans in Congress.  Seattle voters will elect their first female mayor since 1926 on election day, with two female candidates vying for the office. One analyst says it signals a trend for women winning mayoral seats in Washington state. (Nov. 7)  BIG-CITY MAYORS  Democrat Bill de Blasio won a second term as mayor of heavily Democratic New York City. He easily defeated Republican state lawmaker Nicole Malliotakis and several third-party candidates.  In Boston, Mayor Marty Walsh won a second four-year term by beating City Councilor Tito Jackson after a low-key campaign.  Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan won a second four-year term by defeating state Sen. Coleman Young II, whose father was the city’s first black mayor. Duggan was first elected after a state-appointed manager filed for Detroit’s historic bankruptcy.  Two Atlanta city councilwomen, Keisha Lance Bottoms and Mary Norwood, were the top two vote-getters in the city’s mayoral race from a field of nearly a dozen candidates and are now headed to a Dec. 5 runoff. The winner will replace term-limited Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed.  In Seattle, former U.S. Attorney Jenny Durkan took a strong early lead in the race for mayor. Voters were choosing between Durkan and urban planner Cary Moon to replace former Mayor Ed Murray, who resigned earlier this year amid sexual abuse allegations. Ballot counting in the all mail-in election will continue over the next several days.  Charlotte, North Carolina, is getting its sixth mayor since 2009. Mayor Pro Tem Vi Lyles, a Democrat, beat Republican City Councilman Kenny Smith.  MEDICAID  Maine voters approved a measure allowing them to join 31 other states in expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. The referendum represented the first time since the signature health bill of former President Barack Obama took effect that the question of expansion was put before U.S. voters. Maine’s Republican governor had vetoed five attempts to expand the program.  UTAH’S CONGRESSIONAL SEAT  The Republican mayor of the Mormon stronghold of Provo, Utah, won a special election to replace U.S. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who resigned earlier this year. In an expected victory in the heavily Republican congressional district, John Curtis beat Democrat Kathryn Allen and third-party candidate Jim Bennett.

All five living former U.S. presidents joined to support a Texas concert raising money for relief efforts from Hurricane Harvey, Irma and Maria's devastation in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. (AP Photo/LM Otero)  AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — The five living former presidents put aside politics and appeared together for the first time since 2013 at a concert on Saturday to raise money for victims of devastating hurricanes in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  Democrats Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter and Republicans George H.W. and George W. Bush gathered in College Station, Texas, home of Texas A&M University, to try to unite the country after the storms.  Texas A&M is home to the presidential library of the elder Bush. At 93, he has a form of Parkinson’s disease and appeared in a wheelchair at the event. His wife, Barbara, and George W. Bush’s wife, Laura, were in the audience.  Grammy award winner Lady Gaga made a surprise appearance at the concert that also featured country music band Alabama, Rock & Roll Hall of Famer ‘Soul Man’ Sam Moore, gospel legend Yolanda Adams and Texas musicians Lyle Lovett and Robert Earl Keen.  The appeal backed by the ex-presidents has raised $31 million since it began on Sept. 7, said Jim McGrath, spokesman for George H.W. Bush.  President Donald Trump offered a video greeting that avoided his past criticism of the former presidents and called them “some of America’s finest public servants.”  “This wonderful effort reminds us that we truly are one nation under God, all unified by our values and devotion to one another,” Trump said in the greeting, played during the concert.  Four of the five former presidents — Obama, George W. Bush, Carter and Clinton — made brief remarks that did not mention Trump. The elder Bush did not speak but smiled and waved to the crowd. They appealed for national unity to help those hurt by the hurricanes.  “The heart of America, without regard to race or religion or political party, is greater than our problems,” said Clinton.  The last time the five were together was in 2013, when Obama was still in office, at the dedication of George W. Bush’s presidential library in Dallas.  There is precedent for former presidents joining forces for post-disaster fundraising. George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton raised money together after the 2004 South Asia tsunami and Hurricane Katrina the next year. Clinton and George W. Bush combined to seek donations after Haiti’s 2011 earthquake.  “It’s certainly a triple, if not a home run, every time,” said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor at the University of Houston. “Presidents have the most powerful and prolific fundraising base of any politician in the world. When they send out a call for help, especially on something that’s not political, they can rake in big money.”  Amid criticism that his administration was initially slow to aid ravaged Puerto Rico, Trump accused island leaders of “poor leadership,” and later tweeted that, “Electric and all infrastructure was disaster before hurricanes” while saying that Federal Emergency Management Agency, first-responders and military personnel wouldn’t be able to stay there forever.  But Rottinghaus said ex-presidents are seen as less polarizing than the current president.  “They can’t get away from the politics of the moment,” he said of current White House occupants. “Ex-presidents are able to step back and be seen as the nation’s grandfather.”  Hurricane Harvey slammed into Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast as a Category 4 hurricane on Aug. 25, unleashing historic flooding in Houston and killing more than 80 people. Shortly thereafter, all five ex-presidents appeared in a commercial for a fundraising effort known as “One America Appeal.” In it, George W. Bush says, “People are hurting down here.” His father, George H.W. Bush, then replies, “We love you, Texas.”  Hurricane Irma subsequently hit Florida and Hurricane Maria battered Puerto Rico, while both devastated the U.S. Virgin Islands.

So even the dictators or the hereditary dictators were being overthrown and then whoever was more favorable to the federal police, who wore dark blue robes -- this is where the police blue comes from -- the Praetorian Guard. Whoever was favorable with them and some of the main legions that were obviously exploratory to the empire, they would overthrow the patricians. They would overthrow the gentry class.

360,1701,10,5,2017,2017-10-05,Vox,Hurricane Nate forecast to hit the Gulf Coast: what we know,"Atlantic hurricane season, which has already broken a few records, isn’t over. And indeed, there’s another one.  Early Saturday, Tropical Storm Nate intensified into hurricane as it moved over the warm Gulf of Mexico. Hurricane Nate is now sustaining 85 mph winds, making it a Category 1 storm. It’s forecast to make landfall with 90 mph winds near the Louisiana-Mississippi border Saturday night.  A hurricane warning — meaning hurricane conditions are imminent — is in effect for the coastline between Grand Isle, Louisiana, and the Alabama-Florida border. This area includes New Orleans.  Nate is moving very quickly northward at around 22 mph, so it won’t linger long over these areas. But the forecast is calling for 4 to 6 feet of “life threatening” coastal storm surge, 3 to 6 inches of rain, and damaging winds. Both the governors of Louisiana and Mississippi have proclaimed states of emergency to hasten preparations.  On Friday, New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu ordered mandatory evacuations for certain low-lying sections of the city, and ordered a 7 pm curfew Saturday. Nate will test the resiliency of New Orleans pumping stations, which are operating at 92 percent capacity after being strained by previous flooding this summer, The New Orleans Advocate explains. With Nate, the city is expected to see up to 10 inches of rain. ""We are ready for whatever Nate brings our way,"" Landrieu told reporters Friday.  St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana, which sits on edge of the low-lying Mississippi Delta just south of New Orleans, has ordered evacuations as early as Thursday. (As Weather Underground explains, St. Bernard Parish “has the horrific distinction of being the only parish or county completely inundated from Katrina.”)  Nate has already been a deadly storm  Earlier in the week, Tropical Storm Nate made landfall over Nicaragua and Honduras with 40 mph winds, bringing 15 to 20 inches of rain. It’s expected to continue northward, clipping the Yucatan Peninsula, and then head through the Gulf of Mexico, where it’s likely to hit warm patches of water that will help it intensify into a hurricane. According to the Associated Press, Nate has been responsible for 22 deaths in Central America, mainly due to flooding.  Here are the latest key messages on the storm, from the National Hurricane Center:  1. Life-threatening storm surge flooding is likely along portions of the northern Gulf Coast, and a storm surge warning is in effect from Morgan City, Louisiana, to the Okaloosa/Walton county line in Florida. Residents in these areas should heed any evacuation instructions given by local officials. 2. A hurricane warning is in effect for portions of the northern Gulf Coast from Louisiana to Alabama, and preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion in these areas. 3. Nate will bring heavy rainfall of 3 to 6 inches with isolated totals of 10 inches east of the Mississippi River from the central Gulf Coast into the Deep South, eastern Tennessee Valley, and southern Appalachians through Monday, resulting in the potential for flash flooding in these areas. 4. Moisture from Nate interacting with a frontal zone will also bring 2 to 4 inches with isolated totals of 6 inches across the Ohio Valley into the central Appalachians Sunday into Monday, which will also increase the risk for flash flooding across these locations.  Don’t just focus on wind speed. Even if Nate doesn’t become a hurricane, it’s still packing a lot of rain.  Nate will be the fourth hurricane to make landfall on the US this season. And that’s concerning because the federal government’s emergency response capabilities are already severely strained from the ongoing disaster response in the aftermath of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. These were all extreme rainfall events that caused billions of dollars’ worth of damaged and cost hundreds of lives. The Federal Emergency Management Agency and other agencies are still trying to save lives in Puerto Rico. Needless to say, another storm — especially one impacting Louisiana, parts of which were affected by Harvey — is not good news.  A Category 1 storm with 85 mph winds can damage homes, uproot trees, and knock out power. But meteorologists caution against focusing on wind speed alone. As we saw with Harvey in Houston, even a hurricane that’s downgraded to a tropical storm can cause massive destruction and chaos. Even if Nate remains a tropical storm, it can still dump feet of rain in an area, which can quickly overwhelm drainage systems, causing flash flooding and mudslides. And it’s often costal storm surge — not winds — that are the deadliest aspect of a hurricane.  How to follow Nate",3.875,4,"[3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.0]"

The Independent reports that the British government is nearly certain that North Korea was behind the WannaCry ransomware hack that massively affected NHS IT systems in May of this year. According to a report released by the National Audit Office on Friday, hospital networks were left vulnerable to the attack as basic cybersecurity measures had not been implemented. Appearing on the BBC Today programme, British Security Minister Ben Wallace asserted that British government now believes that a North Korean hacking group is responsible for the ransomware attack.  “This attack, we believe quite strongly that this came from a foreign state,” Mr. Wallace said. Saying that the state involved was “North Korea”, he added, “We can be as sure as possible. I obviously can’t go into the detail of intelligence, but it is widely believed in the community and across a number of countries that North Korea had taken this role.”  When asked what steps the British government could take in the situation, Wallace replied that it would be “challenging” to arrest anyone responsible for the hack when a “hostile state” such as North Korea is involved. Wallace called on countries in the West to develop a “doctrine of deterrent” similar to the nuclear deterrent employed by most countries.  “We do have a counterattack capability,” said Wallace. “But let’s remember we are an open liberal democracy with a large reliance on IT systems. We will obviously have a different risk appetite. If you get into it for that there has to be serious consideration of the risk we would expose UK citizens to.”  According to the NAO’s investigation, approximately 19,500 medical appointments, including 139 potential cancer referrals, were canceled as a result of the WannaCry attack, with five hospitals being forced to divert ambulances away after they were unable to access computers. The report also states that NHS Digital, the IT body that monitors the hospital’s computer systems, issued alerts throughout March and April warning the NHS that they must update and patch their systems in order to protect themselves from hackers and viruses.  Keith McNeil, chief clinical information officer for health and care at NHS England, commented on the hack saying, “No harm was caused to patients and there were no incidents of patient data being compromised or stolen. Tried and tested emergency plans were activated quickly and our hard-working NHS staff went the extra mile to provide patient care, keeping the impact on NHS services and patients to a minimum.”  Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, said “The WannaCry cyber attack had potentially serious implications for the NHS and its ability to provide care to patients. It was a relatively unsophisticated attack and could have been prevented by the NHS following basic IT security best practice.” Morse continued,  “There are more sophisticated cyber threats out there than WannaCry so the department and the NHS need to get their act together to ensure the NHS is better protected against future attacks.”",3.0833333333333335,6,"[1.5, 4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 2.5, 1.5]"
725,2139,10,17,2017,2017-10-17,Fox News,US looking to Japan for help in boosting LNG exports to Asia,"The U.S. is keen to work with Japan in expanding exports of U.S. liquefied natural gas in Asia, and hopes for more Japanese investment in American natural gas infrastructure, a senior Department of Energy official said Wednesday.  Japan's trade and industry minister announced Wednesday plans for a $10 billion public-private effort to build LNG terminals, power plants and other facilities to help meet rising energy demand in Asia.  ""The global demand for liquefied natural gas is rising sharply and the expansionary trend will continue for a while, mainly in Asia,"" Hiroshige Seko, ministry of the economy, trade and industry, told a conference in Tokyo.  Seko also said Japan hoped to build a market for price setting of LNG, long an issue of concern for the world's largest importer of natural gas. Japan's imports soared after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami along its northeastern coast triggered meltdowns that led to the shutdowns of all its nuclear reactors. Only a few have been restarted.  U.S. Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette, who is visiting Tokyo, described Japan's plan to support investments in LNG facilities as ""fantastic.""  ""I thanked Minister Seko personally for that announcement today,"" he said. ""We see Japan not only as a customer but a valued partner and investor in our infrastructure.""  Many of the fastest growing markets in the Asian-Pacific region lack terminals and other infrastructure needed to increase their LNG imports.  Exports of natural gas from the U.S. were restricted for decades but such limits have loosened and the Trump administration is pushing for increased energy exports.  Japan has been importing LNG from Alaska since 1969. But the first international shipment of liquefied natural gas in decades from the Lower 48 states was shipped to Brazil from Louisiana just last year.

Like what you’re reading? Sign up to get VoxCare in your inbox here.  Ever since it was announced, the future of the bipartisan deal from Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) and Patty Murray (D-WA) to stabilize Obamacare has gotten muddier.  As a matter of policy, the deal (explained in more detail here) provides some clear wins for both sides. Obamacare's cost-sharing reductions are paid, after President Donald Trump pulled them, a win for Democrats who want the law to work. On the Republican side, states will get more flexibility and consumers get some more insurance options.  But this is Obamacare we're talking about. After years of partisan warfare, a sensible compromise isn't going to just sell itself.  The picture got a little clearer, at least in the Senate, on Thursday. Alexander and Murray announced 24 co-sponsors for their bill, 12 from each party.  The 48 Senate Democrats were always likely to support the deal. It's had no bigger cheerleader than Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.  The majority is the real question. Right now, 12 of the 52 Republican senators are willing to put their name on Alexander-Murray (Alexander plus these 11):  Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD)  Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC)  Sen. John McCain (R-AZ)  Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA)  Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME)  Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA)  Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK)  Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC)  Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN)  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-GA)  Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA)  That's a start, made up mostly of the more moderate end of the GOP conference.  But it means Republican supporters still have work to do. While the bill probably has the 60 votes it needs with Democrats united behind it, it's hard to imagine GOP leaders putting a bill on the Senate floor that only 12 of their own members support.  Alexander made his pitch clear in a floor speech today: People will be hurt without action, Republicans already included cost-sharing payments in their repeal-and-replace bills, and Alexander-Murray represents an actual policy win for Republicans after repeal's failure.  ""Some say that’s not enough,"" he said. ""Well, that’s more than we’ve gotten in eight years.""  Though Alexander will undoubtedly do his best, many — maybe most — Republicans won't willingly vote for a standalone bill that fixes Obamacare after they spent nine painful months trying to repeal it.  Noting that there seemed to be 40 votes in the Senate for any repeal bill, a GOP health care lobbyist told me: ""The same herd mentality there puts you at a deep hole in the Senate"" on Alexander-Murray.  Instead, Democrats are likely going to have to force the issue.  We should reset our expectations: The deal almost certainly won't pass on its own. So let's look ahead to December, when the federal government needs to be funded.  ""That’s your place that Republicans can more comfortably let it move,"" the lobbyist said.  Government spending bills need 60 votes, so the minority has a lot of leverage. But Alexander-Murray won't be the only thing they want. Democrats are also eager to resolve the DACA issue, after Trump said he would end that protection for certain undocumented immigrants.  Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi are going to try to get everything they can in a shutdown deal — and they have a proven record of winning Trump to their side.  But if this should become a tit-for-tat negotiation, the question will be where Alexander-Murray ranks among the Democratic priorities. It will be competing with DACA and, potentially, the Children's Health Insurance Program, which is heading into its third week without being reauthorized. Trump will want something (the ""wall""?) in return.  This is going to be messy. And then you have the House, where Speaker Paul Ryan has already tried to pour cold water on the deal. He could end up being squeezed the most if Alexander-Murray gets folded as expected into the end-of-the-year talks.  ""It sucks being Paul Ryan,"" the lobbyist said ""What I can’t figure out is how he gets out of December without 150 Republicans against something.""  So we know how Alexander-Murray could pass:  Democrats make it a must in the shutdown negotiations  Alexander gathers enough Republican supporters to make it palatable in the Senate  Ryan accepts it as a necessity in the House to keep the government open  Trump stays on board, after his waffling over the past few days  But that is a road filled with landmines. It's going to be an interesting two months for the deal.  vox-mark VoxCare Vox's email explaining the biggest news in health care, edited by Sarah Kliff Subscribe By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy.

Researchers in Mexico were thrilled to have captured one of the few remaining vaquita porpoises on Saturday, Nov. 4, but the adult female died after a few hours in captivity in a floating pen, raising questions about the last-ditch effort to enclose the world's smallest porpoises to save them from extinction. (AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell, File)  MEXICO CITY (AP) — Researchers were thrilled to have captured one of the few remaining vaquita porpoises, but announced Sunday that the adult female died after a few hours in captivity in a floating pen, raising questions about the last-ditch effort to enclose the world’s smallest porpoises to save them from extinction.  Critics, and even supporters of the international rescue effort, knew the plan was full of risks: The small marine mammals native to Mexico’s Gulf of California have never been held in captivity, much less bred there.  But with estimates of the remaining population falling below 30, the international team of experts known as Vaquita CPR felt they had no choice. In late October, researchers captured a vaquita calf but quickly freed it because it was showing signs of stress and was too young to survive without its mother.  On Saturday, the team felt its luck had turned when it caught a female in reproductive age. Mexico’s environment secretary, Rafael Pacchiano, tweeted a photo of the vaquita in a net sling late Saturday, saying: “This is a great achievement that fills us with hope.”  The vaquita was taken to a protected floating pen in the Gulf of California in the hopes that it would survive, and possibly breed if more vaquitas could be captured.  But on Sunday, the team said, “Veterinarians monitoring the vaquita’s health noticed the animal’s condition began to deteriorate and made the determination to release.”  “The release attempt was unsuccessful and life-saving measures were administered,” the team wrote. “Despite the heroic efforts of the veterinary team, the vaquita did not survive.”  “The entire rescue team is heartbroken by this devastating loss” wrote the team, which is using U.S. Navy-trained dolphins to help find the elusive species in the upper Gulf of California, also known as the Sea of Cortez. “The risk of losing a vaquita during field operations was always acknowledged as a possibility, but it was determined that it was unacceptable to stand by and watch the vaquita porpoise disappear without a heroic attempt at rescue.”  If it proves impossible to safely capture vaquitas, experts say an all-out effort will be needed to save them in their natural habitat. Vaquita populations have been decimated by illegal nets used to catch totoaba fish, whose swim bladder is prized in China.  “We are deeply saddened to learn that the vaquita captured on Saturday has died. We are confident that the experts involved in the capture did their best,” said Alejandro Olivera, the Mexico representative for the Center for Biological Diversity. “However, this should be a reminder for the Mexican government that ‘Plan A’ should never be forgotten. To truly protect these incredible little porpoises, the Mexican government must once and for all get deadly gillnets out of the vaquita’s habitat.”  Mexico has moved to ban gillnet fishing in the area, mounted a campaign to confiscate nets, and is trying to stop illegal fishing. But given the enormously high prices that totoaba swim bladders fetch on the black market, fishermen have used go-fast boats and stealth tactics that are hard to stop.  The environmental protection unit of the federal Attorney General’s Office said Sunday that authorities had seized four miles (6.4 kilometers) of nets, 5 metric tons of shrimp, and one shrimp boat as part of enforcement efforts in the second half of October. Authorities also seized three smaller boats and four vehicles.",3.3333333333333335,3,"[3.0, 3.5, 3.5]"

U.S. stocks are quiet early Wednesday, Aug. 30, 2017, as technology companies rise while energy companies continue to fall as investors sort through the ongoing damage caused by Harvey. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)  LONDON (AP) — Upbeat economic figures from around the world helped shore up global stock markets on Thursday ahead of a raft of U.S. data that could determine the scale of upcoming rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.  KEEPING SCORE: In Europe, Germany’s DAX rose 0.6 percent to 12,072 while Britain’s FTSE 100 advanced 0.7 percent to 7,419. The CAC 40 in France was 0.7 percent higher too at 5,091. U.S. stocks were poised for a steady opening with Dow futures and the broader S&P 500 futures up 0.2 percent.  US DATA: Following jitters at the start of the week over North Korea’s firing of a missile over Japan, the mood has improved somewhat with most investors monitoring a raft of economic data that culminates with Friday’s U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for August. That could help shape market expectations over the pace of interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.  ANALYST TAKE: “Of course, Friday’s jobs report is widely regarding as the most important data release each month due to the insight it offers on hiring, wages and therefore potential future inflation pressures,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA. “Today’s data though is arguably equally important, if not more so at the moment, as it contains the latest inflation numbers — as per the Fed’s preferred measure — as well as income and spending figures.”  EUROZONE INFLATION: Inflation across the 19-country eurozone struck a four-month high of 1.5 percent in the year to August largely because of higher energy costs, in a development that’s unlikely to alter expectations that the European Central Bank will play it safe at next week’s policy meeting. The increase was anticipated in financial markets, but inflation remains below the European Central Bank’s goal of just below 2 percent.  CHINA MANUFACTURING: An official gauge of Chinese factory activity improved for a 13th straight month in August. The preliminary version of the purchasing managers’ index from the China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing and the National Bureau of Statistics rose to 51.7 from July’s 51.4 on a 100-point scale on which numbers above 50 show activity expanding. An index of new orders rose to 53.1 from July’s 52.8.  ASIA’S DAY: The Shanghai Composite Index was unchanged at 3,360.81 while Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.7 percent to 19,646.24. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng shed 0.4 percent to 27,970.30 and Seoul’s Kospi lost 0.4 percent to 2,363.19. Sydney’s S&P-ASX 200 advanced 0.8 percent to 5,714.50.

1568,3237,11,8,2017,2017-11-08,Vox,“Climate change” and “global warming” are disappearing from government websites,"After a year of the Trump administration, one of the most distinctive changes we’ve seen across the government is the removal of language around climate change on government websites.  It’s happened not just at agencies that deal directly with the issue like the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy, but also at the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health and Human Services.  While largely superficial, these changes in wording are symptomatic of broader shifts of the Trump era occurring within federal agencies that are trying to boost fossil fuels and roll back efforts to study, mitigate, and adapt to climate change.  The Environmental Data & Governance Initiative, a watchdog group, has been tracking many of these deletions. And this week it reported that the removal of “climate change” and related terms as well as entire pages on the issue could have a real impact on policy. For instance, they note that EPA’s removal of the website describing Obama’s signature climate policy, the Clean Power Plan, could influence the administration’s efforts to repeal it.  “The removal of the EPA’s Clean Power Plan website in advance of the Plan’s proposed repeal, obscuring compiled state emission policy information from those interested in researching the Plan, is one example of how democratic policymaking is undermined,” the authors wrote.  In some cases, the removal of references to climate change is a political directive from new Trump appointees — what some scientists have described as censorship. In other cases, agency staffers are tweaking program names and language in internal documents to try to stay out of the crosshairs of their new bosses. In other words, out of sight, out of mind, and maybe out of range for budget cuts.  For instance, EDGI found that the DOE Energy Information Administration’s Energy Kids page was altered to play up fossil fuels and play down climate change, while the EPA’s “Student’s Guide to Climate Change” was unlinked from its main page and buried on its site. A separate report from EDGI released Wednesday showed that the section on climate change was removed from the Bureau of Land Management’s website.  Though there doesn’t seem to be a systematic effort to delete “climate change” and “global warming” from all government websites, programs, or internal documents, interviews with agency staffers and watchdogs combined with news reports suggest it keeps happening. For its part, EDGI says it doesn’t “assess​ ​any​ ​agency​ ​or​ ​entity’s​ ​intentions​ ​or​ ​rationale​ ​for​ ​the​ ​demonstrated​ ​changes​.” Here’s a list — that’s by no means exhaustive — broken down by agency.  Department of Energy  In June 2017, the agency closed down its Office of International Climate and Technology, the only division with the word “climate” in its name. But before it closed, agency staff were trying to change the office’s name to protect it. ""It is absolutely true that prior to inauguration but after the election, the Office of International Climate Change Policy and Technology was seeking to change its name to remove 'climate,'"" Graham Pugh, a career staffer who led the office until 2014, told E&E News. ""The drill is you change 'climate change' to 'competitiveness.'""  Jennifer Bowen, an associate professor at Northeastern University, reported in August that she was asked to remove the words “global warming” and “climate change” from a research grant application she submitted to the Energy Department. Officials have denied that there is any policy banning the use of these phrases.  The Trump transition team in December 2016 sent and then disavowed a questionnaire to the US Department of Energy asking for names of personnel who attended international climate discussions.  A career staffer told This American Life’s David Kestenbaum that she and other workers went through internal documents shortly after the election to reframe justifications for programs from climate change to “weather” and “jobs.”  Department of Health and Human Services  The Environmental Data and Governance Initiative, which is monitoring government websites, reported in August that the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, which is part of the US Department of Health and Human Services, removed language on climate change from a webpage.  The institute “altered​ ​climate change​ ​language,​ ​updated​ ​climate​ ​change​ ​references,​ ​and​ ​reduced​ ​access​ ​to​ ​a​ ​Web resource​ ​with​ ​information​ ​on​ ​climate​ ​change​ ​and​ ​human​ ​health​ ​across​ ​several webpages,” the EDGI found.  Department of Transportation  In February 2017, the Federal Highway Administration renamed its ""Sustainable Transport and Climate Change"" team the ""Sustainable Transportation and Resilience"" team.  A spokesperson told E&E News that ""the team name was changed to more accurately reflect our emphasis on our resilience activities which constitute a large portion of our portfolio of work.""  Environmental Protection Agency  In April 2017, the Environmental Protection Agency announced website changes to remove “outdated language” and noted that “content related to climate and regulation is also being reviewed.” The words “climate” and “climate change” were then removed from EPA websites, such as those for state, local, and tribal governments.  “We are constantly updating our website to reflect new initiatives and projects of the Agency,” an EPA spokesperson wrote in an email. “Of course the site will be reflective of the current administration’s priorities — with that said, all the content from the previous administration is still easily accessible and publicly available through the banner across the top of the main page of the site.”  EPA scientists reported in October that they were blocked without explanation from attending a conference to present their work on climate change.  “It’s definitely a blatant example of the scientific censorship we all suspected was going to start being enforced at EPA,” John King, a professor of oceanography at the University of Rhode Island, told the New York Times.  An EPA staffer who asked not to be named tells Vox that language in internal documents describing a program’s work on “climate change” was changed to “climate resiliency” to protect the program from potential politically motivated cuts.  Department of the Interior  A group of scientists reported in May 2017 that the US Department of the Interior objected to climate change references in a news release about a study they published on coastal flooding.  “While we were approving the news release, they had an issue with one or two of the lines,” Sean Vitousek, a research assistant professor at the University of Illinois Chicago, told the Washington Post. “It had to do with climate change and sea-level rise.”  In October 2017, a scientist at Interior who worked on climate change resigned and filed a whistleblower complaint. Joel Clement, who studied the impact of rising seas on Native American tribes, was involuntarily reassigned to a division that collects royalties from fossil fuel leases.  ""They are clearly not going to address the climate change issue at all there and my voice is far more useful outside the agency than in it,"" Clement told CNN. ""I'm not shocked. I'm discouraged. This kind of thing is not surprising anymore and I guess that's the most discouraging thing about it, it was a clear pattern.""  Department of Agriculture  Another example we saw in Michael Lewis’s article in Vanity Fair last year was Brian Klippenstein, who led the Trump transition team for the USDA, gunning for people working on climate change as soon as he arrived.  Klippenstein previous ran a group called Protect the Harvest, which lobbies against groups like the Humane Society and raises awareness about “threats posed by animal rights groups and anti-farming extremists.”  “He came in and wanted to know all about the office on climate change,” a former USDA employee told Lewis. “That’s what he wanted to focus on. He wanted the names of the people doing the work.”  Agency staffers declined to give up names and tried to stay out of the spotlight by changing how they framed their work, as shown in an email signaling changes in messaging.  The email exchange, first obtained by the Guardian, provided guidance for how officials should rebrand their work. “Soil carbon sequestration” was to be reframed as “building organic matter in the soil to improve soil health,” for example.  The removals are pretty minor, but they reflect a broader change in attitude toward climate  It’s difficult to tell how many of these changes stem from self-preservation among career staff in government versus directives from political operatives, but for the latter, there doesn’t seem to be a strategy behind the changes.  It’s not a way to insulate the agencies from litigation, for example, since they are held to their obligations in statutes, not what’s written on their websites.  “I think it’s much more of a 1984-ish thought control motivation,” said David Doniger, director of climate and clean air program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “They don’t want the EPA website to pop up when middle school and high school kids are doing their research on climate change.”  Researcher Victoria Herrmann also reported in March that Arctic data sets and policy documents were being deleted from government websites.  “Each defunct page is an effort by the Trump administration to deliberately undermine our ability to make good policy decisions by limiting access to scientific evidence,” she wrote at the Guardian.  Many agencies still retain robust information on climate change science and policy. But leaders are ignoring it.  The removals listed here are most likely a patchwork attempt to remove inconvenient references to climate change that contradict the policies of the Trump administration. But it’s not hard to find plenty of language that still acknowledges humanity’s impact on the climate and the imperative to combat it.  Go to the DOE site and you will find this: “Addressing the effects of climate change is a top priority of the Energy Department. As global temperatures rise, wildfires, drought, and high electricity demand put stress on the nation’s energy infrastructure.”  Though the EPA’s climate change landing page is down for updates, it still maintains a website for climate change indicators like storms, wildfires, and rising temperatures.  “Many of these observed changes are linked to the rising levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in our atmosphere, caused by human activities,” the website reads.  And yet executive branch officials have shown they are quite capable of ignoring their own agencies’ high-quality science.  EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, for example, told USA Today that he would not change course in undoing greenhouse gas regulations in the Clean Power Plan despite the White House’s release last year of the Climate Science Special Report, which found that “human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming.”  The report received input from 13 federal agencies, including the EPA, the DOE, Interior, and Transportation.  ""Does this report have any bearing on that? No it doesn’t,” Pruitt said. “It doesn’t impact the withdrawal and it doesn’t impact the replacement.""  Similarly, Kathleen Hartnett White, who was renominated to lead the White House’s Council on Environmental Quality, told lawmakers at her confirmation hearing that the climate assessment wouldn’t guide any of her work.",4.333333333333333,3,"[4.5, 4.5, 4.0]"
326,1662,10,4,2017,2017-10-04,Breitbart,UC Riverside Student Presses Charges over Alleged Theft of MAGA Hat,"UC Riverside student Matthew Vitale is pressing charges against one of his peers, Edith Macias, for allegedly stealing his “Make America Great Again” hat off of his head.  A video of Vitale’s exchange with Macias went viral on Facebook, racking up over 2 million views in the first few days after it was posted. On October 2, Vitale claimed that Facebook removed his viral video.  The alleged thief, Ethnic Studies major Edith Macias, accused Vitale of endorsing “genocide” by wearing the hat. “So this guy thought it would be a good idea to go into a conference wearing this f***ing hat,” Macias says in the video. “Look at the kind of sh*t he’s wearing, You know what this represents? This represents genocide—genocide of a bunch of people.”  Now, Vitale is pressing charges. After campus police informed Vitale that Macias’ allegedly stealing his hat would constitute a felony theft charge because she took it off of his head, he decided to take a stand.  “I do want to send a message,” Vitale explained. “I am not vindictive, I am not vengeful, but people especially in my generation need to realize you can’t do things like this because you don’t like what someone is saying or wearing.”  Vitale, who stated in the video he is half-Nicaraguan, rejects Macias’ claims that wearing the hat amounts to a form of hate speech.  “Free speech is under attack on campus,” Vitale argued. “As cliche as it sounds, the facts of our laws and our Constitution … don’t care about what you feel. For millennials everywhere who believe their feelings give them the right to step on the rights of others — you are sadly misguided. That is not the real world.”  In response to Vitale’s video going viral, the university released a statement reaffirming their commitment to free speech. “Coequal to our dedication to mutual respect is our commitment to free speech and the free exchange of ideas,” the message read. “A university requires an environment where students and scholars can freely express ideas and pursue knowledge, while also promoting respectful dialogue among individuals or groups with opposing viewpoints.”",0.5,2,"[0.5, 0.5]"

Behar suggested that Eminem was being brave because literally no one in Hollywood or the music industry has taken such a stand, “That’s why you need to give him [Eminem] credit because very few people in the industry will go out and say, ‘I don’t care if you don’t support me. This is more important than, than my popularity.’ I have never seen it, frankly.” Really Joy? What planet have you been living on for the past 2 years?  Co-host Sonny Hostin told the adoring liberal crowd, “I was actually at the hair salon watching the BET awards and the salon just um, roared when that happened.” She went on to condemn Trump for using Twitter and other means of communication to express his conservative views and then told the excessively liberal panel that, “I just thought it was very brave.”  Trending: DIRTY POLITICS: LEAKED AUDIO Exposes Attempted Cover-Up Of Dem Leader’s Sponsorship Of Bussed In Protesters  That’s when Meghan McCain, who appeared to be silently seething, as she listened to these morons speak to viewers as though they’re speaking to an audience who’s been living on an alternate planet, or don’t have any access to real news finally spoke up, saying, “Actually, It’s more socially acceptable to be a liberal in Hollywood.”    Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?

Huh? Whoopi then doubled down and suggested in her condescending tone that a simple trip to Amazon to purchase a few books should help Meghan to understand the history of Hollywood, that of course, only Whoopi truly understands. Whoopi then embarrassed herself again when she tried to prove how many conservatives are working in Hollywood. The first example she used was comedian Tim Allen, whose top-rated show, “Last Man Standing” was just clearly canceled by ABC for political reasons. Whoopi then attempted to think of a second conservative actor and stumbled to finally land on Tom Selleck who hasn’t acted in a major movie or television show for decades. Selleck’s career peaked in the 1990’s. Outside of his occasional appearances on “Friends” as Monica’s boyfriend, Selleck’s career has been almost non-existent.  Meghan tried to explain to the panel that liberals are treated horribly in Hollywood and that it’s more socially acceptable to be a liberal in Hollywood than a conservative. She said that she lived in Los Angeles and that she was never more harassed than when she was living there. Meghan told that cast that it’s more popular to be an Obama and Hillary, and even Bernie supporter.  Whoopi then embarrassed herself again, when she tried to convince the panel that Meghan’s assertion that conservatives are blacklisted in Hollywood is ridiculous. Whoopi laughed and corrected McCain saying, ‘Except that all of the conservatives in Hollywood are working. They’re the ones that are working.” She tried to recall some examples of conservatives working in Hollywood. The first example she used was comedian Tim Allen, whose top-rated show, “Last Man Standing” was recently canceled by ABC for his political views. Whoopi then attempted to think of a second conservative actor and stumbled to finally land on Tom Selleck. Wow, 2 conservatives in Hollywood!

The business and its labor practices are under investigation by Brazilian authorities, just one of several inquiries launched into a pair of Brazilian churches connected to Word of Faith Fellowship, a secretive evangelical sect based in Spindale, North Carolina. (AP Photo/Andre Penner)  RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Every day before work, Liliane Souza says, she and three dozen fellow workers at a Brazilian picture-framing factory affiliated with the Word of Faith Fellowship church were obligated to pray.  When workers made a mistake, such as cutting a frame too short, she says they were screamed at and sometimes even hit to expunge the “devil” behind the error. And when Stylofino stopped paying its workers for months, Souza said the company’s co-owners — members of a Brazilian branch of the U.S.-based church — had a ready explanation.  “They said the business was struggling because we were sinners,” she said.  The business and its labor practices are under investigation by Brazilian authorities — just one of several inquiries launched into a pair of churches connected to Word of Faith Fellowship, a secretive evangelical sect based in Spindale, North Carolina.  The Associated Press has learned that Brazilian prosecutors also are looking into possible improprieties in a land deal involving one of the churches. And education ministries in two Brazilian states said they are investigating allegations that church schools physically and psychologically abused students and redacted textbooks in violation of state policy.  The investigations were spurred by AP stories in July detailing allegations that Word of Faith Fellowship created a pipeline of young congregants who say they were brought to the U.S. from Brazil and forced to work at church-affiliated businesses for little or no pay. The stories also documented how the church steadily took over the two Brazilian congregations, instituting a fundamentalist vision that included verbal and physical abuse aimed at expelling devils.  Pastors at the Word of Faith Fellowship branches — located in the Brazilian cities of Sao Joaquim de Bicas and Franco da Rocha — have issued statements denying the accusations, but did not respond to numerous interview requests from the AP.  After the stories about the Brazilian churches were published in July, authorities in both Brazil and the United States launched investigations into the allegations of abuse, forced labor and visa fraud. Investigators told the AP that interviews stemming from that ongoing probe led them to scrutinize the conditions at Stylofino.  The small factory in the Sao Paulo suburb of Franco da Rocha was opened in 2000 by Gerson Jose Garcia and Juarez de Souza Oliveira, according to tax records.  De Souza Oliveira and wife Solange Granieri founded Ministerio Evangelico Comunidade Rhema, or Rhema Community Evangelical Ministry, in 1988. Garcia is a long-time member of the church, which includes an adjoining school.  Eight former factory workers interviewed by the AP described a rigid working environment that mirrored the religious fervor of the church and school. Only members of the church could work there: Leaving the church meant leaving the job.  The employees said they were paid minimum wage and worked most national holidays, late at night and on weekends, but never were paid overtime. They were pressured into signing falsified time sheets that reflected vacations never taken and only the limited hours they were supposed to be working, they said.  They also said they were not provided lunch stipends or allowed to sell a portion of their holidays for pay, both of which are mandated by Brazilian law.  Three of the former workers said they began part time while in high school, working off the books as “volunteers” for no compensation.  Andre Oliveira said he started at the factory in 2007 while still in high school and continued into 2009 about eight months after graduating, working almost every day from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. for no pay.  “I never received even a cent,” said Oliviera, who broke with the church last year and now lives in the United States.  He said he feared that refusing to work would have led to being kicked out of church or “blasting,” a practice in which followers surround a congregant and scream, often for hours.  The workers told the AP that, beginning in 2011, many employees were not paid their regular salaries for more than a year, instead receiving payments months late or just a portion of what they were owed. Employees who complained or said they needed money to pay bills were more likely to get paid, the former members said.  They said the owners blamed the suspension of salaries on the factory having money problems due to workers sinning. Prayer increased, they said, and anybody who questioned what was going on was subjected to blasting.  “They would say, ’A demon took you over! You are out of your mind!” said a former worker who left the church and factory in 2012 and recently gave testimony to federal police. The worker asked not to be identified because of relatives still in the church.  Inside the factory, “They would put you in a chair and people would pray for you. They would shake you, hit you in the face,” the worker said.  Requests for comment left at the home of Granieri and de Souza Oliveira, on Garcia’s cellphone and via Stylofino’s website were not returned.  On Aug. 3, federal police and labor investigators from Brazil’s Justice Department raided the church and school in Franco da Rocha, gathering records and beginning a series of interviews, an official who was not authorized to speak publicly and insisted on anonymity told the AP. The official said that investigators also visited Stylofino the same day, conducting interviews and gathering records.  A woman who answered the phone at Stylofino said the business no longer operated as a factory, but declined to answer further questions. Repeated knocks on the factory door were not answered, and a “for rent” sign was posted outside.  In the course of interviews, former members also told investigators about a deal in which church leaders in the Franco da Rocha branch ended up with ownership of land that initially had been bought in the church’s name. Police inspector Felipe Carbonari confirmed to the AP that an investigation was under way but would provide no details.  The church and school sit adjacent on a large plot that backs up onto a street, with a high fence blocking any outside view. In 1999, the church bought two adjoining parcels for 47,000 reales (then $24,700), according to records reviewed by the AP.  The land was bought with money saved by the congregation over three years by the usual tithing of 10 percent and a number of targeted fundraisers, according to six former long-time members who broke with the church in the past year.  The plan was to build a pastoral home that would house the church leadership and serve as a center of activities, a common practice among Brazilian churches, they said. A home on one of the plots was renovated and Granieri and de Souza Oliveira live there today.  In 2006, the pastors themselves also became the properties’ legal owners, with a seven-member board set up to manage the land, documents show. The records show Granieri was named president and de Souza Oliveira vice president, with four of the remaining board slots filled out by the couple’s relatives.  The former members interviewed by the AP said they were furious when they learned of the property transfers only this year.  “We all worked to buy those lands,” said Flavio Correa, who left the church last year after 25 years and recently provided testimony to investigators. “When you see something like this with people you trusted, it’s like the world is crashing around you.”  Meanwhile, education agencies in both states with Word of Faith Fellowship branches have launched investigations into the churches’ schools.  In its July stories, the AP reported that students were sometimes subjected to the same harsh treatment that church members received, ranging from blasting to sustained isolation. The stories also detailed how textbooks ranging from life sciences to geography were heavily redacted. For example, a photo of a woman applying makeup in a social sciences book was covered completely, as were the genitals of a man in an anatomy book.  Inspectors have found several cases of censorship that violated school regulations and also infringed on authors’ intellectual rights, according to Webster Silvino de Oliveira, the school superintendent whose district includes Sao Joaquim de Bicas.  De Oliveira said the district would initially look to “correct and monitor” the situation without issuing fines or revoking the school’s license, and that accusations of abuse would be passed on to law enforcement. He declined to discuss specifics of anything found to date.  The superintendent overseeing the school in Franco da Rocha did not respond to interview requests.  Allegations of abuse in the schools are widespread among former members.  Maria Reis said her now 15-year-old son was frequently screamed at and segregated from other students because he had trouble learning. She pulled her son from the school last year and left the church in Franco da Rocha after being a follower for 23 years.  Reis said her decision to break with Word of Faith Fellowship came after she broached the school issue with church founder Jane Whaley, who was visiting Brazil for a wedding.  ″‘You are a rebel. You are going against God,’” Reis recalled Whaley telling her. “I came to the conclusion there was no gospel in this church. The objective was just to control people.”  ____  Associated Press reporter Stan Lehman in Franco da Rocha contributed to this report.  ____  Follow Peter Prengaman: twitter.com/peterprengaman",2.933333333333333,60,"[4.0, 1.0, 5.0, 2.5, 4.5, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 2.0, 5.0, 3.5, 2.5, 2.0, 2.5, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 1.5, 2.5, 0.5, 5.0, 0.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5, 0.5, 1.5, 4.0, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 5.0, 1.5, 0.5, 3.0, 0.5, 4.5, 0.5, 5.0, 2.5, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 3.0, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.5, 2.5, 1.5, 2.5, 1.5]"
517,1907,10,12,2017,2017-10-12,Fox News,NAFTA's future remains unclear as talks continue,"Few clues emerged from President Donald Trump’s meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday about the uncertain future of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).  ""We're negotiating a NAFTA deal. It's time after all of these years and we'll see what happens. It's possible we won't be able to make a deal and it's possible that we will,"" Trump said.  Negotiations have struggled to gain momentum as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce cautioned that the Trump administration’s impractical requests could harm the talks.  But despite the U.S. threatening to withdraw from the agreement that’s been in effect since 1994, Trudeau remained optimistic that the U.S., Canada and Mexico can reach a ""win-win-win"" solution. Still, he said Canada would be ""ready for anything.""  The fourth round of NAFTA negotiations began Wednesday in Arlington, Va., and will continue through Tuesday.  NAFTA eliminated trade barriers between the U.S., Canada and Mexico to generate trade growth. But critics argue it also led to the downfall of U.S. manufacturing as companies moved across the southern border to take advantage of cheaper labor.  In order for the tri-lateral trade agreement to remain past its 23rd year, Trump has requested an increase in U.S auto production, more American companies securing government contracts in the NAFTA bloc, and for the agreement to be abolished altogether unless countries agree every few years to extend it. In addition, the administration is seeking eliminating dispute resolution processes.  Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue detailed some of the main issues with NAFTA, specifically where Canada is reaping more of the benefits than the U.S.  “The irritants that we have are primarily with Canada over their dairy management supply program. They are overproducing, creating depressing world prices for milk solids,” Perdue told FOX Business’ Trish Regan on The Intelligence Report. “There is also a wine issue in British Columbia where they are not letting our wines out front where their customers can choose.”  Perdue added that there are also issues with poultry access.  U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Thomas Donohue called Trump’s proposals “poison pills” for Canada and Mexico, which could result in the death of the agreement, Reuters reported.  Donohue co-chaired the U.S.-Mexico CEO conference Wednesday alongside Fedex Freight's CEO Michael Ducker. Guillermo Vogel, a steel company executive, co-chaired the event in Mexico, which included closed-door talks regarding NAFTA with Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray and Economy Minister Idelfonso Guajardo, who are responsible for Mexico’s involvement in the negotiations, Reuters reported.  Vogel emphasized the importance of negotiating a good deal, and told Reuters a “bad agreement” would be far worse than “with no NAFTA,” but recognized the end of the pact would be a “lose-lose” situation.  Farm groups and agricultural lobbies have urged the Trump administration to keep NAFTA, because if the U.S. were to leave the agreement, the agricultural industry would be slapped with potentially steep tariffs from Canada and Mexico.  If negotiations fail to reach a solution, Trump alluded to the possibility of having separate deals with Canada and Mexico.  “It's possible we won't be able to reach a deal with one or the other. But in the meantime, we'll make a deal with one,"" the president said.  In addition, during an interview with Forbes magazine published Tuesday, Trump appeared to favor eliminating the deal and said he likes “bilateral deals.""  ""I happen to think that NAFTA will have to be terminated if we're going to make it good. Otherwise, I believe you can't negotiate a good deal,"" Trump said.  Trudeau will head to Mexico on Thursday to continue talks regarding NAFTA.

53,286,7,5,2017,2017-07-05,Vox,Car companies' vision of a gradual transition to self-driving cars has a big problem,"aiAn important moment in the self-diving car debate came on May 7, 2016, when Joshua Brown lost his life after his Tesla vehicle crashed into a semi-truck trailer. Brown had engaged Tesla’s Autopilot feature, and the software didn’t detect the white side of the trailer against the daytime sky. The car slammed into the truck at full speed — 74 miles per hour — shearing off the top of the car and killing Brown.  The accident — characterized by many as the first of self-driving car accident — caught the attention of the National Transportation Safety Board, which released hundreds of pages of new details about the incident last month.  But the industry that’s trying to make self-driving a reality takes exception with this characterization. Tesla argued that autopilot is not a self-driving technology, but more like an advanced form of cruise control. Drivers need to keep hands on the wheel and their eyes on the road at all times when Autopilot is engaged, the company says. Computer logs released by the NTSB last month show that Brown’s car warned him seven times to keep his hands on the wheel. Each time, Brown put his hands on the wheel for a few seconds — long enough to make the warnings go away — before taking them off again.  In January, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration sided with Tesla in the case, concluding that the Autopilot system wasn’t defective. “Not all systems can do all things,” said agency spokesman Bryan Thomas. “There are driving scenarios that automatic emergency braking systems are not designed to address.”  Still, Brown’s death illustrates one of the biggest challenges carmakers will face as they work to bring self-driving cars to market. Most car companies envision a gradual path to self-driving capabilities, selling cars with increasingly sophisticated driver-assistance features over several years before ultimately introducing fully self-driving cars with no pedals or steering wheel.  But there’s a danger that people will trust the technology too quickly, as Brown did. After hundreds or even thousands of miles of flawless driving, people could stop paying attention to the road, with deadly consequences. Industry’s answers to what makes driverless cars safer to drive reveal a lot about how we already drive — and how easy it us to become dependent on a new technology.  Partially self-driving cars are going to nag drivers constantly  Tesla’s approach to self-driving — one the company has doubled down on since Brown’s death — is for cars with partial self-driving capabilities to pester drivers to pay attention to the road.  Earlier this month, I visited Tesla’s Palo Alto headquarters for my own test drive of the Model S. Before she let me drive the car on my own, a Tesla employee gave me a lecture where she emphasized that Autopilot is not a full self-driving system. She pointed out that before enabling the Autopilot feature for the first time, drivers must read and accept a disclaimer, displayed on the 17-inch screen in Tesla’s center console, that stresses the need to keep hands on the wheel at all times.  And this isn’t just an idle suggestion. The Model S had sensors that that allowed it to detect if I had my hands on the steering wheel. If I didn’t, the dashboard would eventually begin to flash until I put my hands back on the wheel.  Joshua Brown’s Tesla gave him these warnings too — seven of them — but he didn’t pay enough attention to them. Since his death, Tesla has established a stricter “three strikes and you’re out” rule: If the driver ignores three consecutive warnings, he gets locked out of Autopilot for the rest of that trip. If the driver still doesn’t grab the wheel, the car will assume the driver is incapacitated and come to a gradual stop with the hazard lights flashing.  Other car companies are working on similar technologies. Audi, for example, will soon be introducing a product called traffic jam pilot that will allow hands-free freeway driving up to 35 miles per hour (self-driving at full highway speeds is four to five years away, Audi says). During a recent test drive, Audi engineer Kaushik Raghu told me that Traffic Jam Pilot will include a “driver-availability monitoring system” that makes sure the driver isn’t sleeping or looking backward for an extended period of time.  Cadillac recently announced a freeway-driving technology called Super Cruise that does this. An infrared camera mounted in the steering wheel can tell if the driver is looking out at the road or down at a smartphone. If the driver’s eyes are off the road for too long, the car will start beeping until the driver gets his eyes back on the road.  I got an idea of what this might look like when I visited Nauto, a startup that is developing sophisticated driver-monitoring technology. Nauto makes a windshield-mounted device that looks back at the driver and can tell if the driver isn’t looking at the road. If integrated into a self-driving car — or a conventional car, for that matter — this kind of technology could prevent a lot of distracted driving and highway deaths.  Of course, plenty of people drive regular cars without their hands on the wheel, meaning that driver-assistance cars could ironically wind up asking drivers to pay more attention than their all-human-driven counterparts.  Why almost-perfect autopilot can be dangerous  Chris Urmson, who led the team of Google’s self-driving car engineers until he left to found his own startup last year, describes the decision over whether to assist drivers or take the drivers out of the equation as “one of the big open debates in the space.”  Google — which recently renamed its self-driving car project Waymo — has been thinking about this problem for years. Back in 2014, Google self-driving car engineer Nathaniel Fairfield gave a talk at a computer vision conference describing how Google had built self-driving technology for freeway driving, then decided that the approach was too dangerous. Waymo customers will never be allowed to touch the steering wheel on its cars.  Early versions of Google’s self-driving car technology worked a lot like Tesla’s Autopilot or the Audi prototype I rode in a few weeks ago. The driver would be responsible for navigating surface streets at the beginning and end of a trip, but would be able to activate self-driving mode during freeway driving. Clearly marked roads and a lack of pedestrians and other obstacles make freeway driving a relatively easy computer science problem.  The problem, Fairfield said, was that people started trusting the system too quickly. “People have this curve where they go from somewhat unreasonable but plausible distrust to way, way overconfidence,” Fairfield said. After a few hours of seeing Google’s freeway driving technology in action, people came to have “complete and utter trust” in its efficacy.  “In-car cameras recorded employees climbing into the back seat, climbing out of an open car window, and even smooching while the car was in motion,” John Markoff reported in the New York Times.  A technology that drives perfectly for 100 or even 1,000 miles might still make a catastrophic mistake once in a while. But after mile after mile of flawless driving, it’s unlikely the driver will be paying close attention to the road. Which means that if the car suddenly encounters a problem it can’t handle, handing off control to the human driver could make things worse rather than better.  This is a problem that the aviation industry has grappled with for decades. In 2009, Air France flight 447 crashed into the ocean on the way from Rio de Janeiro to Paris. The problem: ice on the plane’s sensors caused the autopilot to disengage. The pilot, with little experience handling the plane without computer assistance, did exactly the wrong thing, pitching the plane’s nose up when they should have pushed it down. The plane stalled, and the resulting crash killed all 228 people on board.  “It’s clear that automation played a role in this accident, though there is some disagreement about what kind of role it played,” a 2015 Slate article on the crash argues. “Maybe it was a badly designed system that confused the pilots, or maybe years of depending on automation had left the pilots unprepared to take over the controls.”  This is the paradox of automated systems: The better an autopilot system is, the more human beings will come to depend on it and the worse-prepared they’ll be if they’re forced to suddenly take over control.  It’s easy to imagine something similar happening with self-driving cars — especially to younger drivers. As driver assistance technologies become more common, there will be a growing cohort of teenage drivers who have never driven without computer assistance. But if these cars are designed to fall back on a human driver in unexpected situations, there’s a danger that human drivers won’t be prepared, and will do exactly the wrong thing at a life-or-death moment.  And the closer self-driving cars get to full autonomy, the harder it will be to get drivers to pay attention. Even if cars can force drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and their eyes on the road, they might still zone out if they don’t have to actually make any decisions for thousands of miles in a row. Beyond a certain point, it might become safer for the car to just make its best guess about what to do rather than turn over control to a driver who is likely to be disoriented and out of practice.  Waymo wants to jump straight to full self-driving  Google ultimately concluded that partially self-driving cars were a technological dead end. Instead, the company set itself a goal to build a fully self-driving vehicle — one that was so reliable it would never need intervention from a human driver.  Urmson, the former Google engineer, believes that driver assistance and full self-driving are “actually two distinct technologies.”  “In a driver-assistance system, most of the time it’s better to do nothing than to do something,” Urmson said in an April talk. “Only when you’re really, really, really sure that you’re going to prevent a bad event, that’s when you should trigger. That will guide you down a selection of technologies that will limit your ability to bridge over to the other side.”  In contrast, Waymo is trying to build cars that never hand off control to a human passenger. That means the software has to be able to choose a reasonable, safe response to every conceivable situation. And it means building in redundancies so that the car can respond gracefully even if key components fail.  “Each of our self-driving vehicles is equipped with a secondary computer to act as a backup in the rare event that the primary computer goes offline,” Google wrote in a 2016 report. “Its sole responsibility is to monitor the main computer and, if needed, safely pull over or come to a complete stop. It can even account for things like not stopping in the middle of an intersection where it could cause a hazard to other drivers.”  Building software that can gracefully handle any contingency — and redundant, bulletproof hardware — is a much harder technical problem than building driver-assistance technology that counts on humans to handle tricky situations. But it also has a big upside: If the car never transfers control to a human driver, then it never has to worry about the driver being caught unprepared.  For now, Waymo does still have drivers behind the wheel, but these drivers are Waymo employees with special training on handling self-driving vehicles, who are presumably paid to continue paying attention to the road no matter how boring it gets. And in recent months, the job has been getting pretty boring. According to a regulatory filing, Waymo’s self-driving cars drove more than 600,000 miles in California and only had to hand over control to a human driver 124 times.  That works out to one disengagement every 5,000 miles, a four-fold improvement over 2015, and by far the best showing of any company testing on California roads. At that rate of progress, it’ll take a few more years for Waymo to surpass human levels of driving safety. If the California data is any indication, rivals like GM, Ford, BMW, and Mercedes have a lot of catching up to do.  While Waymo seems to be the clear leader in self-driving technology right now, the company is taking a big risk by trying to jump straight to full self-driving technology. Reaching the necessarily level of reliability — going from 99.99 percent reliability to 99.9999 percent, say — might take several more years. During that time, companies taking a gradualist approach could steadily gain ground.  One big advantage of the gradualist approach is that it can allow car companies to collect a lot of data, and many experts believe that having a lot of data is crucial for building successful self-driving cars. Waymo’s cars have driven more than 3 million miles on public road, providing the company with the raw data they use to tune their software algorithms. in contrast, Tesla has collected more than 1 billion miles of real-world sensor data from its customers’ cars. All that extra data could allow Tesla to make more rapid progress toward a goal of full autonomy, allowing it to eventually catch and surpass Waymo’s early lead.  Disclosure: My brother works at Google.  Correction: My article initially said the Air France flight 447 crash was caused by pilots being disoriented in the seconds after the autopilot disengaged. But it’s more accurate to say the crash occurred because they were inexperienced at handling the plane without computer assistance. I’ve modified the article accordingly.

Like what you’re reading? Sign up to get VoxCare in your inbox here.  President Trump signed an executive order that could — emphasis on could — do substantial damage to the Obamacare marketplaces.  Trump's order sets out two goals with major consequences for the insurance market, if they come to pass:  Make it easier to set up association health plans and for those plans to be considered part of the large-group market  Expand the definition of ""short-term limited-duration insurance"" from three months to nearly a year  If you want the full wonky breakdown, I wrote about the order and its potential effects on the Affordable Care Act here. But this is the gist: The White House wants to make it easier for people to buy cheaper and skimpier coverage that doesn't comply with the Affordable Care Act's rules.  vox-mark VoxCare Vox's email explaining the biggest news in health care, edited by Sarah Kliff Subscribe By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy. For more newsletters, check out our newsletters page  The risk, according to health policy experts, is that young and healthier people will flock to this skimpier coverage, making the Obamacare markets older and sicker. That is going to drive up premiums for people still buying coverage through the health care law.  But Trump's pen isn't magic. The executive order doesn't actually do anything on its own. Which is confusing! In fact, a lot about the executive order is hard to decipher.  Here are some of the big questions, and my best attempts to answer them.  1) When does this actually go into effect?  Trump has technically asked federal agencies to consider issuing new regulations that achieve the executive order's goals. That's all.  Federal rulemaking takes some time, months upon months. Senior administration officials told reporters today that they didn't expect any changes to be made before the end of the year.  2) Which Obamacare regulations are actually being targeted?  This answer comes in two buckets.  For association health plans: If they can be considered large-group plans, they no longer have to comply with Obamacare's requirement that they cover certain essential health benefits. Large employers are exempt from that rule, which is limited to individual and small-group plans.  For short-term insurance: These plans are completely free from the ACA's regulations. Carriers can deny people coverage based on their medical history, charge people higher premiums based on their health status, and limit their benefits significantly more than the health care law allows.  3) Can individuals buy into association health plans?  This is maybe the biggest question. Experts generally agree that if individuals are allowed to join the association plans, the impact on the Obamacare marketplaces will be much more severe.  The executive order itself seems to limit the plans to businesses. But administration officials, in their call with reporters, indicated that they will look at whether they can allow self-employed people to buy into these associations.  ""That is both a legal and policy question,"" one official said, adding it was ""potentially possible"" to allow those people to join associations.  4) Will this coverage be considered compliant with the individual mandate?  This is another issue with huge consequences. The one deterrent for people absconding to these skimpy plans, particularly the short-term insurance, is that they could still be subject to the individual mandate because the plan doesn't qualify as minimal coverage.  But if that changes, people would have even more incentive to abandon Obamacare and buy these skimpier plans, which would further damage the law's markets.  In the call with reporters, administration officials were coy. They simply noted that the executive order didn't address what is considered minimal coverage. They did point out that large-group coverage, which is what many association plans may soon be considered, is generally found to satisfy the mandate.  Any further changes to that threshold, particularly if the Trump administration makes short-term coverage compliant, would be a game changer.  5) What can states do?  We won't know until we see the regulations how much the traditional state authority to regulate association health plans and short-term insurance will be preempted. But experts are watching closely.  If states still have significant oversight, they could — if they so chose — potentially do a lot to limit people migrating to these skimpier plans.  But the Trump administration may try to write the new rules to handcuff states as much as possible.  6) Can these changes be challenged in court?

Feminists think Starbucks has a special drink that’s racist and they’re going after the coffee house because of it. No, we didn’t make this up. Just listen to Tucker Carlson’s dismay at how ridiculous this is:  Trending: AMERICA’S BIGGEST LOSER Explains Why Multiple Sexual Assault Claims Against Bill Clinton Are Not As Serious As Kavanaugh’s…Calls For CIVIL WAR! [VIDEO]  WEIRDEST CLAIM EVER: PUMPKIN SPICE LATTE = WHITE SUPREMACY:    Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court? Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?  Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court? * Yes, he will be confirmed. No, he will not be confirmed.  Email *  Email      “Pumpkin spice just doesn’t taste as good when you add a shot of racism,” a feminist leader explained as the fall flavor began to pop up in coffee shops around the country. This is a shockingly weird claim, but it shouldn’t be surprising.  In an editorial published last month, we wrote about the Left’s effort to broaden the boundaries of concepts such as white supremacy and racism in a way that impugns the conduct of well-meaning people. Now, a feminist nonprofit is running a campaign to convince festive imbibers of Pumpkin Spice Lattes they’re unknowingly boosting the cause of white supremacy.  The co-founder of UltraViolet issued the “shot of racism” statement Sept. 6. I knew Starbucks had a secret menu, but the baristas must really be keeping these racism shots on the down low.  A social media post from the group informed readers: “That favorite fall drink of yours is funding rent payments to white supremacy.”  Given the severity of the campaign’s language, one may assume profits from sales of Starbucks’ beloved PSLs are being surreptitiously redirected to the Klan or neo-Nazi groups. In fact, UltraViolet’s actual complaint is that a couple of Starbucks’ 24,000 locations happen to be in properties owned by the Trump Organization.  According to UltraViolet’s logic, by patronizing any of Starbucks’ thousands of stores, average consumers of the signature fall beverage are directly boosting the cause of white supremacy. How increased latte profits to the Trump Organization (not even the White House) impact the president’s policies on racial matters is left unclear.

695,2104,10,17,2017,2017-10-17,Vox,"It’s time to weaponize the ""whisper network”","“Hey, just so you know, don’t be alone with X.”  “I know you’re new here. In case nobody has mentioned it, Y has raped women. That’s a fact.”  “I’d call Z a creep, but I don’t think he’s dangerous in the way W is. I don’t know, I could be wrong.”  These are the kinds of warnings whispered in private among women in work spaces. They are spoken at the bar with other women; they appear in my email inbox or my Twitter DMs. This is the whisper network that exists, informally, among women who want to protect themselves and other women from sexual harassment.  It’s a phenomenon that has been part of the public conversation of the past few weeks. The publication of a New York Times investigation detailing Harvey Weinstein’s decades of alleged sexual harassment set off a whirlwind of chatter among women about the widespread sexual harassment, sexual assault, and rape that exists not only in entertainment and media, but across other industries.  This news has brought to the surface the private conversations women have been having — the warnings whispered to each other to avoid getting hurt. As women have written in the past few days, these whisper networks are a lifeline. And as a 25-year-old woman new to both working in media and living in New York, I mean that literally: They have helped keep me safe. But a concern keeps gnawing at my conscience, and I don’t have an answer: What about the women who don’t get this information?  They are the women who are the most likely targets of abuse: not socially well networked with other women, young, new to these industries, naive, alone. When we rely on whisper networks, we ensure that these women won’t be privy to this information, and we — the women who rely on these networks — would be lying if we pretended we don’t know that some of these women will become victims. It’s not a question of if, but when.  So having acknowledged that, what can we do?  An anonymous spreadsheet of dangerous men was a flawed but important attempt  Last Wednesday, some women in media put forward one answer to this question.  On my commute home from work, I got a message from a female friend that said, “In case you haven’t been shared on this,” followed by link to a Google spreadsheet.  This spreadsheet contained a list of men in media and allegations of inappropriate behavior against them. The list, titled “SHITTY MEDIA MEN,” could be edited anonymously by anyone with access to it. While a couple of the allegations were minor — “creepy af in the dms” comes to mind — most were serious, with rape, sexual assault, sexual harassment, and physical violence littering the “alleged misconduct” column. They added up to a warning: Be careful; don't be alone with this man; if you can avoid taking a job with him, do so. A man I am close with was on the list: When I read the allegations against him, it felt like the ground was falling out from beneath me. It still does.  The existence of the list was reported by BuzzFeed less than 24 hours after the creation of the document. After the story was picked up by other outlets, the list quickly went offline. Many women have criticized BuzzFeed’s decision to publish a story on a document never intended to be public. The document was a flawed but understandable attempt to make the whisper network more concrete — and in doing so, to democratize it. Considering that the women who don’t have access to the private whisper network are the women most likely to be targeted by abusers, the document was a laudable effort driven by women’s collective impulse to protect one another.  But Shitty Media Men was also disastrous in some ways. No mechanism to verify the allegations had been developed — and no chance for a large number of women to weigh in. Still, the speed at which it spread spoke to a voracious hunger among women in media to do something, even a flawed something, to stamp out sexual harassment and assault in our industry.  The informal whisper network needs to be formalized  Two days before the spreadsheet was created, an accomplished female journalist wrote to me asking a question posed repeatedly since the news of the secret list broke.  “What would it mean to formalize the whisper network and use it to take power rather than to accept men's power and do the added work of working around it?” she asked.  She cited a recent story by Anne Helen Petersen about whisper networks as a “means of survival,” as well as an essay I wrote for Jacobin recently about workplace sexual harassment. She then raised the question: Are we normalizing a system in which it is left to women to do the significant labor of spreading this information, and avoiding sexual predators? As Petersen writes, “We’ve become dependent on unofficial modes of communication to protect ourselves.” So how do we shift the labor required to protect ourselves onto our industries themselves — onto the people and institutions with the money and power?  As a grassroots effort to resolve a political problem, whisper networks clearly fall into the category of political organizing. But they are resolutely on the informal end of the spectrum. They are far from frivolous; they’re unambiguously political. But how do we expand and institutionalize these networks, moving them closer to the formal end of tactics?  Rallying cries that men need to do their part by speaking up feels insufficient, to say the least. Call me a cynic, but most men will not act upon knowledge about sexual harassment until we have weaponized these networks. Nor do I trust HR departments, loyal to the company above all else, to adequately investigate allegations against the men who hold power in that company. We need entities with teeth that can bring real consequences to bear on men who we know are abusive.  We also cannot rely on powerful women to speak out against dangerous men. It’s no coincidence that Ashley Judd was initially one of the few women who spoke about Weinstein’s behavior on the record. Her career is stable enough to allow her space to speak out without fear of destroying her job prospects. That the stories in the Shitty Media Men document were anonymous shows that many women still believe the consequences of going public about harassment are too high. And these women in US media, as white-collar workers, have more room than, say, low-wage or undocumented workers to come forward.  Collective action is the best way forward  So, again, what do we do? If this were an issue within one workplace, one answer is to unionize, and to use the union as a third party — not beholden to the company — through which to collectively stamp out harassment or assault. When a victim comes forward with an accusation through a union, she has the legal expertise of the union on her side, as well as the institutionalized collective power of her co-workers.  Of course, unions aren’t a cure-all. At least one actress who says she was harassed by Harvey Weinstein, Mia Kirshner, has written about why she did not trust her unions — the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and the Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television, and Radio Artists (ACTRA) — to forcefully deal with the issues. Kirshner pointed out that the SAG union will typically ask the studio or production house to investigate any alleged abuse internally if a worker reports harassment to the union. “You can imagine its effectiveness,” she writes. “Especially when the person being investigated runs or owns the studio.”  Kirshner also proposed changes that the unions could institute, suggesting that a harassment complaint should trigger a third-party independent investigation, for instance, and that unions should ban one-on-one meetings in hotel rooms. Rather than give up on unions, we should strengthen them.  But this is a cross-workplace issue, so unions may not be enough. We work for different companies, and sometimes in different industries entirely. This complicates our ability to place demands on any one employer. If whisper networks operate at the level of the social world of women, whatever the industry, then we can take the next step toward building the power of these networks.  We saw one example in the Shitty Media Men spreadsheet. But while false reporting is far from common, the ability to input an allegation anonymously and online runs the risk of declaring men guilty without verification. This in turn tars all the allegations with an uncertainty that stops us from acting on them. Further, the whisper network, formalized or not, accepts the status quo, in which women work around abusers rather than forcing them out of our workplaces.  I can imagine a hotline for women (and men, who are not immune to sexual harassment or assault) to report abuse, one that connects the victim with a woman in her industry who is willing to guide her through the possible steps she can take. We’d leverage tools across workplaces and industries, a rational response to an economy where workers hop from job to job on an increasingly frequent basis.  In the long term, I can imagine a more formal body that compiles allegations, verifies their validity, and acts on that information — perhaps by connecting women who accuse the same man so as to enable them to coordinate a legal or public claim against him. This could be done through existing professional associations or unions, or as an entirely new project.  Whatever we do, we should encourage victims to file complaints and speak out publicly. It’s encouraging that so many articles about this have been written in the wake of the Weinstein allegations, but we should be skeptical as to what will come of this public conversation. Trauma sells and gets clicks, but we won’t stamp out these problems by changing social norms or improving “workplace culture” alone. We must show that the accused, not the accuser, will suffer when a case goes public, and do so by building institutions of support for victims who come forward.  I don’t have the answers. I’m one woman, and this is a collective problem requiring the knowledge of as many women as possible. But I do know that the status quo enabled Weinstein to abuse women for decades. It allows men in media who have raped their colleagues to continue to write, even to write about feminism. Relying on a whisper network isn’t enough; the current situation is unacceptable, and we need to think about what we can do to change it.  This essay is adapted from a Patreon post.

436,1781,10,5,2017,2017-10-05,The New York Times,New Species of Sponges Found on the Pacific Seafloor,"Plenaster craigi grow on the nodules and are vulnerable if mining for nodules commences. “We have collected a few hundreds of this sponge species and they were only found attached to the nodules,” Dr. Lim said.  “The C.C.Z. is a soft sediment habitat so the hard surfaces are limited,” Dr. Beaulieu said. While almost nothing is known of Plenaster craigi – what they eat, how they reproduce, where they are distributed – most sponge species, like corals, have to find hard surfaces to settle down on and grow while they are young, she said.  But the C.C.Z. is so vast, Dr. Glover believes that it is more likely large areas would be left undisturbed. The International Seabed Authority has already reserved wide swaths of seafloor for protection and commissioned large-scale exploration studies to establish life on the seafloor. “To get to the point where you can make informed decisions, you need to know what animals live there,” Dr. Glover said.  More pressing are the huge sediment plumes that mining activities will generate, says Ann Vanreusel, a marine biologist at Ghent University in Belgium. That’s where Plenaster craigi could prove to be useful as an indicator species because of its abundance, she says. “Every animal you collect from the seafloor seems to be a different species,” Dr. Vanreusel said. An organism that will clearly be disturbed from the plumes and abundant enough to count such as Plenaster craigi could help researchers figure out the effects of deep-sea mining and perhaps even the possibilities for recovery, she said.  “They can almost act like a canary,” Dr. Amon said.  But the key, Dr. Hannington said, is that deep-sea mining may not be economically viable. “Nobody has proved it can be done,” he said. Many details, like whether the metals can be extracted from the marine ore, still need to be worked out, he said. “If it turns out that marine mining is not economically feasible, all of the other problems go out the window.”  Dr. Glover’s team first noticed Plenaster craigi while on the 2013 expedition to the exploration area allocated to the United Kingdom. “For three years we were calling them sponge species A,” Dr. Glover said. Then in 2015, Dr. Lim participated in the second expedition to the area allocated to Singapore and began working with Dr. Glover to identify and classify the sponges. Now, Dr. Lim has begun work on a second sponge species growing on the nodules, while Dr. Glover is preparing an extensive study on deep sea mollusks.  The researchers are racing against time to study life on the seafloor while being limited not only by sample collection, but also a lack of scientists with the expertise to characterize and classify new species, Dr. Beaulieu said. “It takes a lot of time, one by one by one, to describe a new species,” she said, “and there are still so many to go.”",4.25,12,"[3.5, 5.0, 4.0, 4.0, 5.0, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.0]"

(The company at the time was owned by her parents, and when it fell into bankruptcy Ms. Quillen cashed out her 401(k) and mortgaged her home to help rescue it.) As someone whose work product appears in pixels or evanescent newsprint, I could see how an infatuation with factories might be possible.

Lytro’s camera is the size of a sumo wrestler. It gathers about 475 times more visual information than we do for a standard VR piece. Lytro’s system also features Six Degrees of Freedom (6DoF), which enables the viewer in aheadset to move around within the piece. If you are standing in front of a person, you can close the distance to them or step farther away. If you are watching an animation, you can crouch down or swivel to the side to see what the image looks like from a different angle. This freedom of movement increases the sense that you are right there with Rachel. It’s what we call “presence” — the magic of VR.  During this process, we were also working closely with Brendan Baker, a sound designer whom I knew from his work on the podcast “Love + Radio,” which is known for its innovative use of sound in storytelling. I thought of him as the mad scientist of the podcast world, which was exactly what we needed to create a sound design that could accurately represent the sounds that Rachel was hearing when she first turned on her cochlear implant. The production company Q Department came in on the back end to spatialize the sound design so the sound would adjust as you moved your head in the headset.  When Rachel got that playlist from her friends, she was trying to do something she hadn’t done before: hear music. In working on this piece, we were trying to do some things we hadn’t done before.

425,1770,10,8,2017,2017-10-08,Associated Press News,Tourism drop means Harvey still punishing Texas beach towns," Born and raised in this Texas Gulf Coast beach town, James Wheeler Jr. finds himself sawing plywood and hanging sheet rock at a time when he would normally be leading deep-sea fishing excursions, trying to hook tuna or Spanish mackerel by the cooler-full.  Since Hurricane Harvey came through Port Aransas just before Labor Day — damaging or destroying 80 percent of homes and business and wiping out the lucrative summer season’s final weeks — the 38-year-old boat captain has become an amateur builder, working to repair the roof of a sea headquarters building where he and others dock their pleasure crafts.  “Port Aransas is built on the tourist dollar,” said Wheeler, ticking off attractions besides fishing: surfing, nature reserves, seafood restaurants and beaches where it’s always cocktail hour. “That dollar’s not coming right now.”  In many Texas seaside enclaves, the owners of bars and eateries, inns and T-shirt shops are facing a painful paradox: Tourists who are their economic lifeblood likely won’t return until the rebuild is in full swing, but picking up the pieces after Harvey may not truly begin without the profits tourists bring.  “That’s the risk,” said David Teel, president of the Texas Travel Industry Association. “The recovery will come. But it will never be fast enough for these folks.”  Insurance money and support from federal grants will help residents rebuild homes and businesses, and in some cases even cover businesses’ lost income and employees’ lost wages. But that will pale in comparison to what tourists would normally be spending, likely helping ensure that recovery moves more slowly.  Locals expect the normally busy Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s holidays to be slow. Even the possibility of getting back to business by spring break looks bleak.  Visitors to Texas’ Gulf Coast spent $18.7 billion last year, according to state estimates, and the region’s tourism industry employed 170,000-plus people. Visitors spent $221 million in 2016 just in Port Aransas, a onetime fishing village that’s now home to around 4,000 full-time residents.  In other years, October is when “Winter Texans” — part-time residents from colder locales — take up temporary residence, while shorter-term tourists come for the weekends. The influx of people is normally enough to keep the economy robust through the holidays and until spring.  Wheeler says he’d usually be organizing large fishing trips nearly every day, but now takes just one smaller excursion a week.  “It’s not that no one wants to come,” Wheeler said. “There’s just nowhere for them to stay yet.”  Drivers entering Port Aransas encounter bulldozers tearing into a roadside mountain of debris more than three-stories high. Power company and internet provider vans are everywhere, as crews repair infrastructure. Golf carts — a favored mode of local transportation — have to avoid shattered glass and mangled light poles. They’re more likely, these days, to be filled with Salvation Army personnel or construction crews than tourists hitting the beach.  “We are Port A Proud and on the Rebound,” proclaims the website of the chamber of commerce, whose office was damaged. It lists six local hotels planning to be open by Christmas.  Sweeping dust out of the gutted Destination Beach and Surf store, Olya Soya said some regular visitors have come as volunteers helping to rebuild, while others simply gawk at Harvey’s wrath.  “They want to see what it looks like now. It’s very different,” said Soya, 24, who instead of working in the air-conditioned store sweats through her days on a makeshift debris removal crew. Beside her is a towering plaster shark that survived the storm despite extensive damage to the store it guarded.  Harvey’s eye passed directly over nearby Rockport, where operators hope to have 500 hotel rooms available by November — down from 1,500 pre-Harvey.  “Yes, we’re open for business. But please be patient,” said Diane Probst, president of the local chamber of commerce, adding that visitors should expect frustratingly slow debris removal.  Back in Port Aransas, dozens of restaurants and businesses have reopened, at least part time. One shop, Gratitude, suffered only light damage, despite being crammed with fragile keepsakes and knickknacks such as wind chimes and oversized wine glasses proclaiming “Summer is for mimosas and mermaids.”  “You almost feel guilty opening because there are a lot of stores and places that can’t,” said owner Sally Marco, 60. “But it’s nice to have people smile when they come in.”  One bright spot is that area beaches didn’t suffer major ill-effects. On a recent, balmy Saturday, seagulls and pelicans outnumbered the few surfers, children splashing in the waves and couples strolling on the sand with dogs.  “As these communities begin to open back up — and little pieces will open — the good part about it is, they’ve got a beach,” said Teel, of the state tourist association. “And it’s a great beach.”  ___  Sign up for the AP’s weekly newsletter showcasing our best reporting from the Midwest and Texas: http://apne.ws/2u1RMfv",3.738425925925926,216,"[5.0, 2.5, 4.5, 2.5, 5.0, 3.5, 0.5, 3.5, 3.0, 2.5, 4.5, 1.5, 3.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.0, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.0, 2.5, 2.5, 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 2.5, 2.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 0.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 3.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 5.0, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 0.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.0, 1.5, 4.0, 4.5, 2.5, 5.0, 0.5, 4.5, 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.0, 3.0, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0, 3.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 3.5, 5.0, 4.0, 4.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 2.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 2.5, 4.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0, 2.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 3.5, 1.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 4.5, 1.0, 3.0, 4.5, 3.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.0, 5.0, 3.0, 5.0, 3.5, 1.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 5.0, 4.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.0, 0.5, 4.5, 3.0, 2.0, 4.5, 1.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.0, 4.5, 5.0, 4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 5.0, 4.0, 4.5, 3.0, 4.5, 5.0, 2.5, 5.0, 4.0, 1.5, 5.0, 4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.0, 1.0, 5.0, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0, 3.0, 3.5, 3.0, 2.5, 4.5, 1.5, 3.0, 2.5, 1.0, 3.5, 5.0]"

1083,2661,10,27,2017,2017-10-27,Fox News,Mueller facing new Republican pressure to resign in Russia probe,"Special Counsel Robert Mueller is facing a fresh round of calls from conservative critics for his resignation from the Russia collusion probe, amid revelations that have called into question the FBI’s own actions and potentially Mueller’s independence.  This week’s bombshell that a controversial anti-Trump dossier was funded by the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign has Republicans asking to what extent the FBI – which received some of the findings and briefly agreed to pay the same researcher to gather intelligence on Trump and Russia – used the politically connected material.  Hill investigators also are looking into a Russian firm’s uranium deal that was approved by the Obama administration in 2010 despite reports that the FBI – then led by Mueller – had evidence of bribery involving a subsidiary of that firm.  Critics question whether Mueller’s own ties to the bureau as well as fired FBI director James Comey now render him compromised as he investigates allegations of Russian meddling and collusion with Trump officials in the 2016 race.  “The federal code could not be clearer – Mueller is compromised by his apparent conflict of interest in being close with James Comey,” Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., who first called for Mueller to step down over the summer, said in a statement to Fox News on Friday. “The appearance of a conflict is enough to put Mueller in violation of the code. … All of the revelations in recent weeks make the case stronger.”  Outgoing New Jersey GOP Gov. Chris Christie, a former federal prosecutor and Trump ally, also suggested Friday that Mueller consider stepping aside.  “If the facts that you just laid out are true, then somebody with Bob Mueller’s integrity will step aside and should -- if in fact those facts, as you laid them out, are true,” Christie said on “Fox & Friends,” in response to various conflict-of-interest allegations.  The special counsel’s office declined Fox News’ request for comment.  This is not the first time Mueller has faced calls to step down.  Congressional Republicans over the summer raised concerns over Mueller’s relationship with Comey, whom Trump ousted from the FBI in May. Reps. Franks and Andy Biggs, both Republicans from Arizona, had called for Mueller’s resignation for that reason.  President Trump has called Mueller’s relationship with Comey “bothersome,” though hasn’t said much about Mueller’s role lately even as he seizes on the latest revelations about the Fusion GPS dossier to try and turn the tables on Democrats in the Russia scandal.  “It is now commonly agreed, after many months of COSTLY looking, that there was NO collusion between Russia and Trump. Was collusion with HC!” he tweeted Friday.  But the Wall Street Journal editorial board cited the dossier development in calling for Mueller’s resignation on Thursday, saying the “troubling question is whether the FBI played a role” in aiding a “Russian disinformation campaign.”  “Two pertinent questions: Did the dossier trigger the FBI probe of the Trump campaign, and did Mr. Comey or his agents use it as evidence to seek wiretapping approval from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Trump campaign aides?” the editorial board wrote, before turning to Mueller's role:  “The Fusion news means the FBI’s role in Russia’s election interference must now be investigated—even as the FBI and Justice insist that Mr. Mueller’s probe prevents them from cooperating with Congressional investigators. Mr. Mueller is a former FBI director, and for years he worked closely with Mr. Comey. It is no slur against Mr. Mueller’s integrity to say that he lacks the critical distance to conduct a credible probe of the bureau he ran for a dozen years. He could best serve the country by resigning to prevent further political turmoil over that conflict of interest.”  Another potential issue is Mueller’s supervision of a bribery probe involving a subsidiary of Russia’s Rosatom, which eventually got approval from the U.S. to buy a Canadian mining company that controlled a swath of American uranium reserves. At the time of the probe, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller as special counsel, was a U.S. attorney and Mueller was FBI director. Republicans want to know how that deal was approved despite the evidence gathered in the bribery probe.  “The whole reason for independent counsels is to have the public trust, the professionalism and the diligence of the investigation, but they have to guard against actual conflicts of interest and apparent conflicts of interest,” said former high-ranking Justice Department official James Trusty, who served under the Bush and Obama administrations. “There may be some tipping point, though, separating facts from rumors, and we may be close to the tipping point.”  Earlier this week, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, called for a separate special counsel to investigate the Uranium One deal.  GRASSLEY CALLS FOR SPECIAL COUNSEL TO INVESTIGATE URANIUM ONE DEAL  Grassley, however, stopped short of suggesting he didn’t trust Mueller.  “There might be reasons to wonder his involvement because of his involvement with the previous administration during this period of time. There’s no way that I can make any accusations against Mr. Mueller because he is a man of high ethical standards,” Grassley told “Fox & Friends” on Thursday.  Other Republicans have sought to protect Mueller from interference.  There are currently two pieces of legislation in the Senate, with bipartisan sponsorship, that would ensure a judicial check on the executive branch’s ability to remove a special counsel. Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Thom Tillis, R-N.C., are behind the bills, along with Democratic senators.  SENATORS INTRODUCE BILL TO PROTECT SPECIAL COUNSEL FROM FIRING  Comey’s attorney, David Kelley, also has disputed the characterizations of the Mueller-Comey relationship interviews in the past.  “Bob and Jim have a congenial relationship as former colleagues. Both served long legal careers that involved overlapping time spent within the Department of Justice, and that’s pretty well documented. But beyond that, they’re not close, personal friends,” Kelley told the Washington Post this summer. “They’re friends in the sense that co-workers are friends. They don’t really have a personal relationship.”  Kelley told Fox News on Friday that he stands by those comments.  Mueller, meanwhile, has been criticized by Republicans for the makeup of his investigative team, which includes several Democratic donors.  “As these various Russian related allegations swirl, I think Mueller increasingly regrets his decision to pick a staff in which half of the prosecutors had either given to, or participated, in Democratic causes,” Trusty said. “That was an unforced error.”",0.6666666666666666,3,"[0.5, 0.5, 1.0]"

Derek Starnes told WFTS that he noticed a small, black hole on the side of a smoke detector in the room. When he took it down to get a better look, Starnes, who works in tech, realized the hole was a camera. The camera was pointing right at the couple’s bed.  Starnes then called the police, who later arrested homeowner Wayne Natt, 56. Natt has since been charged with one count of video voyeurism, Fox 13 reported.  ""I would've never noticed,"" Lt. Bob Bourque of the Longboat Key Police Department told Fox 13. ""The smoke detector had a small black dot where the camera was mounted on the side of it. There was one in the master bedroom which was pointed at a bed and then one in the living room.""  Starnes, who said both he and his wife are “distressed by this situation,” hopes that those who have previously rented from Natt will come forward.  Natt told police that the camera was used to record sexual activity, according to Bourque, who added that Natt said he hid the camera in the smoke detector to get “a better angle.” Natt also claimed renters knew they were being filmed, according to Bourque.  In a statement to Fox 13, Airbnb said it was “outraged at the reports of what happened.”  “As soon as we were made aware, we permanently banned this individual from our community and fully supported the affected guests. Our team has reached out to local law enforcement to aid them with their investigation of the egregious offense and we hope justice is served. We take privacy issues extremely seriously and have a zero-tolerance policy against this behavior.”  Prior to his arrest, Natt had more than 40 reviews on Airbnb and had been on the home-sharing site for two years, Fox 13 reported.

593,1989,10,14,2017,2017-10-14,Associated Press News,Trump leaves Republicans with heavy lift on Iran deal,"Pedestrians make their way on a sidewalk in downtown Tehran, Iran, Saturday, Oct. 14, 2017. President Donald Trump's refusal to certify the Iran nuclear deal has sparked a new war of words between the Islamic Republic and America, fueling growing mistrust and a sense of nationalism among Iranians. (AP Photo/Vahid Salemi)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Republicans demanded a major say on the Iran nuclear agreement two years ago and never got it from Democrat Barack Obama. Now that President Donald Trump has directed Congress to make the international pact more stringent, the GOP is finding that having that voice won’t be easy.  Republicans will have to win over skeptical Democrats and key allies in Europe who are wary of altering the accord that they believe has prevented Iran from assembling an arsenal of atomic weapons in exchange for lifting economic sanctions. Republican leaders also may face resistance from members of their own party.  Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said Friday he’ll reserve judgment on any legislation but has “serious doubts about whether it is even possible to fix such a dangerously flawed agreement.”  Trump on Friday angrily accused Iran of violating the spirit of the nuclear deal that was forged with the U.S. and other world powers in 2015, blaming Tehran for a litany of malign behavior and hitting its main military wing with anti-terrorism sanctions. But the president, breaking with a campaign pledge to rip up the agreement, said he was not yet ready to pull the U.S. out or re-impose nuclear sanctions.  Instead he kicked the issue to Congress and told them to toughen the law.  Taking the lead will be the Republican whom Trump has been feuding with — Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. Trump belittled Corker this past week with a series of tweets and erroneously blamed the senator, who will retire at the end of next year, for the original Iran deal. Corker dubbed the White House an “adult day care center” and charged that Trump could be setting the nation on the path to world war.  Corker, in a conference call with reporters on Friday, focused on perhaps the most significant task of his chairmanship and didn’t address the bitter back and forth with Trump.  He previewed the main elements of legislation he is developing with Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., a national security hawk who has echoed Trump’s more confrontational approach toward Iran, to toughen the nuclear accord and the law governing U.S. participation in the deal.  “Over the last several months, we have been working closely with the State Department, National Security Council and Senator Cotton to develop a legislative strategy to address bipartisan concerns about the (Iran deal) without violating U.S. commitments,” Corker said in a statement.  On the call, Corker promised an open legislative process.  “You’re going to see all this evolve in daylight,” he said, adding that the bill could be introduced in the next two weeks.  The legislation would amend a two-year-old law that allowed Congress to review the accord. It would reduce from four to two the number of times a year Trump is required to certify to Congress that Iran is complying with the terms of the agreement.  It would also rid the deal of sunset provisions, which expire after predetermined periods of time. The provisions relate to enriching uranium to levels near those needed to produce the fuel for a nuclear weapon, as well as other activities that limit Iran’s atomic capabilities at various sites. The bill would propose a mechanism to automatically restore the prior U.S. sanctions if Iran gets within a year of acquiring a nuclear weapon.  The emerging bill also would give the International Atomic Energy Agency greater power to verify that Iran is complying with the deal.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., welcomed Trump’s decision and cast it as an opportunity for Congress to strengthen the law it passed in 2015 and “create a standard for certification that is consistent with our interests.”  Democrats condemned Trump’s announcement and criticized him for punting presidential responsibilities to Congress just as he did on health care and extending protection from deportation for young immigrants known as “Dreamers.”  Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, the top ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, issued a sharply worded statement that called Trump’s move a “reckless, political decision” that put U.S. national security at risk. He said the president and his Cabinet should be principally in charge of addressing concerns about the Iran deal.  “Instead, he is abdicating his leadership role to Congress, just like with Dreamers and just like with affirming and strengthening our health care system,” said Cardin, who opposed the nuclear deal two years ago but is now opposed to ditching the pact. “It is a troubling pattern. We will not buy into the false premise that it is Congress’ role to legislate solutions to problems of his own making.”  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called Trump’s move a “grave mistake.”  Without changes, Trump warned, he would probably pull the U.S. out of the deal — which he has called the worst in U.S. history — and snap previously lifted sanctions back into place.  ___  Follow Richard Lardner on Twitter at http://twitter.com/rplardner",2.5,4,"[4.5, 4.5, 0.5, 0.5]"
937,2438,10,24,2017,2017-10-24,Fox News,"Climate change already costing US taxpayers billions in losses, GAO report says","A non-partisan federal watchdog released a report Monday that said climate change is already costing taxpayers billions each year and warns that the amount is likely to increase in the future.  A Government Accountability Office report said the federal government has spent more than $350 billion over the last decade on disaster assistance programs and losses from flood and crop insurance. That tally does not include the massive toll from this year’s three major hurricanes and wildfires, expected to be among the most costly in the nation’s history.  The report predicts these costs will only grow in the future, potentially reaching a budget busting $35 billion a year by 2050. The report says the federal government doesn’t effectively plan for these recurring costs, classifying the financial exposure from climate-related costs as “high risk.”  “The federal government has not undertaken strategic government-wide planning to manage climate risks by using information on the potential economic effects of climate change to identify significant risks and craft appropriate federal responses,” the study said. “By using such information, the federal government could take the initial step in establishing government-wide priorities to manage such risks.”  President Trump has called climate change a hoax, announcing his intent to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accords and revoke Obama-era initiatives to curb greenhouse gas emissions.  Trump has also appointed officials such as EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, all of whom question the scientific consensus that carbon released into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels is the primary driver of global warming.  GAO undertook the study following a request from Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.  Collins said that her state is “inextricably linked to the environment. We are experiencing a real change in the sea life, which has serious implications for the livelihoods of many people across our state, including those who work in our iconic lobster industry.”  The report’s authors reviewed 30 government and academic studies examining the national and regional impacts of climate change. They also interviewed 28 experts familiar with the strengths and limitations of the studies, which rely on future projections of climate impacts to estimate likely costs.  The report says the fiscal impacts of climate change are likely to vary widely by region. The Southeast is at increased risk because of coastal property that could be swamped by storm surge and sea level rise. The Northeast is also under threat from storm surge and sea level rise, though not as much as the Southeast.  The Midwest and Great Plains are susceptible to decreased crop yields, the report said. The west is expected to see increased drought, wildfires and deadly heatwaves.  Advance copies were provided to the White House and the Environmental Protection Agency, which provided no official comments for inclusion in the GAO report.  Requests for comment from The Associated Press also received no response on Monday.  Earlier this month Trump nominated Kathleen Hartnett White of Texas to serve as his top environmental adviser at the White House. She has credited the fossil fuel industry with “vastly improved living conditions across the world” and likened the work of mainstream climate scientists to “the dogmatic claims of ideologues and clerics.”  White, who works at a conservative think tank that has received funding from fossil-fuel companies, holds academic degrees in East Asian studies and comparative literature.

The conversations described in charging documents cut to the heart of Mueller’s investigation, reflecting Papadopoulos’ efforts to arrange meetings between Trump aides and Russian government intermediaries and revealing how he learned the Russians had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton in the form of “thousands of emails.”  White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders says Donald Trump campaign staffer George Papadopoulos' guilty plea is an example of a person who ""did the wrong thing"" while ""the president's campaign did the right thing. (Oct. 31)  Though the contacts may not by themselves have been illegal, the oblique but telling references to unnamed people — including “Professor” and “Female Russian National” — make clear that Mueller’s team has identified multiple people who had knowledge of back-and-forth outreach efforts between Russians and associates of the Trump election effort.  It’s a reality that challenges the administration’s portrait of Papadopoulos as a back-bench operator within the campaign, an argument repeated Tuesday by White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who dismissed him as a “volunteer” with a minimal role.  In charging the 30-year-old Papadopoulos with lying to the FBI, Mueller’s team is warning of a similar fate for anyone whose statements deviate from the facts.  “I think everyone to whom Mueller and his team wanted to send a message heard loud and clear the message,” said Jacob Frenkel, a Washington defense lawyer.  The White House had braced over the weekend for an indictment of Manafort and for allegations of financial misconduct that it could dismiss as unrelated to the campaign or administration. Then came the unsealing of Papadopoulos’ guilty plea and an accompanying statement of facts that detailed his desire to set up a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, and his cooperation with prosecutors since his arrest at an airport last summer.  The extent of the contacts is substantial. During a six-month period ending Aug. 15, Papadopoulos met, telephoned, Skyped or emailed his three foreign contacts or five different Trump campaign officials a total of 29 times. He also traveled twice to London and once to Italy. Another trip to Moscow was canceled.  There are clear indications that prosecutors probing possible criminal activity have leaned on Papadopoulos to gather more information about the campaign as they probe possible criminal activity.  He was arrested in July, but the case was not unsealed until Monday, giving prosecutors weeks to debrief him for information. He was initially arrested on false statements and obstruction of justice allegations, but pleaded guilty only to lying to the FBI, a possible token of leniency for further cooperation.  In court papers, prosecutors have said prematurely making the case public would restrict his ability to be a “proactive cooperator,” which legal experts say could including surreptitious techniques like wearing a microphone to record conversations.  “I would infer from that that he was working proactively on behalf of the prosecutors, which would mean going out and obtaining evidence,” said former Justice Department prosecutor Peter Zeidenberg.  Though the campaign officials and other people referenced in the complaint are not named, it’s nonetheless possible to ferret out the identities of several.  For instance, Joseph Mifsud is the “London professor” who figures prominently in the case as a would-be link between the Trump campaign and Russia, according to a comparison of court papers and emails obtained by The Associated Press. Mifsud confirmed to The Telegraph newspaper that he is the professor.  In court papers, Mifsud is described as having met repeatedly with Papadopoulos and having offered to set up meetings with Russian officials who could provide “thousands of emails” with damaging information about Clinton.  Papadopoulos told the FBI he did not tell anyone in the campaign about the “dirt” because he thought the foreign contact might be a “nothing.”  The professor is also credited in the document with introducing Papadopoulos to a woman referred to as a “female Russian national” who served as a potential link to the Russian government. Papadopoulos described her incorrectly in emails to Trump campaign officials as Putin’s niece. She has not yet been identified publicly.  Mifsud, a vocal Putin backer, told the newspaper the FBI case lacks credibility and that he did not tell anyone he could produce emails that would weaken the Clinton campaign.  Papadopoulos’ place on the Trump campaign was formalized in March when Trump adviser Sam Clovis released the names of eight foreign policy advisers amid public pressure on Trump to disclose his foreign policy team.  A lawyer representing Clovis confirmed in a statement that he was the person, identified as the “Campaign Supervisor” in court papers, who brought Papadopoulos onto the advisory committee. In court papers, the unnamed supervisor receives some of Papadopoulos’ email exchanges about his attempts to line up a meeting with the Russians, appearing to encourage the effort at one point by responding “Great work.” He also later encouraged Papadopoulos to travel to Russia on his own.  The lawyer’s statement said Clovis opposed any trip to Russia for Trump or his campaign staff but noted that Clovis may not have made his opposition known when “a volunteer made suggestions on a foreign policy matter.”  The foreign policy advisory council on which Papadopoulos sat met on a monthly basis throughout the spring and summer for a total of about six times, according to an official involved with the group. Papadopoulos, who was based in London at the time, did not attend all of the meetings, but he did attend a dinner meeting of the advisers in late June at the Capitol Hill Club in Washington with Attorney General Jeff Sessions.  Trump released a photo of the meeting on social media.  Papadopoulos, who had no formal responsibilities, communicated most with Clovis and Manafort, according to an official involved with the group who was unauthorized to disclose internal campaign activities. Papadopoulos angered some on the foreign policy team in early May by urging former British Prime Minister David Cameron to apologize after calling Trump “divisive, stupid and wrong.”  ___  Associated Press writers Steve Peoples in Washington and Greg Katz in London contributed to this report.",3.2666666666666666,15,"[0.5, 5.0, 3.5, 1.5, 4.0, 2.0, 0.5, 4.0, 5.0, 1.5, 4.5, 4.5, 5.0, 3.0, 4.5]"
1319,2918,11,3,2017,2017-11-03,Fox News,This artificial intelligence can detect if someone is having suicidal thoughts,"Artificial intelligence could one day be used to help identify a person contemplating suicide.  Around 800,000 people die a year from suicide, according to the World Health Organization. It’s currently the second-leading cause of death in the U.S. among people between the ages of 15 and 24.  But a new study is using brain scans and AI to show how someone experiencing suicidal thoughts thinks differently about life and death. The results were published in Nature Human Behavior.  “What is central to this new study is that we can tell whether someone is considering suicide by the way that they are thinking about the death-related topics,” Marcel Just, the study’s co-lead author, told CMU.edu.  Researchers looked at 34 participants, 17 of whom were experiencing suicidal thoughts. Each person underwent brain imaging with an MRI machine while being shown a series of words that were related to different emotions. Ten words had a positive emotional relation, such as “carefree,” 10 were negative, like “trouble,” and 10 were related to suicide, including “desperate” and “hopeless.”  Based on the participants that were already considered suicidal, the researchers were able to map five regions of the brain and six words that could identify someone as suicidal. Next they devised an algorithm to spot the same thing.  The algorithm correctly identified 15 of the 17 suicidal patients and 16 of the 17 members in the control group.  Researchers then applied the algorithm to the group of participants experiencing suicidal thoughts – half had previously attempted suicide and half had not. The algorithm correctly identified 94 percent of the participants who had attempted suicide.  “Further testing of this approach in a larger sample will determine its ability to predict future suicidal behavior,” said David Brent, co-head author of the study. “And could give clinicians in the future a way to identify, monitor and perhaps intervene with the altered and often distorted thinking that so often characterizes seriously suicidal individuals.”  This story originally appeared in the New York Post.",3.4545454545454546,11,"[3.5, 2.5, 4.5, 1.5, 4.5, 3.0, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.0, 5.0]"

Among them was a Vanity Fair report saying he's struggling in the position, and his relationship with President Trump is ""irreparable.""  But Kelly told reporters he's staying put.  “I’m not quitting today. I don’t think I’m being fired today. I am not so frustrated in this job that I am thinking of leaving,” Kelly told reporters, adding he is “not frustrated.” “I will tell you this is the hardest job I’ve ever had.”  Kelly added that, “Unless things change, I’m not quitting.

Kelly told reporters that he decided not to do “too much press” until he got his “feet off the ground.”  He took questions from the press on a variety of issues, but repeatedly took issue with media reports on the internal tensions in the administration, even as he joked and sparred with the White House press corps.  The former Marine general and secretary of the Department of Homeland Security told reporters that his “only frustration” was reading news that is “just not true.”  “My only frustration, with all respect to people in the room, is to come to work and read about things I allegedly said or Mr. Trump allegedly said and it’s just not true,” Kelly said, echoing the president’s “fake news” mantra. “And I mean no disrespect to you all.”  Kelly went on to address reports that he is having trouble 'controlling' the president, saying he was ""not brought to this job to control"" Trump's tweets.

The number of firearms in the United States has steadily increased over the past two decades. It rose to 310 million in 2009, up from 259 million in 2000 and 192 million in 1994.  Gun homicides, meanwhile, fell dramatically from a 1993 peak of a rate of 7.02 per 100,000 people; by 1999, it was at 3.82 per 100,000 people. But the homicide rate has remained steady since then, suggesting the correlation between the number of guns and number of gun killings does not hold past the turn of the millennium.

A flurry of Twitter posts compared spending by the N.R.A. to Planned Parenthood, two groups that are consistently among the nation’s top political contributors.  Both groups give vastly less to candidates directly than they invest in outside spending, or expenditures made independent of a candidate often in the form of political advertisements.  For example, the N.R.A. — through affiliated groups and individuals — donated $839,215 to candidates in the 2016 campaign cycle, while Planned Parenthood contributed $904,420.  But the gun group poured $54 million in outside spending in 2016, more than triple Planned Parenthood’s amount. The N.R.A.’s cumulative spending across three election cycles tops $104 million, more than double than the $41 million spent by Planned Parenthood during the same time, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, the campaign finance watchdog.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The impact of gun silencers can be overstated.  Among the calls for tougher gun restrictions, Hillary Clinton tweeted on Monday to criticize a House bill that would make it easier to purchase gun silencers. “Imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer, which the N.R.A. wants to make easier to get,” Mrs. Clinton wrote the day after the massacre in Las Vegas.  Addressing other claims that were far more dramatic, The Washington Post Fact Checker awarded three Pinocchios out of four to statements that the gunshot suppressor makes the weapon “quiet.” Mrs. Clinton did not go quite that far.  It is not known yet exactly what weapons Mr. Paddock used in the shootings, but a federal law enforcement official said they included AR-15-style rifles.  A typical AR-15 produces a decibel level of around 167, “give or take depending on environmental conditions,” according to the Loadout Room, a gear review website. With an average gun suppressor or silencer attached, the rifle’s decibel levels lower to about 136 decibels. Unsilenced, the gun would be louder than a jet engine or fireworks at a very close distance. With a suppressor, it would be as about as loud as jackhammer.  Mrs. Clinton has a point that suppressors also make it harder to tell where gunshots are coming from, especially as was the case during the concert in Las Vegas, with its blaring music.  Given the many variables involved, it’s extremely difficult — if not impossible — to determine what impact a silencer would have had. But it would not have “silenced” the weapons.",5.0,1,[5.0]
1096,2674,10,27,2017,2017-10-27,Vox,The deadlier drug crises that we don’t consider public health emergencies,"In 2016, this drug was linked to more deaths than guns, car crashes, or even HIV/AIDS at its peak. Actually, it was associated with more deaths than guns and car crashes combined.  I’m not talking about opioids. I’m talking about alcohol.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), excessive drinking is linked to 88,000 deaths each year — more than all the 64,000 drug overdose deaths in 2016. That includes all potential alcohol deaths: liver cirrhosis, poisonings, crimes related to alcohol, driving while intoxicated, and so on. But it’s a very high death rate — making alcohol the third leading cause of preventable death in the US.  What’s worse, the 88,000 number may, at this point, be an underestimate. The figure comes from an analysis of deaths between 2006 and 2010. But since then, we’ve seen some signs that alcohol deaths may have gone up: Between 2010 and 2015, the number of alcohol-induced deaths (those that involve direct health complications from alcohol, like liver cirrhosis) rose from nearly 26,000 to more than 33,000.  Alcohol isn’t even the deadliest drug in the US; that would be tobacco. Smoking is linked to, depending on the estimate, 480,000 to 540,000 deaths each year — the leading preventable cause of death in America. (This figure is potentially too high, since it’s based on mortality data from 2005 to 2009, and smoking rates have dropped since then. Still, it’s an extremely high death toll.)  Yet all of these deaths didn’t inspire President Donald Trump or the presidents before him to formally declare a public health emergency over tobacco or alcohol, as Trump finally did for opioids on Thursday. We don’t often call alcohol or tobacco “epidemics,” even as we regularly use that same language for opioids that are linked to a fraction of the deaths from alcohol or tobacco.  Maybe we should. We have a lot of evidence that we could do much more to combat alcohol and tobacco deaths. But we haven’t.  We’ve become desensitized to legal drug deaths  Part of the reason there are far more deaths from alcohol and tobacco than other drugs is because alcohol and tobacco are legal for recreational purposes and, therefore, far more accessible. If you were to look at deaths per user, several other drugs — such as the dangerous synthetic opioid fentanyl — would very likely pull ahead.  But that’s not a reason to ignore the problems alcohol and tobacco pose. They still lead to tens of thousands of people needlessly dying in the case of alcohol and hundreds of thousands dying when it comes to tobacco.  Yet we have become desensitized to these drugs. When I’ve asked drug policy experts about this, they have attributed it to the fact that alcohol and tobacco — and the deaths they cause — have just been with us for a long time. That’s made the deaths feel routine.  That’s not to say that policymakers have done nothing about either. Anti-tobacco campaigns, particularly since the 1990s, have done a lot to reduce smoking rates. (About 16.8 percent of adults reported smoking recently in 2014, down from 42.4 percent in 1965.) Similarly, the push to take drunk driving seriously in the 1980s helped reduce both alcohol-related deaths and car crashes.  But we don’t seem to take these issues very seriously. Even after the efforts of the past few decades, tobacco use is linked to hundreds of thousands deaths a year and alcohol use is linked to tens of thousands of deaths a year. Yet how often do you see the president or other federal lawmakers making big speeches about either, calling for a national emergency declaration?  Lawmakers don’t even take these issues seriously when the money to do something about them is simply handed over. In the 1990s, states sued tobacco companies for all the death and disease their products have caused, reaching the Master Settlement Agreement. The idea was that tobacco companies would over time pay an exorbitant amount of money — more than $240 billion over 25 years — that could then be used for anti-tobacco programs.  Yet when NPR checked in on the settlement in 2013, it found that the money had not been used as planned: “Colorado has spent tens of millions of its share to support a literacy program, while Kentucky has invested half of its money in agricultural programs.” In the end, states fell far short of the goal, recommended by the CDC, to spend 14 percent of their settlement funds on anti-smoking programs.  And this is tobacco, which is widely recognized as a public health menace. Similar efforts to treat alcohol as a serious public health issue don’t even exist.  That’s not because we are helpless in the face of alcohol and tobacco; to the contrary, there are plenty of evidence-backed policy proposals out there. It’s because we are, as a country, seemingly apathetic to the death these drugs cause.  There are plenty of things we could do about alcohol and tobacco  In drug policy discussions, we typically talk about drugs in a binary framework: You either legalize them or prohibit them. Whenever I write about alcohol-related deaths, for example, I get a ton of reader emails asking why I want Prohibition to come back. Don’t I know how much of a failure that was?  The reality, though, is there are plenty of policy interventions we could take on before reaching for prohibition.  For alcohol, the research backs raising the alcohol tax. It supports limiting the number of alcohol outlets. There are innovative evidence-based policies that temporarily yank a person’s right to drink if they get in trouble with the law due to alcohol. We could also put states, instead of private businesses, in charge of alcohol sales, which the research shows can keep prices higher, reduce access to youth, and reduce overall levels of use. And we could increase access to evidence-based addiction treatment.  With tobacco, we have other evidence-backed policies: raising taxes to reduce access; improving access to safer alternatives to smoking like nicotine gum, nicotine patches, and e-cigarettes; using stronger warning labels; and raising the smoking age.  Some jurisdictions have taken up these kinds of interventions. New York City, for one, has a famously high cigarette tax, and it has a phone line that people can use to get in touch with a clinic or obtain free nicotine patches or free nicotine gum; it has seen its smoking rate drop from 21.5 percent in 2002 to 14.3 percent in 2015. Meanwhile, five states have increased their legal smoking age to 21.  These policy interventions, though, aren’t pushed with the same kind of vigor and all-hands-on-deck effort we see with opioids, at least rhetorically, today. That’s especially the case with alcohol, which is many Americans’ drug of choice and has a powerful, big lobby behind it — making lawmakers cautious about raising alcohol taxes even to keep up with inflation or instituting policies as simple as labeling alcohol with nutrition facts.  We saw this as Trump gave his speech about his opioid emergency. He acknowledged that alcohol can be a big problem, retelling the tragic story of his own brother’s battle with alcohol addiction and eventual death as a result.  “He was a strong guy, but it was a tough, tough thing that he was going through,” Trump said. “But I learned because of Fred. I learned.”  At the end of the day, though, Trump’s emergency declaration wasn’t about alcohol. It was only about a group of drugs that, while absolutely dangerous and in need of more policy interventions, is linked to fewer deaths than everyday booze.",3.95,20,"[5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 2.5, 2.5, 5.0, 3.5, 3.0, 0.5, 4.5, 4.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 5.0]"

1464,3111,11,6,2017,2017-11-06,Fox News,Congress opens door to nixing ObamaCare mandate in tax bill,"Top House Republicans have opened the door to using their sweeping tax bill to repeal ObamaCare's individual mandate, as they began retooling the tax proposal Monday in pursuit of a final version that can pass Congress.  House Speaker Paul Ryan, the top Republican in the GOP-controlled chamber, this weekend acknowledged that a measure to nix the requirement to buy health insurance could be included in the final tax package.  “We have an active conversation with our members and a whole host of ideas on things to add to this bill,” Ryan, R-Wis., told “Fox News Sunday.” “And that’s one of the things that’s being discussed.”  The mandate, which imposes a tax penalty on Americans who fail to buy insurance under ObamaCare, is considered a critical component of the 2010 health care law. While previous efforts to overhaul the law have failed, repealing just the mandate could have significant consequences.  Ryan attempted to make clear that House leadership isn’t driving the new repeal push. Rather, President Trump last week challenged Congress to end the mandate.  “Wouldn't it be great to Repeal the very unfair and unpopular Individual Mandate in ObamaCare and use those savings for further Tax Cuts for the Middle Class,” the president tweeted Wednesday, one day after House Republicans released their plan.  Trump’s request surprised congressional Republicans, considering they carefully crafted a tax plan with hopes it could pass the GOP-controlled House and Senate and even garner some bipartisan support. A mandate repeal could drive away wavering Democrats. But the call also comes as Americans face soaring premiums under the health law for 2018.  If successful, Trump could in part fulfill a major campaign promise to dismantle ObamaCare -- after the Senate failed this summer to pass a House-approved replacement plan.  “The president feels very strongly about including this at some step along the process. He’s told me that twice by phone and once in person,” Texas Rep. Kevin Brady, chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, said last week at a Politico forum.  The committee on Monday approved a “substitute” amendment introduced by Brady which replaces the old bill text. The substitute amendment does not include a repeal of the individual mandate. However, the House Ways and Means Committee has planned several days of “markup” sessions where members continue to craft the bill, line by line. This could continue through late Wednesday or early Thursday.  Fox News is told there is consternation from the House Republican leadership about adding a repeal of the mandate to the legislation. Part of the problem is that they don’t want to conflate health care with tax reform – since the resolution to the former went so poorly earlier this year. This could be added in the Rules Committee later on.  Repealing the mandate could reduce the federal deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars, even though it would end a steady tax-revenue stream for the federal government from fines.  Because Americans would no longer be forced to buy insurance, fewer would use federally funded Medicaid or require federal subsidies to pay for premiums, which would result in a net savings.  A report last year by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected that repealing the mandate starting in 2018 would by 2026 reduce federal budget deficits by roughly $400 billion.  The idea of nixing the mandate in the tax bill is being touted by Arkansas GOP Sen. Tom Cotton.  “I have what I would call maybe a creative idea, a novel idea,” Cotton said last week. “We can repeal the individual mandate of ObamaCare and save $300 to $400 billion dollars. … That's not my math. That's the math of the Congressional Budget Office.”  Brady has asked the CBO for a new analysis, which could be released as early as this week.  However, ending the individual mandate doesn’t appear to have support among congressional Democrats, particularly in the Senate where Republicans have just a 52-48 member majority.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer hasn’t outright opposed repealing the mandate in the GOP tax overhaul bill but has suggested the idea could itself kill the plan.  “A lot of the Republicans said this bill is too heavy a lift already,” the New York Democrat told reporters Friday. “To add that to it might be the straw that would break the camel’s back even further. So I think it is unlikely that they would add that. “  “It has been more than three decades since America’s tax code was reformed under President Ronald Reagan,” Brady said. “Our committee has dedicated a substantial amount of time, energy, and work to the pursuit of one landmark goal -- delivering comprehensive tax reform to the American people.”  Fox News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.",4.666666666666667,3,"[5.0, 4.5, 4.5]"
828,2285,10,20,2017,2017-10-20,Breitbart,James Comey Claimed ‘No Special’ Rules for Clinton Just Days After Drafting Statement Excusing Her Mishandling of Classified Info,"Former FBI Director James Comey claimed last year there was “no special set of rules” for Hillary Clinton, just nine days after he circulated a draft statement of the statement that would exonerate her for her email use — a statement drafted before several key interviews.  Comey was asked by Fox News’ Catherine Herridge in May 2016 whether Clinton, in connection with the investigation into her use of a private email server when she was secretary of state, would be subject to a special set of rules because she is “powerful and politically connected.”  “I’m not going to comment, other than to say there are no special set of rules for anybody that the FBI investigates,” he replied.  Yet, the FBI revealed Monday that Comey had drafted the statement months before he interviewed Clinton and other key officials, with a release called “Drafts of Director Comeys [sic] July 5, 2016 Statement Regarding Email Server Investigation Part 01 of 01.”  While almost all of it is redacted, it an email titled “Midyear Exam — UNCLASSIFIED” sent from Comey on May 2, 2016, to a group including Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, general counsel James Baker and chief of staff James Rybicki.  The document also shows a May 16 response from Rybicki requests comments “so we may roll into a master doc for discussion with the Director at a future date.”  In that statement, eventually delivered in July, Comey blasted Clinton at length for being “extremely careless” with classified information when she served as secretary of state. However, crucially for Clinton and her presidential campaign, he did not recommend charges to the Justice Department.  The release appears to confirm the contents of a letter sent by Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) to FBI Director Christopher Wray in August in which he wrote that “it appears that in April or early May of 2016, Mr. Corney had already decided he would issue a statement exonerating Secretary Clinton.”  Fox News has since contacted Comey’s book agent asking Comey to explain the May 2 email, but did not receive a response.

900,2391,10,16,2017,2017-10-16,Vox,"Cambridge Analytica, the shady data firm that might be a key Trump-Russia link, explained","The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has requested that a data analytics company called Cambridge Analytica turn over internal documents as part of its investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.  Cambridge Analytica specializes in what’s called “psychographic” profiling, meaning they use data collected online to create personality profiles for voters. They then take that information and target individuals with specifically tailored content (more on this below).  So far there’s been a lot of speculation about the potential links between the Trump campaign and Russia, and most of the stories have orbited around the financial dealings of the Trump family and people like Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign manager. But this story is specifically about how team Trump, with the help of this data company, might have facilitated Russia’s meddling in the US presidential election.  So here’s what we know about Cambridge Analytica, its connections to the Trump campaign, and what sorts of things Mueller is likely looking into.  Trump’s digital army  In June 2016, the Trump campaign hired Cambridge Analytica to take over its data operations.  We know from the reporting of Nicholas Confessore and Danny Hakim at the New York Times that Jared Kushner, who was charged with overseeing Trump’s digital operations, is the reason Cambridge Analytica joined the Trump campaign.  Kushner hired a man named Brad Parscale, a Texas-based digital expert who had worked previously for team Trump. According to Confessore and Hakim, Cambridge Analytica convinced Parscale (who has since agreed to be interviewed by the House Intelligence Committee) to “try out the firm.” The decision was reinforced by Trump’s campaign manager, Steve Bannon, who is also a former vice president of Cambridge Analytica.  It’s not clear to what extent Cambridge Analytica helped (Parscale denied that Cambridge was of any use in a recent 60 Minutes interview), but we do know that Trump’s digital operation was shockingly effective. Samuel Woolley, who heads the Computational Propaganda project at Oxford’s Internet Institute, found that a disproportionate amount of pro-Trump messaging was spread via automated bots and anti-Hillary propaganda. Trump’s bots, they reported at the time of the election, outnumbered Clinton’s five to one.  Pro-Trump programmers “carefully adjusted the timing of content production during the debates, strategically colonized pro-Clinton hashtags, and then disabled activities after Election Day.”  Martin Moore, director of the Centre for the Study of Media, Communication and Power at King’s College, told the Guardian’s Carole Cadwalladr that Trump’s campaign “was using 40-50,000 variants of ads every day that were continuously measuring responses and then adapting and evolving based on that response.”  These online ads were spread primarily through bots on social media platforms. The ads that got liked, shared, and retweeted the most were reproduced and redistributed based on where they were popular and who they appealed to.  The benefit of this kind of data is that it allows data companies like Cambridge Analytica to develop more sophisticated psychological profiles of internet users (more data points means more predictive power).  Cambridge Analytica was also able to use this real-time information to determine which messages were resonating where and then shape Trump’s travel schedule around it. So, if there was a spike in clicks on an article about immigration in a county in Pennsylvania or Wisconsin, Trump would go there and give an immigration-focused speech.  When you consider how a few thousands votes in a handful of swing states determined the election, this is no small thing.  Flynn and the Russians  In early July, Shane Harris of the Wall Street Journal released a series of reports that offered some of the most compelling evidence yet that Trump’s campaign colluded with Russian hackers.  Harris interviewed a man named Peter Smith, a pro-Trump GOP operative who sought to acquire the 30,000 deleted emails from Hillary Clinton’s private server. Of the several hacker groups Smith reached out to, at least two had connections to Russia — that’s according to Smith.  Smith told Harris that he was in regular contact with Gen. Michael Flynn, who at the time was one of Trump’s closest confidants — and of course later became Trump’s national security adviser.  Here’s a key passage from the Harris report, which my Vox colleague Andrew Prokop highlighted at the time:  “He [Smith] said, ‘I’m talking to Michael Flynn about this — if you find anything, can you let me know?’” said Eric York, a computer-security expert from Atlanta who searched hacker forums on Mr. Smith’s behalf for people who might have access to the emails. ... ...In phone conversations, Mr. Smith told a computer expert he was in direct contact with Mr. Flynn and his son, according to this expert. ... The expert said that based on his conversations with Mr. Smith, he understood the elder Mr. Flynn to be coordinating with Mr. Smith’s group in his capacity as a Trump campaign adviser.  Harris examined intelligence reports that described the efforts of Russian hackers to retrieve emails from Clinton’s server and pass them along to Flynn, who would then share them with the Trump campaign.  By itself, Harris’s reporting makes no connection to Cambridge Analytica. But in August the Associated Press published a report that helped connect the dots. In an amended public financial filing, Flynn was forced to disclose “a brief advisory role with a firm related to a controversial data analysis company that aided the Trump campaign.”  The “data analysis company” is none other than Cambridge Analytica. The precise amount of money Cambridge paid to Flynn is unknown, as are the details of Flynn’s role.  But we know that congressional and DOJ investigators believe that Trump’s campaign might have helped guide Russia’s voter targeting scheme and that Flynn, who worked for Trump’s campaign and with Cambridge Analytica, is suspected of having extensive ties with Russian operatives.  A Cambridge Analytica spokesperson confirmed to Vox that the company is cooperating with the Russia investigation but flatly denied any wrongdoing.  “As one of the companies that played a prominent role in the election campaign, Cambridge Analytica has been asked by the House Intelligence Committee to provide it with information that might help its investigation,” the statement said. “We believe that other organizations that worked on the campaign have been asked to do the same. CA is not under investigation, and there is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by the company.”  What does Cambridge Analytica actually do?  If you use the internet or social media, you leave behind a digital trail of crumbs. Every post you like, every tweet you retweet, every thread you participate in — it’s all data up for collection and input.  Cambridge Analytica, a company created by Robert Mercer, a billionaire patron of right-wing outlets like Breitbart News, has been swallowing up all the data they can get. They’re not the only company doing this, but they appear to be the most prominent — in part because of their high-profile clients.  In a 2016 speech, Alexander Nix, the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, unfurled the company’s methodology: “We’ve rolled out a long-form quantitative instrument to probe the underlying traits that inform personality,” he proclaimed. “If you know the personality of the people you’re targeting, you can nuance your messaging to resonate more effectively with those key groups.”  By “your message” he means whoever pays the company for its services. But so far the firm has only taken on Republican clients, with Ted Cruz and Ben Carson being the most visible. They also worked on behalf of 2016 pro-Brexit “Leave” campaign, mining online data and using it to target and persuade British voters.  So what are they doing with all that data?  Cambridge Analytica has built models that translate the data they harvest into personality profiles for every American adult — Nix claims to have “somewhere close to 4 or 5 thousand data points on every adult in the US.”  Their models are based on the psychometric research of Michal Kosinski, who in 2013 was still a PhD candidate at the University of Cambridge (hence the name “Cambridge Analytica”). Kosinski and his colleagues developed a model that linked subjects’ Facebook likes with their OCEAN scores. OCEAN refers to a questionnaire used by psychologists that describes personalities along five dimensions — openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism.  Cambridge Analytica has combined this social psychology with data analytics. They collect data from Facebook and Twitter (which is perfectly legal) and have purchased an array of other data — about television preferences, airline travel, shopping habits, church attendance, what books you buy, what magazines you subscribe to — from third-party organizations and so-called data brokers.  They take all this information and use it for what Nix calls “behavioral microtargeting” — basically individualized advertising.  Instead of tailoring ads according to demographics, they use psychometrics. It’s a simple idea, really. Rather than assuming that all women or African Americans or working-class whites will respond to the same message, they target individual voters with emotionally charged content — in other words, ads designed to tug on emotional biases.  The success of this approach hinges on the accuracy of the company’s psychological profiles. But how much can they know about someone’s psyche on the basis of a few tweets or likes? Quite a lot, apparently. In a 2016 profile for Das Magazin, a Zürich-based culture magazine, Kosinski talked about the predictive power of his model.  Here’s how the authors summed it up:  The strength of their [Kosinski and his Cambridge colleagues] modeling was illustrated by how well it could predict a subject's answers. Kosinski continued to work on the models incessantly: before long, he was able to evaluate a person better than the average work colleague, merely on the basis of ten Facebook ""likes."" Seventy ""likes"" were enough to outdo what a person's friends knew, 150 what their parents knew, and 300 ""likes"" what their partner knew. More ""likes"" could even surpass what a person thought they knew about themselves.  Combine this kind of predictive power with an army of bots and you’ve got a potent propaganda tool. As Woolley told me, “One person controlling a thousand bot accounts is able to not just affect the people in their immediate circle but also potentially the algorithm of the site on which their operating.”  Bots are even more effective, as they’re able to react instantly to trending topics on Twitter and Facebook, producing targeted posts, images, and even YouTube videos.  “The technologies can capture what people are thinking at a particular moment,” Albright told me, “and serve it back to them over and over again.” And with the benefit of psychographic profiling, he adds, they’re able to deliver “content on an individual basis on Twitter and Facebook feeds where people are being grabbed and pulled in certain directions through certain types of posts and stories.  “I’ve called it an emotional leash,” Woolley said.  There’s a lot we don’t know  We don’t know if Flynn actually passed any data to the Russians. Nor do we know if his numerous ties to Russia resulted in collusion.  We don’t know if the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russians to help their disinformation operation. We know only that there are many points of overlap. And if anyone in his campaign did coordinate with Russia, we don’t know if Trump himself was involved in any way.  We don’t know if the data produced by Cambridge Analytica ever found its way to Russians. And if it did, we don’t know for sure how it got there or how much it helped or if the company was aware of it.  We also don’t know how useful Cambridge Analytica’s work was to the Trump campaign. Researchers like Woolley told me that the company’s capabilities are a “bit overblown,” but we simply don’t know. We know only what they’ve admitted publicly about their methods and what they claim to be able to do.  One thing we do know is that data companies like Cambridge Analytica have changed things. Facebook is already under fire for allowing Russia to manipulate its algorithms during the 2016 election. And we’ve likely just scratched the surface in terms of how state actors are able to weaponize information online. The role of companies like Cambridge Analytica in these efforts remains something of a mystery, however.  In any event, no definitive evidence has emerged that connects Cambridge Analytica and the Trump campaign to Russia’s efforts to influence our election. What we’re left with, ultimately, is a ton of smoke and no fire. But if the ongoing investigations conclude that the Trump campaign did help Russia target voters, expect to hear more about Cambridge Analytica.  It’s entirely possible that such collusion could have occurred and the work of Cambridge Analytica had nothing to do with it; however, that would be strange, since targeting voters is precisely what the company was hired to do.",2.25,6,"[1.5, 2.0, 5.0, 0.5, 0.5, 4.0]"
844,2301,10,20,2017,2017-10-20,Fox News,"Hurricanes, wildfires hit construction industry hard","Before the devastation of California's fires and Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, a key segment of the economy, the construction industry, was struggling with a worker shortage.  Now the 1-2-3 punch of natural disasters near major metropolitan areas is expected to make building projects even more time consuming and expensive.  ""We've already got a very volatile, super pressurized, super stretched industry, and just having natural disasters just adds to the pressure,"" said Eric Holt, assistant professor at University of Denver's Franklin L. Burns School of Real Estate & Construction Management.  Labor is most pressing. It is projected that for every five retiring skilled tradespeople, only one is entering the industry, according to an Economic Impact Report commissioned by the Association of General Contractors.  THE LATEST: OFFICIAL: CALIFORNIA FIRE LOSSES TOP $1 BILLION  The industry lost hundreds of thousands of workers in the recession.  ""They moved into different industries, they wanted something more stable and so now that the housing is coming back, and we need all those people back, they're not here,"" Holt said.  He said employers are trying to make up for it by offering training, better pay and benefits. For example, the Colorado Homebuilding Academy is a nonprofit operating in industry-donated space. Builders and grants foot the $1,400 cost of Construction Skills Boot Camp for each student who pledges to go into construction.  Hairstylist Angie McKevitt is one student hoping to turn the experience into a new career.  ""(I) always wanted to learn more about construction, and this is time for a job change in my life,"" she said.  McKevitt meets one of several targets the industry is after -- administrators are hoping to get more women in the program. They are seeking high school graduates not bound for college, military veterans returning to civilian life and previous criminal offenders. The latter, because a steady, good-paying job has been shown to reduce recidivism.  The school expects to triple its number of graduates this year. Companies benefit with stream of workers, graduates who already have basic skills.  HURRICANE HARVEY CAUSED HOUSTON TO SINK  When it comes to supply, Holt says there will be ""opportunistic entrepreneurs."" People in one region may see an opportunity to buy plywood at $30 a sheet, throw it in a U-Haul to drive it to a hard hit area and sell it for $90. They may also move to a natural disaster areas to seek out work.  Oakwood Homes, which builds communities in Colorado and Utah, has its own manufacturing facility to try to keep costs down. The company, which expects to bring in close to a half a billion dollars in revenue this year, also keeps supplies stockpiled near sites.  Chairman and CEO Patrick Hamill says, ""With the two hurricanes that we just experienced, as well as even the fires in California, (we're) really worried about some availability.

Tesla (OTC: TSLA) has only made a profit in one quarter of its 14-year existence, and that was only due to selling federal and state tax credits to traditional auto manufactures and others that actually do make taxable profits.  Although Tesla’s $2.98 billion third quarter revenue slightly beat Wall Street analysts’ estimates, the company lost $671 million, or $2.92 per share. That was twice the-$336 million loss in the prior quarter, and set an all-time cash burn high of $16 million per day.  Breitbart News reported in early October that CEO Elon Musk had announced that Tesla Inc. had its “all-time best quarter” with record deliveries of 26,150 vehicles, including 14,065 Model S sedans; 11,865 Model X SUVs; and 220 Model 3 economy cars. That was considered a disappointment for Model 3 deliveries, and its stock sold off by 1 percent.  But Musk emphasized that through “physics-first principles,” Tesla would shape a new mode of industrial production to improve efficiency by “factors of 10 or even 100 times.” He said Tesla’s key advantage in building all-electric vehicles was limiting the number of moving engine parts to 20, versus up to 10,000 for internal combustion engines.  With investors reassured that Tesla was on track to ramp up to delivering 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week in the December quarter and 10,000 per week in the March quarter, Tesla’s stock traded up on big volume to an interim high of $362.55 on October 18.  But the stock opened at $301.15 per share on November 2 and has been trading down after Musk acknowledged on the company’s third quarter conference call that it is “difficult to predict” when the bottlenecks will be cleared in production of Model 3s. He said he did not expect to be at 5,000 Model 3 units a week until late March.  Musk tried to reassure shareholders that he is “leading from the front lines” to battle “production hell” delays. Tesla said the main problem holding up production of the Model 3s were production delays at Tesla’s $5 billion Gigafactory in Reno, Nevada, where Panasonic four-battery cell modules are automatically inserted into an aluminum-wrapped battery case. Musk referred to his Instagram post last week where he is having a late-night campfire with a couple of managers on the Gigafactory’s roof as a sign of his focus.  Musk did assign some blame for production delays on the Model 3 being more automated, compared to the company’s largely hand-built luxury Model S sedans and Model X SUVs. Musk stated that “bringing this level of automation online is simply challenging in the early stages of the ramp.”  But he failed to comment on Edward Niedermeyer’s brilliant October 30 report in the Daily Kanban industrial blog that Tesla did not give a purchase order to a major automated tooling supplier to develop two “Body in White” (BIW) transfer lines for the Model 3 early this year. Although car companies normally place fully-designed orders for BIW lines with at least a two-year lead time, and BIW manufacturers almost always assemble and test the line at their factories, Tesla asked for a 4-month delivery and wanted to expedite delivery by doing a risky “cold build” line layout and quality testing at Tesla’s factory.  Niedermeyer added that “disagreements between Tesla’s designers and engineers resulted in numerous revisions to the scope of the contract and eventually led Tesla to drop the second line from its purchase order.” The BIW vendor blamed Tesla’s high level of turnover in key positions, which Breitbart News has highlighted in the past. Without the second BIW assembly line, Tesla can never produce 10,000 units per week.  In another example of Tesla failing to have enough lead time to produce Model 3 units, Panasonic’s Chief Executive Kazuhiro Tsuga told Reuters that Gigafactory batteries are still being mostly made by hand. “This process (for battery packs) will be soon automated, and then the number of vehicles to be produced will rise sharply.” Tsuga declined to comment on how far Tesla Model 3 production is behind its targeted delivery schedule.",3.3,5,"[5.0, 2.5, 3.5, 2.5, 3.0]"
487,1871,10,11,2017,2017-10-11,Breitbart,Poll: Voters Support Gun Rights Over Gun Control After Vegas Attack,"A poll released October 11 shows that voters remain more supportive of gun rights versus gun control in the wake of the Las Vegas attack.  The poll, conducted by Politico/Morning Consult, found that 47 percent of voters supported gun rights versus 42 percent who supported gun control.  Politico reported the findings, which also showed that voters who supported Trump stand for gun rights over gun control by a margin of 48 percent to 46 percent.  This is not to say gun control is without its supporters, but Politico reports that support for “limiting gun ownership” is largely driven by Democrat voters. For example, 63 percent of Democrat voters support limiting gun ownership while only 25 percent believe protecting gun rights is more important. Republicans are just the the opposite with “70 percent [saying] it’s more important to protect gun rights, compared with 23 percent who say limiting gun ownership is more important.”  Support for gun control was also strongest among voters who do not have a gun their household. Twenty-seven percent of those without guns in their homes support gun rights over gun control while 66 percent of voters “with at least one gun in the household think it’s more important to protect gun rights.”  Despite these divides, Democrat support for gun control resulted in majority support for expanding background checks to private sales and banning gun purchases by persons on terror watch lists, even through the Vegas attacker passed background checks for his guns and was not on a terror watch list. Moreover, the poll found majority support for gun storage laws, a gun registry, and a three-day waiting waiting period for gun purchases. However, gun storage was not an issue in the Vegas attack and other attackers—like the Orlando Pulse attacker—actually passed a three-day waiting period for firearms. Empirical evidence proves that a firearm registry only leads to confiscation, just look at California for proof.  Other gun controls garnered support as well, proving once again the genius of our Founding Fathers in using the Second Amendment to shield gun rights from the tyranny of subjecting natural rights to a majority vote.

(Oliver Berg/dpa via AP)  BONN, Germany (AP) — Environmental activists protested at a German coal-fired power plant on Friday — the same day that Italy became the latest country to announce a deadline for ending its use of the heavily polluting fossil fuel.  Protesters projected images of Pacific islanders threatened by climate change onto the cooling tower of the lignite-fuelled power station in Neurath, in western Germany, along with the words “coal destroys our future.”  The visual display, organized by representatives of Pacific island nations and the environmental group Greenpeace, took place as diplomats from around the world are meeting in nearby Bonn to discuss implementing the 2015 Paris climate accord.  The German government claims to be a leader in the fight against climate change but has refused to set a date for phasing out the use of coal, which emits large amounts of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide when burned. Coal accounts for about 40 percent of Germany’s energy mix.  Several other countries, however, have set a cutoff date for coal, including Italy, which announced it will stop using coal for its national electricity needs by 2025.  Italy’s plan calls for investments of 175 billion euros ($203.5 billion) through 2030 in infrastructure, renewable energy and energy efficiency development. According to government statistics, coal provided 16 percent of Italy’s national electricity in 2015.  Italy’s new energy strategy calls for carbon emissions from energy use to decrease 39 percent by 2030 and 63 percent by 2050.  Coal has become a key issue at the Bonn climate talks. Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore told delegates there Friday that making the switch away from fossil fuels won’t be easy given the industry’s political clout, but that it makes both environmental and financial sense.  “It is insane to force taxpayers to subsidize the destruction of our civilization, and of course, the coal and gas and oil lobbies have a lot of political power,” Gore said. “They built it up over a hundred years, and they have the influence with politicians, not only in my country, but also in China, also in Japan.”  U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters Friday in New York that he will urge participants at Bonn conference to respond to the latest alarming data by further cutting emissions, helping countries respond to climate shocks and mobilizing the $100 billion promised to help developing countries.  He said recent reports send two messages: “accelerate climate action — and raise ambition.”  The 2015 Paris climate accord set a target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) — or 2 degrees at the most — by the end of the century.  Guterres pointed to new worrying data: The World Meteorological Organization reported that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reached new highs in 2016. A U.N. Environment Program report showed that greenhouse gas levels are likely to be so elevated in 2020 that reaching Paris targets for 2030 will be very hard to meet.  Guterres warned that the window of opportunity to keep temperatures to the 2-degree target “may close in 20 years or less — and we may have only five years to bend the emissions curve toward 1.5 degrees.”  “We need at least a further 25 percent cut in emissions by 2020,” he said.  Guterres also called for greater action by governments, businesses and citizens to combat climate change, and he announced he will hold a climate summit “to mobilize political and economic energy at the highest levels” in September 2019.  ___  Jordans reported from Berlin.

Republican leaders don’t seem to want a deal  After an initially supportive statement calling the Alexander-Murray legislation “a very good solution,” Trump seemed to turn tail and characterize the bill as a “bailout” for insurance companies.  Paul Ryan is opposed: House Speaker Paul Ryan also voiced opposition to the bill, and said “the Senate should keep its focus on repeal and replace of Obamacare” rather than on bipartisan deals.

The real deal may come later: The continuing resolution that funds the government expires in December, and it will take a bipartisan vote to extend or modify it. That, in theory, could be a time for bipartisan health legislation to end up folded into what’s going to be a big bipartisan package anyway.  The administration tested some new tax arguments  Republican tax reform legislation still lacks crucial details such as how many tax brackets there will be, what income thresholds the brackets will be pegged to, which deductions will be closed, and what will happen to the child tax credit, but while leaving such matters unresolved, the Trump administration did try out some new arguments.  Corporate tax cuts boost wages: On Monday, Kevin Hassett, head of the president’s Council of Economic Advisers, rolled out a paper purporting to show that middle-class wages would rise by $4,000 to $9,000 per year if the corporate tax rate is cut from 35 percent to 20 percent.

The critical question around taxes at this point is really congressional procedure and not the sales pitch. Will Senate Republicans do a temporary deficit-financed tax cut, or aim for a permanent one that’s paid for? Or will they change the Senate’s rules to allow for a permanent deficit-financed tax cut? Until a decision is made on that, everything else is essentially theoretical.  Nobody knows what’s happening with NAFTA  The ongoing process of renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement — a key campaign pledge that Trump hasn’t talked about much since Inauguration Day — has been an under-the-radar story in the United States but a much bigger deal in Mexico and Canada.

Democrat Ralph Northam brought in former Vice President Joe Biden for an event in Reston, an upscale community just outside Washington’s Capital Beltway.  Pence minced no words in drawing a clear distinction between Gillespie and Northam.  “Like Donald Trump, Ed Gillespie will put the safety and prosperity of the American people first,” Pence told a crowd of about 400 people, Politico reported.

Earlier in the day, Trump tweeted support for Gillespie, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee.  “The Democrats in the Southwest part of Virginia have been abandoned by their Party. Republican Ed Gillespie will never let you down!” the president wrote.  In Reston, Biden backed Northam – Virginia’s lieutenant governor -- before an audience of about 100 people.

1317,2916,11,2,2017,2017-11-02,Breitbart,Report: Russian Intel Officials May Be Charged in DNC Hack,"The Wall Street Journal cites “sources familiar with the investigation” in a Wednesday report claiming the Justice Department is close to charging six unnamed Russian government officials in last year’s reputed “hack” of the Democratic National Committee (DNC).  The Wall Street Journal claims the officials have been “identified” as being “involved” in the release of internal DNC emails showing systematic favoritism for candidate Hillary Clinton over rival Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). Separately from the leak, that narrative was given independent verification Wednesday in an upcoming book by interim-DNC Chairwoman Donna Brazile. She posits the DNC, in effect, turned over its operations to the Clinton campaign.  It is not clear from the reporting if the investigation referred to in the Wall Street Journal falls under Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office, but the story notes, “It is unclear if prosecutors will hold back filing charges until Mr. Mueller completes his investigation or wait to identify others who may have played a role in the DNC hack. Investigators believe dozens of others may have played a role in the cyberattack, the people said.”  The Special Counsel’s Office has seen a flurry of activity this week, revealing a serious 12-count indictment against one-time Donald Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort and his deputy, Richard Gates – unrelated to the 2016 campaign – and going public with the previously sealed guilty plea of a low-level campaign staffer for making false statements to the FBI.  The Wall Street Journal also claims, “U.S. intelligence agencies have attributed the attack to Russian intelligence services, but haven’t provided detailed information about how they concluded those services were responsible, or any details about the individuals allegedly involved.”  Omitted is the infamous – and now discredited – “17 intelligence agencies” claim.  Also missing was any mention of the July report of the Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS) group that claimed the leak could not possibly have been the result of a Russian hack. The validity of that study was called into question immediately upon its August publication by The Nation, and its accuracy would directly conflict with Wednesday’s Wall Street Journal report.  The six Russian officials are not expected to be in the United States or extraditable countries and the charges, it is implied, would be largely symbolic. Their issuance, however, would shed light on a narrative of Russian election interference that, so far, has remained effectively opaque.",2.3181818181818183,11,"[2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 1.5, 0.5, 5.0, 0.5, 2.5, 2.5, 3.0, 0.5]"

It’s daunting and frightening and it holds you back from taking action sometimes.”  Earlier this year, the New York Times reported that Huddy said O’Reilly pursued a sexual relationship with her in 2011 and that when she rebuffed his advances he tried to derail her career. Allegations included O’Reilly calling Huddy repeatedly, sometimes sounding as if he were masturbating, and after asking her to return a key to his hotel room, he appeared at the door in his boxer shorts.

The Hill reports that Reddit has officially appointed their first federal lobbyists according to disclosure firms obtained this week. The disclosure form shows that the company hired the Franklin Square Group in July to lobby the government on “Internet issues, including net neutrality and liability protections for online platforms.”  The “liability protections for online platforms,” part of the disclosure may refer to the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA) being pushed by Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH) which could see websites being held liable for any sex trafficking that takes place on their platform. Companies such as Facebook and Google have opposed the bill, pushing back against it due to worries that they may be held liable for actions of their users out of the companies control.  Reddit may also be interested in having representation within the government as it has currently not been decided whether or not Reddit will be included in investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election which social media companies Facebook, Google and Twitter have found themselves embroiled in. It was recently reported that Russian linked sources paid as much as $100,000 for approximately 3,000 political advertisements across Facebook in 2015 and 2016.  Sen. Mark Warner, (D-VA) the top Democrat sitting on the Senate Intelligence Committee, has previously voiced his fear that Reddit would be extremely vulnerable to Russian propaganda campaigns but there is yet to be any solid evidence revealed that the site has previously been used for Russian propaganda efforts. The Hill reached out to Reddit for comment on their new lobbyists but has yet to receive a response.  Reddit was pulled into the political spotlight in recent years with the rise of the websites Trump supporting community, The_Donald, which was reportedly censored by the website as their content was appearing too frequently on the front page. At one point, Reddit’s CEO Steve Huffman apparently considered banning the The_Donald entirely, “The United States is more divided than ever, and we see that tension within Reddit itself,” said Huffman in a statement, “The community that was formed in support of President-elect Donald Trump organized and grew rapidly, but within it were users that devoted themselves to antagonising the broader Reddit community.”  Huffman further wrote that he resisted pressure to ban The_Donald entirely, “More than anything, I want Reddit to heal, and I want our country to heal, and although many of you have asked us to ban the r/the_donald outright, it is with this spirit of healing that I have resisted doing so. If there is anything about this election that we have learned, it is that there are communities that feel alienated and just want to be heard, and Reddit has always been a place where those voices can be heard.”",1.0,1,[1.0]
896,2387,10,21,2017,2017-10-21,Breitbart,Gavin Newsom Asks Court to Allow ‘High Capacity’ Magazine Ban,"Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom is asking that a court order against a “high capacity” magazine ban be lifted so the ban can take effect in California.  A “high capacity” magazine ban was set to go into effect in California on July 1 but was blocked by U.S. District Judge Roger Benitez, who ruled that the ban could not survive the test of District of Columbia v. Heller (2008). Breitbart News reported:  Heller was a ruling which reaffirmed that Second Amendment rights are individual rights that the government is prohibited from infringing. Heller struck down a Washington, DC, gun ban — demonstrating that federal districts are barred from infringing gun rights—and in 2010, the McDonald v Chicago ruling affirmed that states are barred from infringing said rights as well.  The “high capacity” magazine ban in California was passed by a majority of voters via Proposition 63, but Judge Benitez noted that Heller is a reminder that the Constitution is in place to shield rights from “the tyranny of the majority.”  Newsom wants the Benitez order lifted so the ban can take effect.  According to the Los Angeles Times, Newsom said the ban will “help prevent the occurrence of high-fatality gun massacres, and … [will] reduce the bloodshed when these tragedies occur.”  Note that Newsom’s claim contains an admission that the ban will not stop “high-fatality” attacks altogether. Rather, it is yet another in a long list of California controls that is promulgated in the name of safety, only to result in diminished freedom. The loss of freedom would result from the fact that only law-abiding citizens would follow a “high capacity” magazine ban, like any gun law, and law-abiding citizens are the very people who are not misusing “high capacity” magazines to begin with.  This was not lost on Judge Benitez, who said he blocked the ban because its implementation would have meant “hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of otherwise law-abiding citizens [would] have an untenable choice: become an outlaw or dispossess one’s self of lawfully acquired property.”  AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

The move comes after mounting pressure on the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation. Until Friday, the agency said that the board would be given only a staff report summarizing the deal, as is routine when dealing with agency contracts. In a letter to board members Friday, agency chief executive Mark Hogan said the board members will now have access to the contract Monday afternoon. The vote is scheduled for Wednesday.  ""I have said many times this is a complex transaction and it is important to get it done right, both for the company and its investors, as well as WEDC, the state and our taxpayers,"" Hogan wrote. ""Given we are very close on the contract language, and given the size of the award, now is the appropriate time to make it available to you as board members.""  He said the review will happen in closed session and will be confidential. The contract will be made available to the public after it's signed.

She’s still as smart as me","The three most common questions I get asked about the Central Intelligence Agency are:  1. “How did you join the CIA?”  2. “No, I mean, why did they take you?”  3. “What was the training like?”  My answers are usually the same:  1. “Uh, I just got lucky.”  2. “Oh, yeah, I see what you mean … I guess they lowered the bar that year.”  3. “It was exciting, challenging and never boring … it was tough, you had to work like a dog.”  Like a dog. Anyone who has been through a long-term physically and mentally demanding training program knows what I’m talking about. Some make it, some don’t.  The CIA typically washes out an impressive number of recruits from each new class. Some can’t absorb the training fast enough, some realize they’re not suited for the agency. And occasionally – not very often – new recruits just can’t get excited enough to wag their tails.  I refer, of course, to Lulu the black Lab. The CIA announced on Twitter this week – and it was picked up by major media outlets hungry for the next spy bites dog story – that Lulu will not be continuing in her effort to be a CIA bomb dog.  The CIA’s latest washout entered the Fall 2017 K9 Explosives Detection Training program with high hopes and a little puppy head full of dreams. Lulu had passed all the preliminary tests. She excelled during the accelerated house-training course … learning quickly to only pee in the little areas where the trainers had spread classified documents on the floor.  Lulu started her training just like I started mine … full of excitement, nervous and eager for a belly rub. I remember sizing up the other recruits in my class, and suspect Lulu went through the same thing. Although, looking back on it, my classmates never introduced themselves by sticking their noses up anyone’s backside. That would come later as students worked to impress instructors.  My training lasted for a couple of years. As with Lulu and her puppy pals, my classmates and I needed a strict regimen of instruction mixed with constant exercises designed to reinforce the training. Our instructors were fair, firm and only occasionally did I get wacked in the nose with a rolled up newspaper. More often than not, positive reinforcement rather than a stern rebuke was the order of the day.  Lulu, according to credible sources with a solid track record of reporting, started the class well. But then, something happened. Maybe she began questioning her career choices. Perhaps she couldn’t reconcile the need for national security with the question of privacy and civil liberties. It could be that she just doesn’t like the smell of explosives.  Whatever her reason, the CIA let it be known the other day that Lulu was being let go. She reportedly lost interest in her training … sticking her nose in various canisters and noodling around cinderblocks and other materials just wasn’t interesting for her any longer. She was bored and that, frankly, is not a quality you’re looking for in a bomb dog.  Now some folks might accuse the CIA of puppy shaming. After all, why shine a light on Lulu’s shortcomings? Is it anybody’s business if Lulu can’t tell the difference between C4 and Silly Putty?  Well, first of all, there’s no shame in Lulu not making the cut. The fact that she was accepted into the course to begin with makes her a very good dog. My dog Hendricks, a 100 pound English Golden Retriever with a brain the size of a chickpea, couldn’t detect a small thermonuclear warhead unless it was covered in pork chops.  Hendricks is the world’s finest dog, but he’s nobody’s idea of a rocket scientist. He’s still trying to figure out who’s a good boy. I think he’s worried he may never get the answer to that question.  Lulu was accepted into the CIA, for crying out loud. That makes her at least as smart as me. So what that she didn’t finish the course. After a few weeks of sniffing stuff, I think she demonstrated remarkable maturity in walking into the chief’s office and announcing her early retirement.  Second, I’m glad to see the CIA occasionally letting the public peek into its world … it helps to humanize an organization full of wonderful, patriotic and dedicated humans. And dogs.  Best of all, the story has a happy ending. Lulu’s trainer eagerly adopted Lulu. She now spends her days lying on a rug, chasing squirrels, eating treats and getting petted. Which, if you think about it, is a fine way to spend your retirement. Good girl.",1.8,10,"[2.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 2.5, 1.5, 2.0, 3.5, 3.0, 1.5]"

Trump and his government supposed priorities are nothing else but an anti-immigrant and white-supremacist agenda that don’t solve anything … need clean act now.”  Lenka w/ @WomenBelong: I'm here representing imm moms who will not let Trump tear down our childrens' dreams while separating our families. pic.twitter.com/Ad7GjuA2de — America's Voice (@AmericasVoice) October 11, 2017  Mendoza was welcomed to the podium by Todd Schulte, a Democratic political activist who is president of FWD.us, a lobbying group formed by Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Venture Capitalists and software CEOs. Nine of the group’s 15 founders are investors who would gain from cheaper white-collar labor and a larger population of customers in the United States.  Schulte hosted the event to showcase Democrats’ opposition to President Trump’s new immigration principles, which balance business’ demands for more workers and customers against Americans’ worries that they and their children will be unfairly outsourced, sidelined and ignored amid mass immigration.  In his October 8 letter to Congress, Trump said:  These findings outline reforms that must be included as part of any legislation addressing the status of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients. Without these reforms, illegal immigration and chain migration, which severely and unfairly burden American workers and taxpayers, will continue without end. Immigration reform must create more jobs, higher wages, and greater security for Americans — now and for future generations. The reforms outlined in the enclosure are necessary to ensure prosperity, opportunity, and safety for every member of our national family.  Instead of urging compromise, Schulte’s speakers upped their demands, saying they want an amnesty for young ‘dreamer’ illegals plus an amnesty for their parents, to be delivered immediately and without any compromises, such as the improved border defenses sought by a supermajority of Americans.  The illegals were invited to speak alongside leadership speakers at the event, including the House Democrats’ leader, Rep. Nancy Pelosi — who described Trump’s immigration proposals as “trash” — and the chairwoman of the Democrats’ Hispanic caucus.  The escalating demands and aggressive rhetoric from Schulte’s illegals were much sharper than the prior soft-spoken claims by Democratic leaders who say they want to protect ‘dreamers’ from deportation. That soft, poll-tested language has been damaged by simple questions from reporters who have shown the bigger-than-expected scale, cost and demographic impact of what started out as supposedly modest demand to save 690,000 DACA illegals from repatriation.  The new language from Mendoza included a claim that immigration-enforcement officers of “terrorizing” people.  “Congress can solve today the young people’s situation without using them as an excuse to deport their mothers or spending more money terrorizing people that live near the border,” said Mendoza, an unskilled migrant who cleans houses for a living.  “Many people think ending DACA or approving the Dream Act will only affect young people, but this is not true. This is something that effects all of us – mothers, our families and all of our communities,” Mendoza said.  A second illegal, Ingrid Vaca, said she arrived in the United States from Bolivia in 2000. “I came to this country with dreams to protect my sons and to give them a better future,” she said in heavily accented English, adding: I would not let anything stand in their way.”  “I am here today to say that as a strong woman and loving mother of two #DACA recipients, I will continue to fight for a #CleanDreamAct!” pic.twitter.com/5pDraoR5f5 — United We Dream (@UNITEDWEDREAM) October 11, 2017  Vaca continued:  DACA away was taken away by Trump and his racist advisors, Jeff Sessions and Steven Miller … We will not let racist men negotiate with our kids’ lives … We will not allow our families to be broken up … A mother’s love is stronger than the racists from the White House.  The escalated demands from the illegal aliens are compatible with Schulte’s goals, which primarily include a defeat of the popular RAISE Act, authorized by Goerge Sen. David Perdue and Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton.  The RAISE Act is a problem for Schulte’s investors because it would halve the inflow of new customers and workers, and –worse — it would prevent the investors from pushing Congress to pass the so-called “staple” green card proposal.  The proposed “staple” visa program would allow foreign students at U.S. universities to receive a green card stapled to their graduate degree. It is very popular among business groups because it would create a huge wave of salary-cutting white-collar competition in the skilled job sectors where young Americans hope to earn a good living. The salary-cutting competition would be intensified by the government’s offer of the very valuable prize of citizenship to foreign graduates who take jobs sought by the 800,000 Americans who graduate from college each year with skilled degrees in business and medicine, engineering, architecture and science, technology, math and chemical engineering.  But Schulte’s investors won’t get their staple proposal — or any increase in white-collar H-1B outsourcing — if Trump and the voters pressure Democrats to accept Trump’s popular immigration principles in exchange for a limited amnesty.  The third illegal alien introduced by Schulte was Luis Condorimay, who migrated to the United States from Peru at age 13 and earned a 2016 degree in chemical engineering.  An amnesty for just younger illegals is unacceptable if it does not also include their parents, he insisted. “This is just not something I can do. Would you accept a law where you protect yourself … but hurt your father and mother?”  He also spoke against any border and enforcement upgrades, and described the illegal-alien communities as the victims:  There are politicians in power right now who want to deport my father and my mother, who want to separate me from my little sister. Those politicians are the same ones who killed DACA and put the lives of immigrants on the line. They want now to use my life and the life of my sister, who also has DACA, as a bargaining chip to get a wall built on the Southern border and to militarize our border, to increase the number of immigrants agents in our cities and continue to terrorize and separate our families. They say they have heart for us, they say they understand our pain, but all they really want to do is hurt our families and continue to sperate us as they have done for the past many years … I ask you all here today to put yourself in our shoes, just for one moment: Haven’t we suffered enough already?”  “We need [amnesty] now, we need it right now because too many families have already been separated,” he said.  Four million Americans turn 18 each year and begin looking for good jobs in the free market.  But business groups have used their political power to tilt the labor market in their favor, via the federal policy of importing 1 million consumers and workers each year. The government also hands out almost 3 million short-term work permits to foreign workers. These permits include roughly 330,000 one-year OPT permits for foreign graduates of U.S. colleges, roughly 200,000 three-year H-1B visas for foreign white-collar professionals, and 400,000 two-year permits to DACA illegals. Universities employ roughly 100,000 foreign guest workers.  That Washington-imposed economic policy of mass-immigration floods the market with foreign labor, spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. It also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids’ schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions.  The cheap-labor policy has also reduced investment and job creation in many interior states because the coastal cities have a surplus of imported labor. For example, almost 27 percent of zip codes in Missouri had fewer jobs or businesses in 2015 than in 2000, according to a new report by the Economic Innovation Group. In Kansas, almost 29 percent of zip codes had fewer jobs and businesses in 2015 compared to 2000, which was a two-decade period of massive cheap-labor immigration.  Americans tell pollsters that they strongly oppose amnesties and cheap-labor immigration, even as most Americans also want to favor legal immigrants, and many sympathize with illegals.  Because of the successful cheap-labor strategy, wages for men have remained flat since 1973, and a growing percentage of the nation’s annual income is shifting to investors and away from employees.",5.0,1,[5.0]
268,1591,10,3,2017,2017-10-03,Breitbart,Equifax Given Huge IRS Fraud-Prevention Contract Following Massive Security Breach,"The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has awarded Equifax a $7.25 million fraud-prevention contract following the company’s massive security breach which affected over 140 million consumers.  According to Politico, “The IRS will pay Equifax $7.25 million to verify taxpayer identities and help prevent fraud under a no-bid contract issued last week.”  “The credit agency will ‘verify taxpayer identity’ and ‘assist in ongoing identity verification and validations’ at the IRS, according to the award,” Politico’s reported. “The notice describes the contract as a ‘sole source order,’ meaning Equifax is the only company deemed capable of providing the service. It says the order was issued to prevent a lapse in identity checks while officials resolve a dispute over a separate contract.”  In September, it was reported that Equifax had been the victim of a large cyberattack, which potentially left over 140 million consumers’ personal information vulnerable.  Following the attack, Equifax blamed the attack on a single employee who failed to implement a patch. However, according to Tech Crunch, “a patch for that vulnerability had been available for months before the breach occurred.”  The company faced further controversy following the discovery that Equifax’s Terms of Service included a clause in their security assistance website which barred consumers from being able to sue the company before they removed it following consumer backlash.  It was also revealed that the company had been encouraging consumers to visit the wrong security website, a fake, which could have easily been used as a phishing scam and taken more information.  Several lawmakers have criticized the IRS’ decision, including Rep. Suzan DelBene (D-WA) and Earl Blumenauer (D-OR), the latter of which claimed, “I was initially under the impression that my staff was sharing a copy of the Onion, until I realized this story was, in fact, true.”  Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) also criticized the IRS over the contract in separate comments.  “In the wake of one of the most massive data breaches in a decade, it’s irresponsible for the IRS to turn over millions in taxpayer dollars to a company that has yet to offer a succinct answer on how at least 145 million Americans had personally identifiable information exposed,” declared Sen. Hatch to Politico.  In his own comment, Sen. Wyden added, “The Finance Committee will be looking into why Equifax was the only company to apply for and be rewarded with this. I will continue to take every measure possible to prevent taxpayer data from being compromised as this arrangement moves forward.”  In a statement, the IRS defended their decision, declaring, “Following an internal review and an on-site visit with Equifax, the IRS believes the service Equifax provided does not pose a risk to IRS data or systems.”  “At this time, we have seen no indications of tax fraud related to the Equifax breach, but we will continue to closely monitor the situation,” they proclaimed.  Last month, the U.S. Justice Department reportedly “opened a criminal investigation into the sale of Equifax stock by high-ranking executives just days before the company revealed they had been the subject of a massive data breach,” while Equifax CEO Richard Smith retired from his position a week later.

1577,3264,11,9,2017,2017-11-09,Media Matters,Watch MSNBC's Ali Velshi debunk Republican talking points about tax cuts,"ALI VELSHI (HOST): We've seen it under the Reagan administration, we've seen it in the UK recently. When you lower tax rates on corporations, you don't see any corresponding wage increase in the United States. That's the bottom line. There's just no evidence of that actually happening. So I'll tell you what happens, if you are a company or you’re wealthy in America and you lose the estate tax and you lose the AMT and you get the corporate tax rate reduced from 35 to 20, those are absolute gains. there is no question that’s going to happen if one of these bills passes. But if you're middle class you know you'll get an average $1,200 gain and everything else is a hope. You hope economic growth will hit 3%, you hope the companies will take the savings that they have in taxes and somehow build factories that'll employ more people and not outsource. So you know what I am saying, if you're middle class in America, this is on a wish and prayer. If you're rich, this is a gift.  REP. RODNEY DAVIS (R-IL): I don't think so. As a matter of fact, you and I must have a distinct disagreement on what the American economy and small businesses throughout this country are going to do when we put more money into their pockets and allow them to invest more money in their businesses. They are going to buy more equipment, this manufacturing and --  VELSHI: Why, sir? Why? Congressman, there's no shortage of capital in this country for businesses --  DAVIS: Because I've seen it happen --  VELSHI: Interest rates are as low as they've ever been. Money is everywhere to be had. Companies are not expanding, not because of the shortages of capital or money or tax rates are too high. You know why companies expand? When there's demand. I just don't know where you are going to think this all of a sudden demand is going to pop up when you don't give the people the break, you give the companies the break. Companies have a lot of money.  DAVIS: We believe we are giving -- you look at the individual tax bracket changes that we've put forth and we are focusing completely on the middle income and lower income families. They're going to be able to ensure that their taxable income continues to go down, and that means also a fair, flatter, and simpler tax code to allow them to put more money in their pockets and participate in their local economies and help their Main Street businesses. And I do believe that companies in our Main Streets are going to continue to invest and grow in our communities to be able to help create the jobs that we know are going to be a part of this package once it passes.  VELSHI: I am going to put it on the screen. You won't be able to see it but I'll tell what you it is. This is the Reagan tax cuts when corporate tax rates went from 46% to 34%, wages fell for five straight years by as much as $3,000 adjusting for inflation. There is just no evidence that tax cuts result in higher wages. I'd be happy to study anything you give me that tells me otherwise. I feel like you are working off of talking points, sir.",3.25,2,"[1.5, 5.0]"

On Friday in Tokyo -- ahead of her father's upcoming Asia trip -- that meant advocating for women and minorities in the working world and speaking out against sexual harassment.  The first daughter used her appearance at the World Assembly for Women summit to champion female and minority contributions in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM).  “Female and minority participation in STEM fields is moving in the wrong direction,"" Ivanka Trump said, according to Reuters. ""We must create equal participation in these traditionally male-dominated sectors of our economy.""  But she also addressed the torrent of sexual harassment and misconduct allegations back home, involving figures from business, media, entertainment and government.  ""All too often, our workplace culture fails to treat women with appropriate respect,"" she told her Japanese audience about American society, Agence France-Presse reported. ""This takes many forms, including harassment, which can never be tolerated.""  Perhaps in deference to Ivanka Trump, Tokyo's Metropolitan Police Department deployed an all-female security team to guard America's first daughter, the Asahi Shimbun reported. Instead of bulky body armor, the women officers sported black suits.  Ivanka's speech came just days before President Trump and first lady Melania Trump were scheduled to arrive in Japan for a three-day visit beginning Sunday. The tour also will include stops in South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines.  In her speech, Ivanka also touted her father’s push at home for tax reform, Reuters reported.  “We are seeking to simplify the tax code, lower rates, expand the child tax credit, eliminate the marriage penalty, and put more money back in the pockets of hard-working Americans,” she said.  Ivanka's Tokyo appearance put significant distance between herself and a report by Newsweek that she had used a private email account to communicate with the U.S. Treasury Department while employed by the White House.  The magazine cited information obtained via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request made by nonprofit organization American Oversight.  The email data also revealed that Ivanka and husband Jared Kushner were invited to a weekly “Economic Principals Lunch” hosted by Trump’s top economic adviser Gary Cohn in his office.Other attendees included Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.  During the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump consistently criticized opponent Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was U.S. secretary of state with the Obama administration.",3.090909090909091,22,"[0.5, 2.5, 2.5, 3.5, 3.0, 3.0, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 3.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 2.5, 4.0, 1.5, 3.5, 2.5, 3.0, 5.0, 0.5, 5.0]"
1347,2946,11,3,2017,2017-11-03,Fox News,Trump: DOJ must do 'what is right and proper' and investigate Hillary Clinton,"President Trump opened up on Democrats with both Twitter barrels from high in the sky Friday, exploiting fractures in the rival party after top operative Donna Brazile revealed insiders plotted to steal last year's presidential primary from Bernie Sanders.  ""Bernie Sanders supporters have every right to be apoplectic of the complete theft of the Dem primary by Crooked Hillary!"" Trump tweeted from Air Force One, as he headed off on a 13-day tour of Asian nations.  It was part of a mid-morning Twitter barrage in which Trump called for his own Justice Department to probe a range of scandals involving the Democratic Party and his vanquished 2016 presidential rival, Hillary Clinton.  “Everybody is asking why the Justice Department (and FBI) isn’t looking into all of the dishonesty going on with Crooked Hillary & the Dems,” Trump tweeted early Friday. “New Donna B book says she paid for and stole the Dem Primary. What about the deleted E-mails, Uranium, Podesta, the Server, plus, plus…”  In excerpts released Thursday from an upcoming book, Brazile, a longtime party stalwart and Clinton confidante, confirmed longstanding suspicions that the Democratic National Committee she once headed worked with Clinton to ensure she won the party's presidential primary over Sanders, the Vermont senator who built a huge following with his blend of Democrat politics and socialism.  ""I always felt I would be running and winning against Bernie Sanders, not Crooked H, without cheating, I was right,"" Trump tweeted.  Brazile's explosive charge has sent shockwaves through the party.  “I had promised Bernie when I took the helm of the Democratic National Committee after the convention that I would get to the bottom of whether Hillary Clinton’s team had rigged the nomination process, as a cache of emails stolen by Russian hackers and posted online had suggested,” Brazile wrote in a book excerpt first published in Politico Magazine. “By Sept. 7, the day I called Bernie, I had found my proof and it broke my heart.”  The proof, according to Brazile, was a joint fundraising agreement document between the DNC, the Hillary Victory Fund and Hillary for America. It had been signed in August 2015, four months after Clinton announced her candidacy and a year before she officially secured the nomination over Sanders.  “The agreement –signed by Amy Dacey, the former CEO of the DNC and Robby Mook, with a copy to Marc Elias—specified that in exchange for raising money and investing in the DNC, Hillary would control the party’s finances, strategy, and all the money raised,” Brazile wrote. “Her campaign had the right of refusal of who would be the party communications director, and it would make final decision on all the other staff.”  DONNA BRAZILE: I FOUND 'PROOF' THE DNC RIGGED THE NOMINATION FOR HILLARY CLINTON  Even before Friday morning's tweetstorm, Trump reacted to the allegations against Clinton on Thursday night on “The Ingraham Angle.”  “It’s illegal, number one, and it’s really unfair to Bernie Sanders,” Trump said. “I’m not a Bernie Sanders fan, although I must say I got a lot of his votes when he was thrown out. Many of those people voted for me because of trade because I agreed with him on trade…But that was, I thought that was terrible.”  ""Pocahontas just stated that the Democrats, lead by the legendary Crooked Hillary Clinton, rigged the Primaries! Lets go FBI & Justice Dept.,"" Trump tweeted again. 'Pocahontas,' when used by the president, is typically in reference to Sen. Elizabeth Warren.  In an interview with Jake Tapper on CNN Thursday, Warren, D-Mass., was asked whether she believed the DNC was rigged, to which the senator simply responded, ""Yes.""  But on Friday, Trump took the opportunity to add the Brazile bombshell to a list of allegations and situations that he wants his Justice Department to investigate, including her “deleted E-mails” and “the Server,” pointing back to the months-long Clinton email investigation.  Trump also referred to “Uranium,” alluding to the controversial Obama-era Uranium One deal. The 2010 deal concerns the sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to Russia’s Rosatom nuclear company. The U.S. was involved because the sale gave the Russians control of part of the uranium supply in the U.S. Clinton, at the time, was secretary of state.  TRUMP CALLS DNC PRIMARY-RIGGING 'ILLEGAL,' SLAMS 'FAKE' DOSSIER IN FOX NEWS INTERVIEW  Trump also referred to “Podesta,” though it is unclear if he was referring to Democratic lobbyist Tony Podesta, or his brother, Clinton’s longtime confidante and 2016 campaign manager John Podesta.  This week, Tony Podesta stepped down from his lobbying firm, which was co-founded with his brother John, in the wake of special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe expanding to question Podesta’s Foreign Agent Registration (FARA) filings, and whether he was in violation of that law.  A spokesperson for Podesta told Fox News that they were compliant with their FARA filings and were “fully” cooperating with Mueller’s team.  The president tweeted again, moments later, underscoring the need for a federal probe.  ""....People are angry. At some point the Justice Department, and the FBI, must do what is right and proper.

1385,2994,11,4,2017,2017-11-04,Breitbart,"Bannon: Trump, Stewart Voters Going to Win Virginia Governorship for ‘Bush Guy’ Gillespie","Following headliner Stephen K. Bannon, executive chairman of Breitbart News, populist-nationalist 2018 U.S. Senate candidate Corey Stewart addressed the Remembrance Project National Conference in Washington, DC, Saturday.  The event, at the capital’s famous Willard Hotel, featured a “who’s who” of leaders in the fight against illegal immigration, including headliner Bannon, Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton, and Colorado gubernatorial candidate Tom Tancredo, in Remembrance Project’s largest annual event to honor Americans killed by illegal alien crime and the “angel families” they left behind.  Stewart, speaking afterwards with Breitbart News, called Bannon “the most powerful political figure in the United States today.” He agreed with Bannon’s assessment of the political winds in the country. “There’s momentum in the country to destroy political correctness, to do something about illegal immigration, to build the wall, and enforce immigration laws,” he said.  Virginia gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie made “Mara Salvatrucha,” or MS-13, a focal point of his campaign as Tuesday’s election draws near. Fueled by illegal aliens, the transnational criminal gang has become a gruesome feature of the once placid Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, DC.  The issue, that has come to define the race in the last month, is no news to Stewart, who extensively raised the alarm on MS-13 and the refusal of Gillespie opponent Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam to endorse banning the “sanctuary city” policies that fuel transnational criminal organizations in other states in his primary campaign.  Just Thursday, the Department of Justice unveiled indictments for murder against four more alleged MS-13 members from Anne Arundel County, Maryland, just over the state line from the Northern Virginia communities, about which both Gillespie and Stewart have raised concerns.  “MS-13 is not just a Northern Virginia problem. It’s not just in Northern Virginia and tidewater,” Stewart told Breitbart News on Saturday. “It is spreading down the [Interstate] 81 corridor and is becoming a statewide issue … It’s an issue that will drive not only conservatives but independent voters who are concerned about it.”  Stewart, who lost to Ed Gillespie by the narrowest of margin’s in June’s GOP primary, thought his one-time opponent has done well for himself by making illegal immigration-fueled crime the central issue of his campaign. “As he’s moved to the right,” Stewart told Breitbart News of Gillespie, “as he’s embraced the issues of protecting historical monuments and cracking down on illegal immigration, I don’t think it’s a coincidence his poll numbers have improved dramatically.”  The left, including the incumbent Democrat, arch-Clinton ally Terry McAuliffe, has tried to shame Gillespie’s populist turn as “racist.” Most prominent is the response of leftist PAC “Latino Victory Fund,” placing in circulation an ad showing a Gillespie supporter with a confederate flag on his pickup trying to run down Muslim and Latino children. The ad, now conclusively linked to the Northam campaign, has been called “vile” and “despicable” by the Washington Post editorial board.  Corey Stewart called the ad “by far the dumbest move by the left in the last year.”  Bannon, in his own address, broadly agreed with Stewart’s understanding of the path of the Virginia governor’s race. When he mentioned Gillespie’s name, cheers of “Corey! Corey!” erupted from the crowed. “For the Senate in ’18,” was Bannon’s reply.  “That’s a horse race now,” Bannon said. “Gillespie, what was he? Eight, ten points down two weeks ago, two and a half weeks ago?”  Gillespie is now running even or ahead in many polls.  “If Gillespie … a Bush guy … wins, and I do believe that Gillespie’s going to pull this thing out,” Bannon continued, “it will be because of the underlying message of Corey Stewart and what he believes in, and the Trump voters in Virginia who are gonna turn out!”  Stewart was similarly optimistic about the effect of the momentum Gillespie has stirred up with his embrace of Virginia’s populist energy. “A Gillespie win or a narrow loss means there will be a lot more national money and resources going into Virginia in 2018,” he told Breitbart News.",2.3333333333333335,3,"[3.5, 3.0, 0.5]"

He warned that the United States could wind up facing an economic collapse akin to that in Venezuela, adding that Republicans in the House and Senate had not demonstrated that they possess “the intellectual understanding of the dangers posed by these deficits and accumulated debt.”  Mr. Trump, who has called himself “the king of debt,” may be setting the tone.  During his presidential campaign, he insisted that he could eliminate the national debt in eight years, even as he promised to protect Social Security and Medicare, programs that are projected to consume an ever larger share of federal spending as the country’s population ages.  After Mr. Trump struck a deal with Democrats on a short-term debt limit extension, Representative David Schweikert, Republican of Arizona, asked, “In this entire discussion, how many members have you heard, how many from the White House said, ‘We’re in the middle of a demographic crisis that’s going to crush us in just a few years; let’s get to work on it’?”  He left unsaid the answer to his question: Not many.  The change in tone on fiscal matters has been swift. This spring, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, asserted that the tax overhaul needed to be revenue neutral, citing the nation’s debt and invoking Mr. Trump’s Democratic predecessor.  “We added an enormous amount of debt during the Obama years,” Mr. McConnell said.  Now, Republican lawmakers are betting that economic growth will fix the nation’s fiscal woes with no pain and a lot of gain.  “The only way we’re going to solve our long-term debt and deficit issue to allow the federal government to have the revenue it’s going to need to fund all these promises made is with strong — and I mean strong — economic growth,” said Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin and a member of the Senate Budget Committee. “You’re not going to achieve that with an awful tax system.”  Mr. Kennedy, another member of the budget panel, said Americans have to have faith.  “If we do it right, then the economy will be stimulated appropriately and tax revenues will go up and the deficit won’t increase,” Mr. Kennedy said. “Now, I can’t prove to you that that will happen.

The Pew Research Institute presented four points for evaluation by respondents. They addressed the rise of wholly self-driving vehicles, the replacement of human workers with automated equivalents, a computer that could autonomously decide who to hire for a given job, and even robotic caregivers.  According to the survey, 76% fear that job automation will increase inequality — the same percentage as those who strongly oppose allowing robots to make hiring decisions. 75% believe that the jobs lost to machines will not be adequately replaced. 72% are worried about prospects in a future dominated by robots, while just 33% are enthusiastic.  Respondents were split on driverless cars, with only 54% in favor of the idea. 56% would not take a ride in one, given the choice. 30% believe that they will result in an increase in fatal accidents.  Aaron Smith, author of the research, pointed out a stark divide between the attitudes of white and blue collar workers:  White collar workers see tech as something positive that helps them get ahead and has improved their opportunities for career advancement, giving them agency to do their jobs better, make more money and get promotions. When we asked the same questions of working class folk, you don’t get the same sense that it’s something that is helpful to them or improves access to career opportunities.

34,202,8,31,2017,2017-08-31,Associated Press News,AP Explains: Harvey shines light on flood insurance program," The massive flooding Harvey has caused in Texas and Louisiana comes as Congress weighs renewing a federal flood insurance program that continually pays out more than it takes in through premiums, potentially leaving taxpayers on the hook for $24.6 billion and counting.  The National Flood Insurance Program expires Sept. 30. Congress is likely to reauthorize the program before then because failure to do so would disrupt coastal real estate markets. If the program expires, current policies would remain in effect, but no new policies could be issued.  The question for lawmakers when they return from the August recess next week is whether to pass a short-term extension that keeps the program running largely as-is for the next few months or pass a long-term extension that makes more drastic changes and puts the program on firmer financial footing.  Here’s a look at the program and how some lawmakers are looking to change it.  ___  HOW DID THE PROGRAM START?  Congress created the National Flood Insurance Program in 1968 to reduce the growing expense the federal government assumed after natural disasters to help repair damaged homes and businesses.  One of the key goals of the program was to get cities and counties to reduce the risk of flooding and better protect buildings from flood waters.  If the communities agree to undertake such steps and join the program, their residents and businesses can then purchase federal flood insurance to protect themselves from losses. When communities don’t participate, it means their residents and business owners cannot buy federal flood insurance and are thus ineligible for a federally backed loan.  ___  WHO GETS COVERAGE THROUGH THE NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM?  Homeowners who live in areas that have a 1 percent chance of being inundated by flood waters in any given year must purchase flood insurance as a condition of having a federally backed mortgage.  About 5 million policies are in effect for individuals and businesses. The policies generate about $3.3 billion in premiums annually. Still, studies have shown that many Americans living in these particularly vulnerable flood zones bypass the requirement to buy flood insurance. A 2006 government study found that compliance was lowest in the Midwest and highest in the West.  ___  WHERE IS THE PROGRAM WORKING WELL?  The Federal Emergency Management Agency estimates that the flood-control efforts communities have undertaken as a result of their participation in the program prevents nearly $1.9 billion in flood losses annually.  ___  WHERE IS THE PROGRAM NOT WORKING?  A program that is supposed to pay for itself is clearly not doing so. A spending bill enacted after Superstorm Sandy authorized the program to borrow up to $30.4 billion. The damage from Harvey will potentially lead FEMA to hit that borrowing level. If it does, FEMA would eventually need authorization from Congress before borrowing any more money to pay out claims.  The growing debt level is why lawmakers such as Rep. Jeb Hensarling, the Republican chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, say the program is unsustainable. Hensarling calls Harvey a “wake-up call” that an overhaul is needed to stave off a taxpayer bailout.  Still, it’s a difficult balance. If premiums rise too much to make the program self-sustainable, it discourages people from living and opening businesses in the more flood-prone regions of the country.  ___  WHAT CHANGES ARE BEING CONSIDERED BY CONGRESS?  Hensarling’s committee has already passed a series of bills that would increase premiums by 8 percent annually for certain policies instead of the current 5 percent, among other changes.  The panel has since reined that in to a 6.5 percent increase that will be phased in gradually, a move that helped attract support from influential trade groups representing home builders and real estate agents. The House legislation would require FEMA to raise collection rates for a reserve fund by 1 percent each year to help pay future claims. The legislation also seeks to boost the private flood insurance marketplace, clarifying that flood insurance policies written by private carriers satisfy the mandatory purchase requirements that come with obtaining a federally-backed mortgage. Hensarling said he believes more flood insurance offerings from private companies would bring about the kind of competition that could make policies more affordable.  The top Democrat on the committee, California Rep. Maxine Waters, said that the fee and premium increases being pursued were still too much in her view and she encouraged House colleagues to “consider the thoughtful, bipartisan process in the Senate as an alternative to this anti-homeowner bill.”  There are competing bills in the Senate, with one bipartisan measure capping premium fee increases at 10 percent and suspending the interest payments the program makes to the U.S. Treasury for the money it has borrowed over the years.",4.5,1,[4.5]
1074,2652,10,26,2017,2017-10-26,Associated Press News,New screenings begin for passengers on US-bound flights," In this Wednesday, March 22, 2017 file photo, an Emirates plane taxis to a gate at Dubai International Airport at Dubai International Airport in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Long-haul carrier Emirates says it is starting new screening procedures for U.S.-bound passengers following it receiving ""new security guidelines"" from American authorities. (AP Photo/Adam Schreck, File)  DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — New security screenings for all passengers on U.S.-bound flights began on Thursday, with airlines worldwide questioning flyers about their trip and their luggage in the latest Trump administration decision affecting global travel.  However, confusion still remains about the new regulations, which come at the end of a 120-day period following the United States lifting a ban on laptops in airplane cabins affecting 10 Mideast cities. The new regulations cover all the 2,100 flights from around the world entering the U.S. on any given day.  Some airlines said they had received permission to delay implementing the new rules until January.  At Dubai International Airport, the world’s busiest for international travel, long-haul carrier Emirates began questioning passengers about their luggage, liquids they were carrying and where they were coming from. Passengers also had to have their carry-on bags searched, along with their electronics.  Emirates declined to discuss the new procedures in detail on Thursday. On Wednesday, it said it would conduct “passenger pre-screening interviews” for those traveling on U.S.-bound flights in concert with other checks on electronics.  Elsewhere, things did not appear to be going so smoothly. In China, an official in the Xiamen Airlines press office, who would only give his surname as Qiu, said that the airlines received a “demand” about the new U.S. regulations and planned “to take some security measures, including security safety interviews from today on.”  “We’re not going to interview all passengers, but focus on those with a certain degree of risk when checking the passengers’ documents on the ground,” he said, without elaborating.  An official with the Eastern Airlines publicity department said that she saw media reports about security safety interviews but didn’t have immediate details on what her company was doing. An official at the Beijing Airport press center would only say: “We always strictly follow relevant regulations of the Civil Aviation Administration when conducting security checks.” Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity under regulations.  At Air China, the country’s flag carrier, an official who only gave his surname, Zhang, said it would comply.  “We will meet the demands from the U.S. side, but as for the detailed measures (we will take), it is inconvenient for us to release,” he said.  South Korea’s Transport Ministry said that the United States agreed to delay implementing the new screening for the country’s two biggest carriers, Korean Air Lines Co. and Asiana Airlines Inc., until next year on condition they deploy staff at boarding gates to monitor travelers.  Royal Jordanian, based in Amman, also has said it would introduce the new procedures in mid-January.  Other airlines with U.S.-bound flights at Seoul’s Incheon International Airport brought in as many as seven extra staff Thursday to question passengers under the new rules but there were no major delays, airport spokesman Lee Jung-hoon said.  Singapore Airlines passengers may be required to “undergo enhanced security measures” including inspection of personal electronic devices “as well as security questioning during check-in and boarding,” the carrier said on its website.  Other carriers who announced the new regulations on Wednesday included Air France, Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., the airlines of Germany’s Lufthansa Group and EgyptAir.  In Hong Kong, passengers described some of the questions they were asked.  “They asked me if I packed my own bag, where I packed it from, where I came from, they looked at my itinerary, verify where I was, who I was, from where I came from,” said Fran Young, who was travelling to Los Angeles.  Some showed displeasure.  “It’s a little inconvenient, I kind of just want to get my printed ticket and then just go inside,” passenger Gavin Lai said. “I don’t want to wait on people to interview me like that. So it’s a little annoying.”  U.S. carriers also will be affected by the new rules. Delta Air Lines said it was telling passengers traveling to the U.S. to arrive at the airport at least three hours before their flight and allow extra time to get through security. United declined to comment, while American did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  In March, U.S. officials introduced the laptop ban in the cabins of some Mideast airlines over concerns Islamic State fighters and other extremists could hide bombs inside of them. The ban was lifted after those airlines began using devices like CT scanners to examine electronics before passengers boarded planes heading to the U.S. Some also increasingly swab passengers’ hands to check for explosive residue.  The laptop ban as well as travel bans affecting predominantly Muslim countries have hurt Mideast airlines. Emirates, the region’s biggest, said it slashed 20 percent of its flights to the U.S. in the wake of the restrictions.  ___  Associated Press writers Yu Bing in Beijing, Kelvin Chan and Josie Wong in Hong Kong, Anna Johnson in Phoenix and Youkyung Lee in Seoul contributed to this report.  ___  Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellap .

(L'Osservatore Romano/Pool Photo via AP)  VATICAN CITY (AP) — The Latest on Pope Francis’ call with International Space Station (all times local):  4:10 p.m.  International Space Station Commander Randy Bresnik has told Pope Francis that his greatest joy working on the orbiting lab is being able to “see God’s creation maybe a little bit from his perspective.”  Francis and Bresnik spoke on Thursday during a phone call between the Vatican and six crew members currently in the space station.  The pope asked the crew — three Americans, two Russians and an Italian — what gives them the most joy in their work.  Bresnik, a U.S. Marine who flew combat missions during the Iraq war, said what strikes him is that in space there are “no borders, there is no conflict, it’s just peaceful.”  The astronaut said: “People cannot come up here and see the indescribable beauty of our Earth and not be touched in their souls.”  He added: “You see the thinness of the atmosphere, it makes you realize how fragile our existence here is.”  ___  4 p.m.  Pope Francis has praised Russia’s “humanistic and religious” understanding of the power of love, during a phone call with Russian, American and Italian crew members of the International Space Station.  During the Thursday hookup, Francis asked the crew how they understand Dante’s verse that love is the force that moves the universe.  Russian cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin replied by noting that he had been reading St. Exupery’s “The Little Prince” while in space and was taken by the child’s understanding of love.  He told Francis “Love is the force that gives you strength to give your life for someone else.”  Francis praised his response, saying “It’s clear you have understood the message that St. Exupery so poetically explained, and that you Russians have in your blood, in your humanistic and religious tradition.”  ___  2 p.m.  The cold-call pope is setting his sights set heavenward by ringing astronauts aboard the International Space Station.  Pope Francis’ hookup Thursday marks the second papal phone call to space: Pope Benedict XVI rang the space station in 2011, and peppered its residents with questions about the future of the planet and the environmental risks it faced.  Italian astronaut Paolo Nespoli was aboard the orbiting lab for that call and will be on hand to chat with Francis, who considered a career in chemistry before becoming a priest.  Francis’ papacy has been marked by his concern for the environment, as well as his firm belief in the compatibility of faith and science. It was a fellow Jesuit, the Rev.

A second Royal Order was issued to relieve Minister of Economy and Planning, Adel al-Faqieh, from his duties, and the appointment of Mohammed Al Tuwaijri as Minister of Economy and Planning.  According to a Royal Decree issued by King Salman on Saturday the anti-corruption committee is chaired by the Crown Prince with the membership of: Chairman of the Monitoring and Investigation Commission, Chairman of the National Anti-Corruption Authority, Chief of the General Audit Bureau, Attorney General and Head of State Security.  As Saudi analysts were quick to point out, the purge by the Saudi King means that King Abdallah’s last remnants (Riyad firmer gov. & head of Nat. Guard); media moguls; SAGIA & financial policy officials have been purged.  As Bloomberg notes, changing the head of the National Guard, an institution that’s been controlled by the clan of the late King Abdullah, “is not like changing the minister of oil,” said Kamran Bokhari, a senior analyst with Geopolitical Futures and a senior fellow with the Center for Global Policy. “I wouldn’t be surprised if this leads to greater fissures within the royal family.”  Arabiya adds that King Salman also issued sacking and replacement orders for Admiral Abdullah bin Sultan bin Mohammed Al-Sultan, the Commander of the Naval Forces, is to be terminated and be retired; his replacement is Vice Admiral Fahd bin Abdullah Al-Ghifaili, to be promoted to the rank of admiral and be appointed as Commander of the Naval Forces.  Additionally, Minister of Economy and Planning Adel al-Faqieh was replaced by Mohammed al-Tuwaijri, SPA said, quoting a royal decree. Commander of the Saudi Navy, Abdullah al-Sultan, was replaced with Fahad al-Ghafli. The king also replaced Minister of Economy and Planning Adel Fakeih withMohammad Al Tuwaijri, his deputy.

In mid-September, I spoke with some prominent advocates, and they had two primary fears as the September 30 deadline to extend CHIP's funding drew closer:  The funding authority would be allowed to lapse. The CHIP negotiations would be complicated by more partisan issues like Obamacare.  Now both fears have come to pass.  vox-mark VoxCare Vox's email explaining the biggest news in health care, edited by Sarah Kliff Subscribe By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy. For more newsletters, check out our newsletters page  CHIP's funding expired on October 1, and the program has now gone four weeks without being extended. States are on the clock: The Georgetown University Center for Children and Families reported that six states expect to run out of money by the end of the year or by early January.  They are planning contingencies. Some can keep covering kids through their Medicaid programs, though they will have to find the money to pay their share. Other states could send children to the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces to buy coverage. But the fear is that some number of young Americans will become uninsured if CHIP is not extended before states run out of funds.  You would think that would motivate Congress to act. But instead, Republicans and Democrats in the House are digging in, feuding over — just as CHIP advocates feared — Obamacare and other programs.  ""This is a huge mess,"" Bruce Lesley, president of First Focus, told me. ""We have the perfect storm for kids to lose coverage.""  The problem is offsets — spending cuts to pay for CHIP's funding for the next five years. Congress needs to find about $8 billion in savings.  House Republicans proposed cutting Obamacare's public health fund, cutting the grace period for Obamacare enrollees who fail to make premium payments, repealing the law's Independent Payment Advisory Board, and making some smaller cuts to Medicare and Medicaid as their plan for offsets.  Democrats balked, as you might expect, and the two sides had agreed to go back into negotiations. A vote in the House would wait, with the hopes that a compromise could be reached.  But on Thursday, according to the Hill, House Republican leaders announced that the chamber would vote on its CHIP bill next week — and it doesn't sound like there was a bipartisan breakthrough.  ""Only yesterday I was told Democrats said they don't want to do anything and we should just go forward,"" House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) said. ""That is not the way this place should work.""  So it sure sounds like a partisan bill is coming out of the House, and that's a huge problem. The CHIP legislation needs 60 votes in the Senate, which will require some Democratic buy-in.  Sens. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Ron Wyden (D-OR) had reached their own agreement on extending CHIP, but they never said how they would pay for it. They still haven't.  Meanwhile, the House is stuck in this offsets battle, apparently at an impasse.  ""The March of Dimes is deeply distressed that the House is moving forward on a vote that is likely to result in a partisan vote on CHIP,"" Cindy Pellegrini, who oversees federal policy at the March of Dimes, said in an email. ""We are urging both parties to continue negotiations with the goal of reaching a bipartisan agreement on this critically important program.""  What's particularly maddening is the two parties don't actually disagree about CHIP itself. The fight is over Obamacare and entitlements.  ""GIven that CHIP funding is less than one-half of 1 percent of mandatory outlays, they could find bipartisan agreement on the offsets without too much trouble I believe,"" Joan Alker at Georgetown told me, adding it was ""unfortunate"" that the House was moving forward with partisan offsets.  This is exactly what CHIP advocates had feared for the past few months. Now, four weeks after the deadline, there is still no resolution in sight to get this program that covers 9 million of America's children funded again.  Chart of the Day  States fall short with medication-assisted treatment for exiting prisoners. The Pew Charitable Trusts has a big new report on health care in US prisons. There is a lot to unpack here, but this stuck out to me: Most states don't provide medication-assisted treatment for substance abuse for prisoners upon reentry. That is in spite of the evidence that providing the medications helps prevent relapses for individuals leaving prison, Pew said.

One current and three former female members of Congress tell The Associated Press they have been sexually harassed or subjected to hostile sexual comments by their male colleagues while serving in the House. For years Bono endured the increasingly suggestive comments from a fellow lawmaker in the House. But when the congressman approached her on the House floor and told her he’d been thinking about her in the shower, she’d had enough. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Leading lawmakers are calling for mandatory training and other steps to prevent sexual harassment in Congress as the national spotlight on gender hostility in the workplace falls on Capitol Hill.  The calls from House Speaker Paul Ryan and others follow a series of news reports about women staffers and lawmakers experiencing harassment and sexual advances on the job. The Associated Press reported Friday on the experiences of one current and three former female lawmakers, who said they had fended off unwanted advances, sexual comments and, in one case, physical contact from a male colleague in Congress. The issue was already in the national spotlight because of the sex assault allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein and a growing list of boldface names in entertainment and the media.  On Friday, Ryan sent lawmakers a letter urging them to undergo sexual harassment training and make it mandatory for their staffs.  “Any form of harassment has no place in this institution. Each of us has a responsibility to ensure a workplace that is free from discrimination, harassment, and retaliation,” wrote Ryan, R-Wis. “We can and should lead by example.”  House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi called for passage of Democratic-sponsored legislation that would require anti-harassment training, enhance anti-retaliation protections for staffers who report harassment, and streamline dispute resolution. The recent focus on the issue has made clear that Congress’ tendency to self-police has resulted in lax rules, a patchwork of policies that vary from one office to another, and a complaints clearinghouse lodged in an Office of Compliance that requires a lengthy counseling and mediation period — and that many staffers have not even heard of.  Pelosi said all that needs to change.  “I think we are at a tipping point in our country,” the California Democrat told The Associated Press. “For a long time the Congress was a place where every congressional office had its own rules. ... The system needs to be changed.”  The House Administration Committee, which oversees the operations of the House, also announced plans to convene a hearing Nov. 14 focused on training, policies and mechanisms in place to guard against and report sexual harassment.  In the Senate, New York Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand, who went public several years ago with accounts of inappropriate comments from male senators, also announced legislation on the issue. Gillibrand’s bill would streamline the reporting process within the Office of Compliance, remove the current mediation requirement and give interns the same resources as full-time staff.  “Congress should never be above the law or play by their own set of rules. The current process has little accountability and even less sensitivity to victims of sexual harassment,” Gillibrand said.  GOP Rep. Mary Bono told AP she once confronted a male colleague on the floor of the House after he made repeated suggestive comments, including telling her he’d thought about her in the shower. The behavior stopped, but the lawmaker remains in the House, she said.  Rep. Linda Sanchez described being propositioned repeatedly in years past by one lawmaker who still serves, and ogled and groped by a second who’s since left the House. Former Rep. Hilda Solis disclosed repeated come-ons from a lawmaker, but declined to go into detail, while former Sen. Barbara Boxer described a years-ago incident at a hearing where a lawmaker made a sexually suggestive comment about her from the dais that the committee chairman seconded.  The female lawmakers declined to identify the men they were talking about, and did not report the incidents, with a couple of them noting it was not clear where they would have lodged such a complaint.  On Friday, additional female lawmakers offered public comments on the situations that can result in an environment that is only 20 percent women and still beholden in some ways to out-of-date traditions.  Rep. Cheri Bustos, D-Ill., said she has asked friends and colleagues in the House whether they knew of any woman who had advanced in their careers without being sexually harassed. “Without exception, they don’t know of anybody,” Bustos said. “We are all talking about it because it’s rampant. It’s absolutely rampant.”  As to whether she herself had been harassed by any fellow member, Bustos said: “It depends on how you want to define harassment.”  “How I’ve chosen to handle it is I just sort of dismiss it and I don’t give it another thought,” Bustos said. “I hope what happens out of all of this news coverage is it changes some people’s behavior as far as comments they make, or if it’s worse than that. I hope something good comes out of it.”  ___  Associated Press writers Kevin Freking and Matthew Daly contributed to this report.",3.375,4,"[4.0, 5.0, 1.5, 3.0]"

Could America?,"On the October 3 episode of The Weeds, Sarah Kliff, Ezra Klein, and Matt Yglesias discuss the recent mass shooting in Las Vegas and gun control policy changes that have worked to dramatically lower suicide and homicide rates in other countries.  Ezra opens the show by describing American policymakers’ now-predictable response to every mass shooting in the country, calling it “a bit of kabuki theater.”  “What you tend to have is Democrats saying, ‘Hey, listen, this keeps happening, we should do something about it.’ And as a way of showing that Republicans are completely and utterly unreasonable on this issue — which is true — they propose policies that would not actually do that much about the underlying problem, but Republicans still say no to even those policies,” he says.  Later Ezra, Sarah, and Matt examine Australia, a country that instituted radical reforms after a 1996 mass shooting in a tourist town called Port Arthur that left 35 people dead and another 28 injured. In the aftermath of that shooting, the Australian government introduced a program that offered to buy back people’s guns.  Through that program, the government was able to get rid of about 650,000 guns. But as Sarah notes, the program went further still, introducing a ban on automatic and semiautomatic weapons, putting in new licensing requirements, and making people wait 28 days before they purchased a gun.  “It cost half a billion dollars; it was funded by raising taxes,” Sarah says. “It feels absurd, imagining a proposal in the US to raise taxes to fund this suite of policies. It seems like something you wouldn’t even start with here in the US.”  The proposal worked, with suicide rates in Australia dropping about 57 percent after the reforms were implemented, and homicide rates dropping 47 percent, according to studies by Harvard researchers.  Ezra commented on the fact that Americans tend to talk about gun control policies whenever there is a mass shooting, even though these tragedies actually account for a low percentage of total gun deaths:  One way in which taking a lot of these guns off the streets would be helpful is not just in preventing these kinds of mass shootings, but in preventing everyday suicides, which are in America very, very gun-related and very successful. In America, we have an even worse gun problem. We’re not talking about solutions of anything near this scale, and so we are getting terrible, terrible results with these continuous deaths, continuous mass shootings, continuous suicide problems. And it is always worth saying, this is a choice, it is a policy choice we would make — every day we choose to continue on in this world is a day we are choosing this world. We know there are ways to choose a different pathway, and we are just as a country deciding not to take them.  Show notes:",3.0,1,[3.0]
942,2444,10,23,2017,2017-10-23,Vox,So you’ve learned you’ve got a “pitifully” low IQ. How worried should you be?,"The past few years have seen an important shift in popular understanding of IQ. Dismissive slogans like ""IQ just measures how well you take tests"" have been replaced by a growing understanding of how IQ is real, partially hereditary, and predictive of important life outcomes.  Scientific sources like Nature argue that ""what most people know about intelligence must be updated,” and popular media including Vox itself reports on the ""mountain of research showing that it's a genuinely powerful predictor of your health, prosperity, and well-being.”  IQ denialism seems to be going the same way as climate denialism — complete with overwhelming scientific consensus on one side — and it's about time. But people's concerns about this subject are understandable. Given the role intelligence plays in our society, any number that purports to rank it — rightly or wrongly — is going to touch on a lot of issues close to our self-worth as human beings. Some people with high IQs have always hoped that makes them better than everyone else; other people with low IQs have always worried they might be worse. On a subreddit dealing with psychology and IQ-related issues, I see posts like this one:  This may be completely silly, and it's not something I'm proud of, but given the amount of weight that JBP has given to the predictive powers of IQ, I'm too scared to do a test and find out what it is. It reminds me of the question, ""if there was an envelope with your death date on it, would you read it?"" I don't like the deterministic nature of what my future holds, as I feel it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy if my IQ checks out low. Especially as what I want to do in life requires a lot of abstraction and creativity, and it leans heavily on one's mentality. If my IQ checks out as low, that'll be one more obstacle in the road to overcome, and I just don't want to invite that.  Or like this:  Hey everybody. I recently did an IQ test and scored 83. I'm really bummed out about this because [University of Toronto psychology professor] Jordan Peterson has mentioned multiple times that IQ is the biggest predictor of success. Also I spend my spare time doing things like reading, watching these and other types of educational videos. Now that I realise I'm so far under average —it really hurts. I don't really know the point of this post, I guess I'd just like some thoughts on this because I'm too ashamed to tell anyone else.  Or this:  When I was 16, as a part of an educational assessment, I took both the WAIS-IV and Woodcock Johnson Cognitive Batteries. ... I never got a chance to have a discussion with the psychologist about the results, so I was left to interpret them with me, myself, and the big I known as the Internet — a dangerous activity, I know. This meant two years to date of armchair research, and subsequently, an incessant fear of the implications of my below-average IQ, which stands at a pitiful 94. ... [I told myself:] stop trying to fit into intellectual shoes that are too big for you. This is your station in life. Accept that it is so statistically improbable that you will not contribute anything useful in STEM-related areas, you might as well minimize your opportunity cost.  These people are really hurting. If their concerns were accurate, then they would just have to learn to live with them. But I think they aren't. There's a middle ground, where people can admit IQ is scientifically useful for discovering statistical truths about society, but remain skeptical of its ability to judge individuals. For one thing, casual IQ testing isn't a great way of measuring individual intelligence. For another, even an accurate measure of individual intelligence can only make statistical predictions, not ironclad prophecies.  In official studies, IQ tests correlate very well with other IQ tests, the same IQ test repeated later on, and other tests of intellectual ability like the SAT. For example, IQ scores and SAT scores tend to correlate at around 0.7, a very impressive match. But I surveyed readers of my blog on their IQs and SAT scores. I told them to only report their scores on real professional tests — none of those internet IQ tests you get to from flashing banner ads with pictures of Einstein's face on them. I got about 500 data points. And the correlation was only about 0.3: far lower than it was supposed to be.  First — though least importantly — lots of IQ tests given outside labs are less than rigorous  Why? SATs are taken in standardized conditions. But it would make sense if people taking my survey got less accurate IQ results than the ones in the official studies. Some may have gotten less-than-kosher tests. Others might have gotten tests given by harried underqualified school counselors who had to rush to finish before lunch.  Others might not have tried their hardest; still others might have been sleep-deprived, or overcaffeinated, or undercaffeinated, or hungover. Some probably took it when they were too young for it to really count — IQ doesn't stabilize until late adolescence. Still others might have taken the test in ideal conditions, received an accurate result, and then forgotten what it was over the years. A few might just be lying. Again, none of this is surprising. Breaking news: Random people haphazardly testing something do worse than trained scientists formally measuring that thing, more at 11.  But these are the kinds of IQ tests those people like the commenters quoted above mean when they complain about their own IQ scores. None of them were in formal studies. None of them have given the sort of information that formal studies would need to make anybody take them seriously. Their scores probably aren't completely useless. But they're probably more like the scores that correlate at 0.3 with SATs than the ones that correlate at 0.7. (Also, intellectuals who are really concerned about their IQ and complain about their unexpectedly low scores are a heavily self-selected sample.)  These problems affect even the best of us. Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman talked about getting a 124 on the only IQ test he ever took. 124 is plenty bright — but Feynman was one of the greatest scientists of the 20th century; 124 is about 30 points off the lowest remotely plausible value. Scott Aaronson writes about his own similar experience taking an IQ test at age four and getting a 106 — right about average. Aaronson is a computer science professor studying the intersection of quantum mechanics and computational complexity. Nobody believes 106 is a remotely accurate measure of his intellect. He writes:  [I]f you want to know, let’s say, whether you can succeed as a physicist, then surely the best way to find out is to start studying physics and see how well you do. That will give you a much more accurate signal than a gross consumer index like IQ will —and conditioned on that signal, I’m guessing that your IQ score will provide almost zero additional information.  This isn't to say true scientific genius can't be measured by IQ. Someone formally IQ tested a group of eminent physicists and found IQs in the 150s and above — exactly what you would expect from a bunch of geniuses. The difference between them and Feynman and Aaronson is that the physicists in the sample were tested in adulthood in a formal scientific study, and Feynman and Aaronson are working off half-remembered IQ tests of unclear quality they took in school. If you took some half-remembered IQ test in school and heard you got a 106, then good news: For all you know, you too might have the ability to be a professor of quantum physics.  Even highly elite occupations include people with a broad range of IQ scores  But fine. Suppose you take all of that to heart, you carefully seek out the best and most reliable IQ tests, you take them after age 18 when IQ is most stable, you take multiple tests to double- and triple-check, and you find that you really, definitely, no doubt about it, have a low IQ. Now can you be miserable and self-hating? No. IQ predicts a bunch of things like income and success in various fields, but prediction is not prophecy. You have a somewhat reduced chance of high attainment, but you shouldn't take it as a death sentence.  Consider the gender pay gap. We know that men, for whatever reason, tend to earn more money than women. But we also know that some men are very poor and some women are very rich. Being a woman gives you a disadvantage but doesn't doom you. The same is true of having low IQ. Being a man gives you a leg up, but doesn't guarantee success; the same is true of high IQ. IQ correlates with income at about 0.2 to 0.3, about the same level as parental socioeconomic status. If you're low-IQ, you're less likely to succeed to the same degree that a kid from a poor family is less likely to succeed. But kids from poor families do sometimes succeed — Bill Clinton and Steve Jobs being famous examples.  We can both acknowledge that as a society we're depressingly bad at social mobility and truthfully tell individual poor kids that with enough luck and effort they can have a shot at success. It isn't just that people can compensate for their low IQ with hard work. They can, but it's not just that. It's that IQ is a very noisy measure of all intellectual talents averaged together, and some people with unimpressive general IQs can still be extremely talented in particular fields. Even such a stereotypically intellectual pursuit as chess only correlates with IQ at 0.24. (Though note that there may be limitations to that study — restriction of range — since it was done only on high-level players.)  Former chess champion Garry Kasparov had an IQ of 135 — high, but not so high that there wouldn't be dozens of people ""smarter"" than him at any decent college. No doubt Kasparov studied very hard — but so does everyone in high-level chess. He just had chess talent way higher than his IQ would have predicted — and this is exactly what we'd expect from the modest correlation between these two variables. Here's a chart of average IQ for various occupations, taken from this paper:  The chart perfectly demonstrates how IQ is both statistically reliable and individually unreliable. On average, intellectually demanding occupations like college professors have higher IQs than less demanding occupations like janitors. But individual janitors are sometimes higher-IQ than individual college professors. And almost every profession draws from a wide range of IQs. The average professor is pretty smart — but a nontrivial number have below-average IQs. Like Kasparov, they probably have some areas where their natural talent greatly exceeds what their IQ would predict — and like Kasparov, they probably supplemented that by working really hard.  This kind of thing matters not just because people worry about their IQ, but because a lot of the most controversial results in social science look kind of like this. Pay gaps associated with race, gender, family of origin, socioeconomic status, and education give some groups a statistical leg up beyond others. More controversially, there's recently been debate over more fundamental gender differences, and new results constantly come out about the genetic basis for various skills and problems.  Whatever direction these findings end up going in, one of the best ways to prevent them from becoming toxic and depressing is to remember that statistical tendencies apply only weakly to individuals — or, in more conventional terms — we should be wary of stereotyping. The problem with stereotypes isn't that they're never true, it's that they take a weak statistical effect and try to apply it to particular individuals. IQ is a real thing — some people really do have higher intelligence than others — but any attempt to use this to make predictions about individuals will fail more often than it will be worth it.

689,2093,10,16,2017,2017-10-16,Vox,This year’s economics Nobel winner invented a tool that’s both brilliant and undemocratic,"Richard Thaler, of the University of Chicago, just won the Nobel Memorial Prize in economics for his contribution to behavioral economics — the subfield known for exploring how psychological biases cause people to act in ways that diverge from pure rational self-interest.  Policymakers are more likely to know him for a different reason. Together with his co-author, Harvard Law’s Cass Sunstein, Thaler is responsible for developing and popularizing the notion of “nudges” as a policy tool. Over the past decade, policymakers around the world have taken up Thaler and Sunstein’s ideas, setting up government nudge units and other programs intended to guide people toward choices that are in their best interests. Nudging has become fashionable.  Nudges can be used by both businesses and government to shape the behavior of employees, customers, and citizens. A classic nudge would be when a company automatically enrolls employees in a decent 401(k) plan — but lets them opt out of contributing, if they wish. The non-nudging status quo would require the employees to actively decide to sign up for a retirement plan. Studies have demonstrated that opt-out framing leads to higher enrollment.  Thaler and Sunstein argue that nudging is a win-win. Unlike traditional regulation, it doesn’t force people to make choices that they don’t want to make. Yet unlike a “laissez faire” approach it doesn’t assume that people should be left to make their own choices free of outside interference. Instead, their approach structures choices so that people are going to be nudged into making the choice that is probably best for them. In Thaler’s description:  if you want to get somebody to do something, make it easy. If you want to get people to eat healthier foods, then put healthier foods in the cafeteria, and make them easier to find, and make them taste better. So in every meeting I say, “Make it easy.”  So what’s not to like?  The problem — as Carnegie Mellon’s Cosma Shalizi and I have discussed elsewhere — is that government-by-nudging amounts to a kind of technocracy, which assumes that experts will know which choices are in the interests of ordinary people better than those people know themselves. This may be true under some circumstances, but it will not be true all of the time, or even most of the time, if there are no good opportunities for those ordinary people to voice their preferences.  Traditional forms of democratic policymaking rely on expertise too, but they have better correction mechanisms than nudgeocracy, since people who are sufficiently angry at a particular rule may have the incentive to complain and organize against it. Nudgeocracies, in contrast, are insulated from the feedback that would help them get things right.  This is even clearer if we call nudgeocracy by another name. Chris Hayes has written on Twitter about what he describes as the “hassleocracy” — the tendency to make something a hassle, so that fewer people will do it. Hayes was writing about the ways that Republicans make it harder for many groups to vote — mandating voter ID’s, and the like — but his description applies just as aptly to insurance companies doing everything they can to stop you from filing claims, or magazines that make it very easy to subscribe, but require you to notarize, and sign a form in triplicate, with the asservations of seven witnesses in red ink, if you want to stop the subscription from automatically self-renewing. (Thaler and Sunstein briefly discuss that example.)  Structuring choices to make things that you want people to do easy, and things that you don’t want them to do look like hassle carries over to contexts very different from the benevolent paternalism that Thaler favors.  Behavioral economics has inspired new approaches to policymaking  Nudgeocracy is a natural spin-off of Thaler’s economic arguments. Departing from standard microeconomics and game theory, behavioral economics takes it for granted that real-life decision-making is flawed in systematic ways, and that people often do not recognize what is in their best interest. (And even when they do know, they may find it hard to exercise appropriate self-restraint to make the right call.)  These insights lead to very different policy prescriptions than traditional economics. If you believe that human beings are perfectly rational, you can leave them alone to make the choices that will best satisfy their needs and self-interest. If, in contrast, you believe that human beings’ ability to know and act upon their interests is flawed, then you may want to help them make the choices that are best for them (so long as you are a benign administrator), even if those are not the choices that they would make unaided.  However, you face a potential ethical problem. By deciding what is good for people, rather than letting them decide for themselves, you take away some of their autonomy. You also run the risk of being wrong. Perhaps the choice that you think is best for the majority of people is obviously wrong for some minority of them.  This is why Thaler and Sunstein opt for nudging rather than benevolent dictatorship — or, less dramatically, for a system of governance in which legislatures pass laws designed by technocrats that force people to do the “right” thing. You do not compel people to make the right choices. Instead, you set up their choices so that they will find themselves guided to make the “right” choice unless they have strong alternative preferences. Creating a default option, as in the 401(k) example, is one option.  All of this sounds innocuous and even compelling, given that even neo-classical economists admit, when they are forced to, that human beings are not perfect calculating engines.  The “choice architect” does not always know best  Indeed, there are many circumstances under which nudges are a good idea. But the fad for nudgeocracy has hidden implications. Thaler and Sunstein describe the philosophy that underlies nudging as “libertarian paternalism” — libertarian because it lets people make the choices that they want to, paternalist because it provides them with a father’s guiding hand. Behind nudgeocracy lies the assumption that daddy knows best.  For Thaler and Sunstein, daddy is a “choice architect” — a skilled and intelligent technocrat who uses good data, good social science and his own intelligence to figure out what people would really want to do, if only they were as smart and well informed as the choice architect.  The problem is that daddies — consider those stern yet kindly men who smoke pipes and deliver shopworn aphorisms in in deep and manly voices — may have good intentions but don’t necessarily know best at all. They themselves may not have good information about what their charges want, what they should want, or how their charges will respond to nudges. Their understandings of their underlings or users may be skewed by preconceptions or poor information.  In one study, a power company tried to “nudge” its customers into consuming less energy, by telling them how their power consumption compared to their neighbors, and telling power hogs that they had room to improve. The nudge worked as intended for environmentalist Democrats, but non-environmentalist Republicans instead took it as license to increase their power consumption.  Of course, the choice architect has tools to try to remedy misinformation and misperceptions. Sometimes Thaler and Sunstein suggest that the choice architect can figure out what people should choose by simple introspection — “Libertarian paternalists would like to set the default by asking what reflective employees … would actually want.” Sometimes, they argue that the choice architect can carry out experiments, varying choices to see what consequences they have for human behavior. Choice architects could also turn to other sources of information such as surveys, or focus groups.  It is not clear, however, that choice architects will get good information from any of these sources. After all, choice architects are almost by definition going to be political, social, or business elites, and people are very often unforthcoming to those who can control their choices, fearing retaliation if they say the wrong thing.  Even when people provide honest information, it is not clear that the choice architects will have much incentive to listen to them if they say things that the choice architects don’t want to hear. Thaler and Sunstein do not really talk about whom the choice architect is supposed to be responsible to, perhaps because they want to talk both about the private sector (in which the architect must ultimately be responsible to owners or shareholders), and the public sector (in which the architect is a bureaucrat, and therefore responsible, directly or indirectly, to politicians). This means that they have little to say about the role of accountability in ensuring that choice architects accept new information, where it is available, and use it well.  Hard-and-fast rules can lead to democratic pushback. Technocratic “nudges” may not.  The above is another way of saying that nudgeocracy has a big weakness: It is not very good at receiving and incorporating feedback. Thaler and Sunstein have a lot to say about how choice architects can provide better feedback to ordinary people, but they have little to say about how ordinary people can provide feedback to choice architects. This is hard to see if your starting point is economics. While markets provide all kinds of feedback, standard micro-economic models assume that market actors have complete information over all the possible ways that other actors might respond to them; from that perspective, the idea of a genuinely unexpected response is a big stretch.  It is much easier to understand if you start instead by comparing nudgeocracy to traditional democracy. If “libertarian paternalism” sounds oxymoronic, so too does the way that traditional democracies run: through coercion. A democracy is a society in which the choices of a majority of citizens are binding on everyone else. These choices may be made directly or indirectly, and through a variety of mechanisms. The makeup of the majority may also vary, but what does not vary is that the choices are binding — those in the minority are forced to abide by them. This is why democracies are coercive — and why some libertarians dislike them. You do not have the option not to pay taxes; nor can you opt out of Social Security.  There are never-ending debates over the benefits and disadvantages of democracy. However, relatively little attention is paid to the informational advantages that coercion provides in a genuinely democratic setting.  Imagine that you live in a democratic system that imposes some new rule that requires you to do something that you don’t want to do — say, wear a seatbelt in your car. This rule will be visible to you, since you will be punished if you break it. If you are very unhappy with this rule, you can use your democratic voice. If you can persuade enough of your fellow citizens, you can then push to have the rule overturned.  That’s a natural feedback mechanism. Democratic coercion may sound like a contradiction in terms, but it builds a feedback loop through which suboptimal rules can get fixed.  Nudgeocracy, in contrast, lacks such a loop. First of all, the rules governing choice are likely to be unobtrusive. Much of the time, people won’t even be aware that they are being guided to a particular choice. In contrast to what happens in a coercive regime, people will be less likely to know to complain, or to mobilize against choice architectures that guide them to decisions that aren’t the best decisions they could make. Even when they do complain, it is not clear that their complaints will make a difference, since the choice architects might or might not be publicly accountable.  Of course, even the best democracies are not always responsive. (Notoriously, it is easier to mobilize against rules that have high costs for a small number of actors — like anti-pollution rules for power plants — than rules that have low costs for a very large number of actors.) Nonetheless, the closer that political systems approach true democracy, the more responsive to the public they are going to be. Nudgeocracy, even in its ideal form, lacks such accountability, and instead relies on a variety of more or less adequate technocratic substitutes.  In short, we may expect that bad laws and regulations — “shoves,” we might say — will generate protest or noncompliance. A bad nudge, in contrast will either escape notice, or be sidestepped by those who do notice it. We can expect such a system to be worse at self-correction than a system that combines traditional coercive rules with democratic accountability.  Both moderates like Steve Teles and progressives like Suzanne Mettler have argued that stronger nudging is likely to lead to weaker citizenship. Mettler is worried that it threatens to turn citizens into consumers. For democratic government to be of the people, by the people, for the people, people have to have a clear view of what government is doing, she argues. Nudging, in contrast, may produce efficient policy goals but leaves citizens uninformed and without real agency.  She singles out policy measures such as a stealth Obama tax cut that was intended as a stimulus to boost the economy. This cut was designed to be unobtrusive, so as to nudge people to spend more instead of saving. This may have made it more effective, but it also made it politically invisible to citizens. Teles agrees with these criticisms, and in a minatory passage, foresees “a prostrate citizenry—one insufficiently mobilized to actually challenge deep structural inequalities, let alone to explicitly recognize who has leased its consent.”  Advocates of “nudges” have thought more about economics than about politics  This does not mean that nudging is useless. It does suggest that it should be used only under limited circumstances. One can imagine two circumstances where nudging could work.  One is where there is some default decision that is a) non-obvious to people (or at least difficult for them to stick with even if it is obvious), b) the best plausible decision when you think about it more carefully, and c) does not have any complicated feedback effects. Here, it may be reasonable to guide people toward making the “right” decision, although choice architects still have to be careful.  This description strongly echoes what advocates of nudges say about when their approach should be deployed. But what they do not recognize is that the scope for such nudges is much smaller than it appears at first to be. In a profoundly interconnected society, even apparently simple choices can have complex and unpredictable consequences. As scholars like Scott Page (and Shalizi and I) have argued, technocratic experts are likely to be less able to foresee and account for those consequences than groups that draw on a wider set of diverse perspectives and forms of background knowledge.  In short, for complex issues, democracy (when it can usefully draw upon diversity) is likely to trump technocracy (which draws on more sophisticated, but narrower expertise). Thaler and Sunstein, for example argue that nudges can help us deal with climate change, since global climate is the “outcome of a global choice architecture,” where market pressures and the lack of feedback mean that people often make collectively bad choices. They suggest that experts can design a better choice architecture based on incentive schemes.  But as the different responses of Republicans and Democrats to power saving schemes illustrates, apparently straightforward incentives can backfire, or interact in complex and unforeseeable ways with other factors shaping human behavior. Technocracy may end up being as much part of the problem as the solution  The second is where there are a variety of other “choice architects” — possibly in the private sector — already working hard to shape people’s decisions to selfishly benefit themselves rather than the people making the choices. For example, investment planners who receive commissions for selling specific investment plans have an obvious economic incentive to shape their clients’ choices so as to maximize their own commission income rather than the long-term value of the investments. In such situations, “benign” choice architecture decisions can help keep people from making bad long-term choices.  Here, though, again, there are difficult problems. Purportedly “protective” structures can become magnets for bad actors who will want to influence, infiltrate and reshape them to malign ends. At this very moment, the Trump administration is turning the machinery of the regulatory state to the Republican Party’s ends — for example, by frustrating efforts to guide people toward good health care plans. It is easier for bad actors to undermine or subvert nudges (which are typically semi-formal policies) than to undo binding coercive rules (which need to undergo a complex review process and possible court challenges before they can be changed).  In short, nudge theorists have failed to consider the political consequences of their work. This is understandable, given that their ideas emerged from intramural fights within economics. The argument that Thaler and Sunstein wanted to start — and, in a sense, are still conducting — are with libertarian-leaning economists who do not understand why rational self-interested beings would need others to tell them what they ought to do.  But the truly hard questions don’t come from market fundamentalists. The greatest challenges to nudge theory comes from people who want to know what nudges mean for democracy, for accountability, and for relations between citizens and their governments.

1564,3232,11,10,2017,2017-11-10,Associated Press News,White House: No formal Trump-Putin meeting on Asia trip,"President Donald Trump arrives at Danang International Airport, Friday, Nov. 10, 2017, in Danang, Vietnam. Trump is on a five country trip through Asia traveling to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)  DANANG, Vietnam (AP) — President Donald Trump will not have a formal sit-down with Russian President Vladimir Putin while the two attend a summit, the White House said Friday shortly before Trump landed in Vietnam, the fourth stop on his first official visit to Asia.  Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force Once, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders blamed scheduling conflicts on both sides for the fact that the leaders will not meet formally during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit taking place in the coastal city of Danang.  But Sanders said it was “possible” and “likely” that they could have a less formal encounter, either in Danang or later in the Philippines when Trump and Putin attend another regional conference.  “Now, they’re going to be in the same place. Are they going to bump into each other and say hello? Certainly possible and likely,” she said. “But in terms of a scheduled, formal meeting, there’s not one on the calendar and we don’t anticipate that there will be one.”  U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had told reporters in Beijing on Thursday that there was no reason to schedule a meeting if the U.S. and Russia are unable to make significant progress on issues including Syria and Ukraine.  US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping agree on the need to implement all United Nations Security Council resolutions on North Korea. (Nov. 9)  “The view has been if the two leaders are going to meet, is there something sufficiently substantive to talk about that would warrant a formal meeting,” he said.  Both sides have been working to reach agreement on how they hope to resolve Syria’s civil war once the Islamic State group is defeated. The potential understanding comes as an array of forces are near a final defeat of IS, the extremist group that once controlled vast stretches of both Iraq and Syria. Fighting the group is no longer top priority, shifting the focus back to Syria’s intractable conflict between Russian-backed President Bashar Assad’s government and armed rebels, to whom the U.S. lends at least rhetorical support.  The news comes a day after Trump set aside his blistering rhetoric in favor of friendly overtures to China on Thursday, trying to flatter his hosts into establishing a more balanced trade relationship and doing more to blunt North Korea’s nuclear ambitions.  Winding down his two days in Beijing, Trump suggested that if the U.S. and China jointly took on the world’s problems, “I believe we can solve almost all of them, and probably all of them.”  In the name of furthering that relationship, Trump largely shelved his campaign complaints about China, at least in public. He focused on exhorting Beijing to help with North Korea, an effort expected again to take center stage at an international summit in Vietnam on Friday.  The Chinese rolled out a lavish welcome for the American president. Trump returned the kindness, heaping praise on China’s Xi Jinping and predicting the two powers would work around entrenched differences. On Twitter later, Trump called his meetings with Xi “very productive on both trade and the subject of North Korea.”  On trade, Trump criticized the “very one-sided and unfair” relationship between the U.S. and China. But unlike his approach during the campaign, when he castigated China for what he contended were inappropriate trade practices, Trump said Thursday that he didn’t blame the Chinese for having taken advantage of the U.S.  Trump said China “must immediately address the unfair trade practices” that drive a “shockingly” large trade deficit, along with barriers to market access, forced technology transfers and intellectual property theft.  “But I don’t blame China,” he said. “After all, who can blame a country for being able to take advantage of another country for the benefit of its citizens?”  To applause, Trump said, “I give China great credit.”  Reacting from afar, Sen. Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, said Trump’s comments “make the United States look weak and as if we are bowing to China’s whim. ... Instead of giving China credit for stealing American jobs, the president should be holding China accountable.” Menendez, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is on trial for alleged bribery.  Tillerson offered a blunt assessment of China’s trade surplus with the United States, which in October widened by 12.2 percent from a year earlier to $26.6 billion. The total surplus with the United States for the first 10 months of the year was $223 billion.  “I think the best way to characterize it is that while we appreciate the long hours and the effort that our Chinese counterparts have put into those trade discussions, quite frankly in the grand scheme of a $300- to $500-billion trade deficit, the things that have been achieved are pretty small,” Tillerson told reporters in Beijing.  Tillerson also acknowledged there were differences in “tactics and the timing and how far to go with pressure” on North Korea. But he insisted that the two countries shared common objectives.  “There is no disagreement on North Korea,” he said.  The comments by Trump and his top diplomat came after lengthy meetings with Xi. The day included announcements that the U.S. and China had signed agreements valued at more than $250 billion for products including U.S.-made jet engines, auto parts, liquefied natural gas and beef.  Such contract signings, a fixture of foreign leaders’ visits to Beijing, are intended to defuse complaints about China’s trade policies.  Xi promised a more open business environment for foreign companies in China and said his country was committed to further opening its economy to outside investment.  “China will not close its doors” and will open them “even wider,” he said, pledging that foreign companies in China, including American ones, would find the market “more open, more transparent and more orderly.”  It is unclear how far China will go to fulfill its pledges. Previous U.S. administrations have hailed market-opening promises only to be left disappointed.  Before arriving in China, Trump had delivered a stern message to Beijing, using an address in South Korea to call on China, North Korea’s biggest trade partner, to do more to confront and isolate the North.  Trump appeared far more conciliatory on Thursday, thanking China for its efforts and saying he’d been encouraged by his conversations.  “China can fix this problem easily. And quickly. And I am calling on China and your great president to hopefully work on it very hard,” Trump said. “If he works on it hard it will happen.”  ___  Associated Press writers Christopher Bodeen in Beijing and Darlene Superville and Ken Thomas in Washington contributed to this report.  ___  Follow Colvin on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@colvinj and Lemire at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire",4.0,1,[4.0]
971,2511,10,24,2017,2017-10-24,Fox News,"With Flake retirement, Steve Bannon claims scalp in bid to reshape GOP","The unexpected retirement of U.S. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., will likely further inflame the Republican Party's civil war -- with former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon racking up the fruits of victory in his bid to reshape the party.  Flake announced his resignation Tuesday with a scathing attack on Trump from the Senate floor, calling the commander-in-chief’s behavior “reckless, outrageous, and undignified.""  The senator also slammed the GOP, saying it had “given in or given up on the core principles in favor of a more viscerally satisfying anger and resentment,” and noted that “anger and resentment are not a governing philosophy.""  But Flake's speech was likely music to the ears of Bannon, who has announced plans to run pro-Trump candidates against Senate Republicans who don't back the president's agenda. And Flake's emotional speech was unlikely to change the views of GOP voters who see establishment Republicans such as Flake as obstacles for executing Trump's “America First” agenda.  Recent polls show there is little appetite among voters for anti-Trump legislators in the Senate, especially in Arizona – a state Trump carried in 2016 presidential election. Flake was trailing his primary challenger, Kelli Ward, a former state senator who is backed by Bannon.  After Flake's announcement, Bannon quickly claimed a scalp for his anti-GOP establishment movement, warning incumbents that his recruited candidates “will defeat you in primaries or force you to retire,"" according to Breitbart News Network Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow, who tweeted the reaction.  ""The days of establishment Republicans who oppose the people's America First agenda are numbered,"" Bannon added.  “Many more to come,” Bannon wrote to the Washington Post following Flake’s speech.  Andy Surabian, an adviser for Bannon's pro-Trump political PAC, Great America Alliance, told the Post that the resignation of Flake was a victory for the White House.  “This is a victory for President Trump and all of his supporters across the nation,” he said. “Jeff Flake was America’s top ‘Never Trumper,’ so getting his scalp is a signal to Never Trumpers everywhere that their time is up.”  From Alabama to Mississippi to Nevada, Bannon-backed candidates are emerging to challenge the establishment Republicans during the 2018 midterm elections, potentially reshaping the party beyond recognition.  And while the GOP is coming to realization that opposing Trump is bad politics, some top Republicans have criticized Bannon’s strategy to strengthen pro-Trump elements in Congress by replacing existing GOP senators rather than increasing the majority and taking seats from Democrats.  “Bannon’s so-called ‘war against the GOP establishment,’ is the worst strategic action Republicans could take right now,” wrote Former House speaker Newt Gingrich, noting that the candidates Bannon seeks to replace are senators who voted overwhelmingly for Trump’s agenda despite their public comments.  Noted Gingrich: ""All voted to repeal Obamacare; all supported President Trump’s Cabinet nominations; all supported the American Health Care Act; all supported the so-called Skinny Repeal of Obamacare; and all voted to confirm conservative Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch.”",3.1875,16,"[5.0, 4.0, 4.0, 2.5, 0.5, 5.0, 1.0, 3.5, 3.0, 3.0, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.0, 3.0, 4.0]"
233,1445,9,30,2017,2017-09-30,Associated Press News,Dubai dreams of flying taxis darting among its skyscrapers,"In this Sept. 26, 2017 photo, a Volocopter prototype flies in front of the two hotel towers during a test flight in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Dubai is hoping to one day have flying, pilotless taxis darting among its skyscrapers. Just this week, the city-state in the United Arab Emirates hosted crews from the German company Volocopter, which had an electric, battery-powered two-seat prototype take off and land. Dubai hopes to have rules in place in the next five years to be ready for having the aircraft regularly flying through its skies. (AP Photo/Kamran Jebreili)  DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — With a whirling buzz from 18 rotors, the pilotless helicopter gently lifted off the ground and soared up into the afternoon sky, the spire of the world’s tallest building visible behind it.  The recent unmanned flight by the German-made electric Volocopter represents the latest step in Dubai’s pursuit of flying taxis, which would not seem out of place among the Gulf city’s already futuristic skyline — imagine “Blade Runner,” with less rain.  Dubai already has invested in another model of a flying, autonomous taxi, and is working to design regulations for their use. Putting more passengers in the air could free its already clogged highways and burnish the city’s cutting-edge image of itself.  “It’s public transportation for everybody, so you can use, you can order it, you can pay for the trip and the trip is not much more expensive than with a car,” said Alexander Zosel, Volocopter’s co-founder. “If you build roads, you build bridges, it’s a huge amount and it’s always much more cheaper to have a system where you don’t need that infrastructure.”  Driving in Dubai already makes one yearn for the open skies. Rush hour on Sheikh Zayed Road, a dozen-lane artery running down the length of the city, alternates between dense gridlock and sports-car slalom. Over 1.5 million Dubai-registered vehicles ply its roads, not counting those crowding in from the United Arab Emirates’ six other sheikhdoms.  The Volocopter’s designers envision the electric, battery-powered two-seat helicopters taking off and landing from pads set up across the city. The prototype used in Dubai has a maximum flying time of 30 minutes at 50 kph (31 mph), with a maximum airspeed of 100 kph (62 mph). Batteries charged in climate-controlled areas near the pads would be swapped in as needed.  “I believe (the) urban air taxi will contribute an interesting addition to the existing transportation modes,” Volocopter CEO Florian Reuter said. “There are certain routes that are just extremely beneficial if you can go to the third dimension.”  In practice, however, there’s a long way to go. Convincing white-knuckled flyers to get into a buzzing, pilotless helicopter is just the beginning. Unpiloted passenger flights represent a new frontier for regulators. Dubai’s Road and Transportation Authority, which has invested an undisclosed sum in Volocopter, says it will work the next five years to come up with laws and develop safety procedures.  That’s a longer time frame than initially offered by Dubai. Mattar al-Tayer, the head of the RTA, told a conference in February that the Chinese-made EHang 184, a Volocopter competitor, would be regularly flying through the city’s skies by July, though that deadline came and went. The RTA did not respond to a request for comment.  Still, Dubai remains at the front of the pack when it comes to embracing new technology.  Dubai’s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, says he wants 25 percent of all passenger trips in the city to be done by driverless vehicles by 2030. The city has a deal in place with Los Angeles-based Hyperloop One to study the potential for building a hyperloop line between it and Abu Dhabi, the Emirati capital. That technology has levitating pods powered by electricity and magnetism hurtle through low-friction pipes at a top speed of 1,220 kph (760 mph).  For now, the Volocopter’s brief flights in Dubai drew VIP crowds and film crews making advertisements. But its executives say after rules are in place, they will be ready for mass production. Already, Volocopter has drawn the interest of automobile manufacturer Daimler AG, which was part of a consortium that put up $30 million in capital for Volocopter. Even Airbus, a major airplane manufacturer, is looking at building its own flying taxis.  “We’ve proven that it works,” Zosel said. “At the end of this five years, Dubai will be ready.”  ___  Online:  Volocopter: https://www.volocopter.com/en/  Dubai’s Road and Transportation Authority: https://www.rta.ae  ___  Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellap.

5,85,8,29,2017,2017-08-29,The New York Times,Britain Looks to Address Inequality With Executive Pay Measures," Worried by a long-term rise in inequality, Britain announced on Tuesday a series of measures aimed at increasing transparency over executive compensation, hoping to ramp up pressure on companies that offer lavish salaries for bosses but restrict pay for regular employees.  The proposals include plans to force all publicly listed companies to publish their wage ratio, comparing their chief executive’s salary with that of the average worker, as well as the creation of a register that “names and shames” firms that faced shareholder opposition over executive pay levels.  In much of the Western world, public anger is growing over what critics say are excessive wages for senior business leaders. That has helped contribute to a populist backlash in many countries, as the gap between the salaries of employees and their managers has widened markedly.  In the United States, pay packages for top bosses grew last year, with the highest paid, Thomas M. Rutledge, the chief executive of Charter Communications, making $98 million.

1558,3226,11,9,2017,2017-11-09,Associated Press News,"US and them: America, the elephant in room at climate talks","US and them: America, the elephant in room at climate talks  WASHINGTON (AP) — How’s this for awkward? The United States has a delegation at international climate talks in Bonn that will be telling other nations what they should do on an agreement that the president wants no part of.  President Donald Trump has promised to withdraw the U.S. from the 2015 Paris climate pact where nations set their own goals to reduce the emissions of heat-trapping gases, but because of legal technicalities America can’t get out until November of 2020.  “It’s like having a guest at a dinner party who complains about the food but stays anyway,” said Nigel Purvis, who worked climate issues in the State Department for Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush — and dealt with a similar situation.  In 2001 Purvis was a climate negotiator for the U.S. State Department when the new president, George W. Bush, had pulled out of a landmark global warming agreement the previous administration had championed.  The U.S. position is not just awkward, it’s potentially bad for the environment, scientists say.  Most of the Bonn meeting will be coming up with rules on how countries report emissions of heat-trapping gases and how transparent they are. The United States used to be the leading force in pushing for tougher rules and more openness, Purvis and other experts said. The rules probably won’t be as strong now, Purvis said.  “If it’s left to Chinese leadership, which is what’s left, you will have less transparency,” said Massachusetts Institute of Technology management professor Henry Jacoby, who co-founded the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change.  The United States government is becoming increasingly isolated on climate change. On Tuesday, the Syrian government, mired in war and the last United Nations country not to sign the Paris accord, announced it would sign the pact. That means the United States will be alone when it pulls out.  State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert responded to the Syrian decision by attacking its government. “If the government of Syria cared so much about what was put in the air, then it wouldn’t be gassing its own people,” she said.  In a not-so subtle jab at Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron plans a separate “One Planet Summit” in Paris to push his “Make Our Planet Great Again” agenda on Dec. 12, the anniversary date of the climate accord. He invited more than 100 world leaders to his event, but not Trump. Instead, he invited lower level U.S. diplomats.  “The rest of the world needs to get on and negotiate ... and treat the U.S. as more of an observer in the process and the U.S. should act that way,” said Greenpeace International Director Jennifer Morgan, who has been at these negotiations for more than 20 years.  That’s not what the U.S. plans.  As meetings started on Monday, U.S. negotiator Trigg Talley said, “The president has made clear that we will engage countries on energy and climate change related issues and we look forward to working with colleagues and partners to advance the work here over these two weeks and beyond.”  The administration is hosting a panel on “the clean and efficient use of fossil fuels and nuclear power,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah said Tuesday. “It is undeniable that fossil fuels will be used for the foreseeable future, and it is in everyone’s interest that they be efficient and clean.”  Of the major fossil fuels, coal is by far the biggest climate change culprit. In 2014, coal accounted for 46 percent of the globe’s carbon dioxide emissions, but was only 29 percent of its energy supply, according to the International Energy Agency.  Three U.S. governors, some mayors, corporate leaders and students will also be attending the Bonn talks.  “We have one major major player who is on the sidelines,” California Gov. Jerry Brown told The Associated Press. “The rest of us will do everything we can to keep advancing efforts and keep doing what is needed to reduce carbon emissions. There is no time to wait.”  Former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg announced Thursday he will spend $50 million to help non-United States countries move away from coal. Bloomberg, Brown and others on Saturday will unveil a report called “America’s Pledge” on how much the United States can do without the federal government.  At a “We’re Still In” event Thursday at the climate talks, James Brainard, mayor Carmel, Indiana, joined in criticizing the Trump climate policy, saying the U.S. will cut emissions regardless of the president.  “He talks about greatness a lot,” Brainard said. “Great countries keep their word when they sign agreements. Great countries care about the condition of the planet they are going to hand off to their children and grandchildren.”  If the U.S. remains out of the Paris accord and tries to dismantle President Obama’s initiatives to curb emissions, the Earth will warm by an additional one or two tenths of a degree, said Glen Peters, a Norwegian scientist who is part of the Global Carbon Project.  Scientists say that even a few tenths of a degree of warming can have dramatic impacts on ecosystems and even day-to-day life for people.  Purivs said “countries will be frustrated and resentful” toward the Trump administration at the negotiations. But he added: “Many nations will understand the rules of the Paris agreement are going to be more important and more durable than any U.S. administration and there will be a strong desire to get it right.”  ___  Frank Jordans in Berlin, Maria Murru in Rome and Matt Lee and Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this story.  ___  Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears .

According to census data Mr. Osterman analyzed, more than one-quarter of home health aides in 2015 were immigrants. The proportion in certain states is far higher, reaching nearly one-half in California and nearly two-thirds in New York.  The undoing of DACA may also herald the undoing of other programs that provide a steady source of immigrant labor in the health care sector. For example, the government can grant people from certain countries that have endured hardship, like natural disasters or civil wars, what it calls temporary protected status.  The overwhelming majority of workers granted that status hail from El Salvador, Honduras and Haiti, and many have flocked to low-paying health care professions as well.  “We know from surveys that T.P.S. recipients are highly represented in the work force in certain areas,” said Tom Jawetz, a vice president of the Center for American Progress, a think tank that favors more liberal immigration policies. “In particular, many — especially Haitians — work in home health care.”  The Trump administration has suggested it may not extend the program for Haitians when its most recent extension expires in January, raising questions about whether it will end the program for Hondurans and Salvadorans as well.  As a basic matter of economics, removing tens of thousands of workers from occupations that already suffer from a serious labor shortage — the Labor Department predicts that the country will need more than 1.25 million home health aides by 2024, up from about 900,000 in 2014 — generally has one unambiguous effect: driving up costs.",1.5,1,[1.5]

The coalition wrote in their letter to the Attorney General:  While the undersigned groups’ opinions diverge significantly on many policy issues, we are united in our desire to ensure that free expression is not threatened by an increasingly limited number of companies that dominate U.S. media. We hope that the department seeks aggressively to defend these principles as it reviews the pending merger. As entities that closely follow the U.S media landscape, we are acutely aware that AT&T and Time Warner are already massive media conglomerates in their own rights. AT&T’s 2015 purchase of DirecTV made it the country’s top pay-TV firm, the No. 2 wireless provider, and the No. 3 broadband company. Time Warner, meanwhile, owns CNN and HBO, three of the top five general entertainment cable networks, and the second largest movie studio in Warner Brothers. We are deeply concerned that allowing these firms to join forces — without significant conditions that fully address all competitive concerns — would intolerably limit consumers’ control over what they watch and where they get their information. The First Amendment is the bulwark of political discourse, and the proposed ATT-Time Warner merger will necessarily further restrict the diversity of speech which strengthens our nation as it becomes in the new company’s interest to promote select channels over alternative outlets.  In an op-ed to the Investor’s Business Daily, Americans for Limited Government President Rick Manning wrote that allowing the merger between AT&T and Time Warner could allow for CNN to spread more dishonest news and even have more influence in the media after the merger.  Manning wrote, “For example, this merger could give CNN even more influence and power than they enjoy today. Yes, I’m talking about the “Clinton News Network” that repeatedly presented fake and dishonest news designed to influence the 2016 presidential election outcome.”  Manning added,  If the merger goes through, AT&T’s powerful reach into our homes and computers would give them the ability to increase the power of their own networks — like CNN. CNN and its biased news could gain higher visibility and AT&T could also make it more difficult or impossible for consumers to find conservative or more-balanced news alternatives. The last thing we need is a corporate giant that makes CNN and other networks it owns even more powerful.  On the presidential campaign trail, President Donald Trump labeled the proposed merger between AT&T and Time Warner “as an example of the power structure I’m fighting, AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it’s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.”  Peter Navarro, who now leads the White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, said during the presidential campaign that President Donald Trump would never approve a deal that would concentrate too much power in the hands of the few.  Navarro said:  The very corporations that have gained from shipping America’s factories and jobs offshore are the very same media conglomerates now pushing Hillary Clinton’s agenda. She is the official candidate of the multinational ruling elite. NBC, and its Clinton megaphone MSNBC, were once owned by General Electric, a leader in offshoring factories to China. Now NBC has been bought by Comcast, which is specifically targeting the Chinese market – even as Comcast’s anchors and reporters at MSNBC engage in their Never Trump tactics. AT&T, the original and abusive “Ma Bell” telephone monopoly, is now trying to buy Time Warner and thus the wildly anti-Trump CNN. Donald Trump would never approve such a deal because it concentrates too much power in the hands of the too and powerful few.  CNN, which has served as a constant source of controversy over fake news, might have to become a separate news organization or have its president resign to get the merger approved.  Fox Business’s Charlie Gasparino claimed that Time Warner might need to spin off CNN as a separate entity to make the deal work. Vanity Fair reported in July that AT&T “would spin him off in a minute” to get the merger approved. One media consultant added, “They don’t care about him.”  The Senate confirmed Makan Delrahim to head the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) Antitrust Division, which will review the pending merger between AT&T and Time Warner. Delrahim will have jurisdiction to conduct the antitrust investigation of the merger between AT&T and Time Warner.  The liberal and conservative coalition concluded in their letter:  Ensuring that our society retains effective access to a diversity of viewpoints is a major component of the government’s responsibility to protect competition in media markets, where it also protects the values underlying the First Amendment. At this time where giant media companies are aggressively seeking to consolidate, our antitrust laws have rarely been a more potent and needed defender of American consumers of all stripes and ideologies.

On Thursday, October 19, Obama will appear with Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, who is battling Republican Ed Gillespie in a race for the Virginia governor’s mansion, at a rally in Richmond. The news was first reported by Politico.  Democrats only have a handful of competitive races this Election Day into which they can pour their anti-Trump energies, but the Virginia gubernatorial election is arguably the most important one in which Obama can make a difference.  There’s also a race for governor of New Jersey this November that Democrats are expected to win (a special election for an open Senate seat in Alabama won’t be held until December). Obama will also campaign for Democrat Phil Murphy in New Jersey ahead of that election, according to a source close to the former president, though the date and location of that event have not been determined.  Some recent polls between Gillespie and Northam show Northam with a lead of between 4 and 13 points. The RealClearPolitics polling average puts Northam about 7 points ahead of the former Republican National Committee chair.  ""You should be very skeptical of anyone claiming Northam is going to run away with this,"" says Geoffrey Skelley, a political analyst at the University of Virginia.

1156,2737,10,27,2017,2017-10-27,Breitbart,UC Berkeley Paper Apologizes For Anti-Semitic Cartoon,"TEL AVIV – After first defending its moves, the editors of the University of California’s student newspaper issued an apology and retraction for publishing a Nazi-themed cartoon last week.  The first draft of the Daily Californian‘s editor’s note did not contain an apology as such, instead focusing on justifying cartoonist Joel Mayorga’s handiwork.  The artist’s intent was to argue that the contents of civil liberties lawyer and professor emeritus at Harvard Law School Alan Dershowitz’s recent lecture at UC Berkeley were hypocritical. We regret that the artistic rendering distracted from the discussion the artist was trying to start.  The editor’s note was then updated to “better reflect the sentiment of the editor,” the Daily Californian said. A third version was then published that also included a retraction.  The cartoon hearkened to clearly anti-Semitic tropes. It should not have been published, and we sincerely apologize that it was. The cartoon depicted Alan Dershowitz presenting as he crouched on a stage, with his body behind a cardboard cutout labeled “The Liberal Case for Israel.” Dershowitz was drawn with twisted limbs. His foot was crushing a Palestinian person; placed in his hand was a depiction of an IDF soldier next to someone the soldier had shot. We apologize to our readers and members of our staff who were hurt by the cartoon. We especially apologize to Alan Dershowitz for the ways it negatively impacted him both personally and professionally  The cartoon featured Dershowitz, who was due to give a speech at the university titled “The Liberal Case for Israel,” hiding behind a wall of “liberalism” with a globe-shaped body ostensibly representing perceived Jewish control of the world. In his hand is an IDF soldier who has just shot a Palestinian and underneath his foot a flattened body lies next to a Palestinian flag.  In a letter to the editor, UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol Christ wrote that the cartoon was “offensive, appalling and deeply disappointing” and added that “its anti-Semitic imagery connects directly to the centuries-old ‘blood libel’ that falsely accused Jews of engaging in ritual murder.”  In an essay for the paper, Dershowitz defended his October 11 speech at the university, saying that in it he “advocated the establishment of a Palestinian state and a negotiated end of the conflict. I encouraged hostile questions from protesters and answered all of them.”  This sequence of events by hard-left students who originally protested my right to speak at UC Berkeley confirmed what I’ve long believed: that there is very little difference between the Nazis of the hard right and the anti-Semites of the hard left. There is little doubt that this abhorrent cartoon was a hard-left Neo-Nazi expression. These anti-Semitic displays against me were in reaction to a speech in which I advocated a Palestinian state and an end to the occupation and opposition to Israeli settlement policies. Many on the hard-left refuse to acknowledge this sort of nuanced positioning. That is because their hostility towards Israel does not stem from any particular Israeli actions or policies. Even if Israel were to withdraw from the West Bank, destroy the security barrier and recognize Hamas as a legitimate political organization, it would still not be enough. For these radicals, it is not about what Israel does, it is about what Israel is: the nation-state of the Jewish people. To many on the hard left, Israel is an imperialistic, apartheid, genocidal and colonialist enterprise that must be destroyed.  Dershowitz also told the Daily Wire in response to the cartoon, “I’m surprised that it was treated with as little response. Imagine if a comparably anti-black or anti-woman or anti-gay cartoon was ever published in the Berkeley student newspaper. Again, it reflects for me the incredible double standard in tolerance that people have toward anti-Semitism.”",3.2,5,"[1.5, 3.5, 2.5, 4.0, 4.5]"

Trump administration officials said that the leaders’ exchanges had had a harder edge behind the scenes. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson told reporters that Mr. Trump had, in effect, used flattery to appeal to Mr. Xi to do more to isolate North Korea.  “Our president has been very clear with President Xi that he takes the view that, ‘You are a very powerful neighbor of theirs, you account for 90-plus percent of their economic activity, you’re a strong man,’” Mr. Tillerson said, channeling Mr. Trump. “‘You can, I’m sure, solve this for me.’”  Mr. Tillerson dismissed Mr. Trump’s contention that trade deficits were America’s fault as “a little bit of tongue in cheek” in the midst of a much tougher discussion. During their meeting, he said, Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, ticked off the long history of trade imbalances, and warned they could not be allowed to continue.  The one tangible gain from Mr. Trump’s trip — $250 billion worth of business agreements between American and Chinese companies — was viewed as a token of Chinese good will. Many of the deals are preliminary and will take years to come to fruition. They broke no new ground in areas, like technology, where the United States is losing market access.

The American Hospital Association started warning its members.,"The American Hospital Association is warning its members about Vox’s emergency room billing project.  The memo, reported by trade publication Becker’s Hospital Review, came a week after we launched a new effort to bring more transparency to medical pricing by collecting readers’ emergency room bills.  Bob Herman, a reporter with Axois, later shared the entire memo on Twitter:  Earlier this week, Sarah Kliff, a health reporter with Vox Media, a digital media company, announced the launch of a new year-long reporting project on health care prices. Her first area of focus is hospital bills for emergency services and, specifically, hospitals’ use of facility fees. Ms. Kliff is soliciting patient bills from emergency department visits in the U.S. over the past five years (2012 to 2017). An announcement on this project is found HERE. We expect to see stories throughout the year and in 2018. We encourage you and your entire team to be certain that you remain familiar with your organization’s policies and procedures on patient billing, financial assistance policies, and how to talk about them with patients, their families, and the public.  The AHA recommends that members “share and discuss the issues addressed in this advisory with your media staff” and “be prepared to share what steps your organization currently takes to provide transparent billing information.”  The American Hospital Association represents thousands of hospitals across the country. It estimates a membership of “nearly 5,000 hospitals, health care systems, networks, other providers of care and 43,000 individual members.”  Hospitals typically keep their prices private. One study found it was significantly easier to get information from hospitals about how much their parking costs then track down the price of a common medical procedure. When I have tried to conduct interviews with hospital executives about how they set their prices, I find that many are reluctant to comment.  That’s why we launched our project to collect emergency medical bills — to bring more transparency to prices that are typically opaque (and often set very high).  So far, we’ve collected bills from 346 readers who live in 43 states and the District of Columbia. (If you’re curious, the states we haven’t yet received bills from are Arkansas, Delaware, Hawaii, Mississippi, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming.)  We’re looking forward to reporting back on this data and will be writing stories about it, as the AHA memo expects, throughout 2018.  Do you have an emergency bill you’d like to submit?

219,1336,9,26,2017,2017-09-26,The New York Times,Will a Corporate Tax Holiday Give Workers Anything to Cheer?,"Many forces have shaped this deal, including technology, which replaced workers performing routine tasks, and globalization, which squeezed the margins of many businesses and exposed their workers to competition from cheap labor markets. And yet it would be a mistake to ignore the impact of a corporate ethos that has come to focus on rewarding shareholders and executives at the expense of any other consideration — be it workers’ welfare or even the company’s long-term sustainability. Indeed, workers today amount to little more than a line on the cost side of businesses’ balance sheets, with little claim to its prosperity.  Corporate profits have risen over the last quarter-century, as a share of the nation’s income, even as the workers’ share has shrunk. While executive pay has soared — padded with stock options and shares — the earnings of ordinary workers are below where they were in the 1970s. What’s more, the pensions that ensured workers a retirement perch in the middle class have been replaced by 401(k) savings accounts — which are cheaper for companies but put workers’ retirement prospects at the mercy of the stock market.  “How you divide the pie is a choice,” said Rick Wartzman, who heads the KH Moon Center for a Functioning Society at the Drucker Institute of Claremont Graduate University. “It is being carved differently.”  The change has happened across the board. In his book “The End of Loyalty,” published in May by Public Affairs, Mr. Wartzman lays out a shift in corporate culture both in success stories like Coca-Cola and General Electric and in less successful ones, like Eastman Kodak and General Motors. “For workers, the story was the same, whether they were working at a winner or a losing firm,” he said.  The good news is that it is not impossible to modify the behavior of the corporate leaders who have so drastically altered the contract with their work force over the last few decades. While it may be tempting to cast the new breed of executives as selfish villains who somehow lost their sense of right and wrong, the shift in their behavior responded to a shift in the incentives they faced. It was fed by a belief that snaked its way three or four decades ago from the halls of the University of Chicago through investment-bank trading floors and into the corner offices of corporate America: that the interests of corporate managers must be brought into tight alignment with those of shareholders. It was accompanied by one of the most destabilizing propositions in the modern history of corporate governance: This alignment was best achieved by paying corporate managers almost exclusively with stock.  Mihir A. Desai of Harvard Business School argues that this strategy amounted to outsourcing corporate compensation decisions to the capital markets — which have no way of telling whether the rise or fall in shares is caused by executives’ strategies or simply luck. This produced an enormous bubble in chief executive pay — which rose in tandem with the stock. It also made chief executives’ jobs more uncertain, vulnerable to market downturns. And it vastly distorted their behavior, putting every decision at the service of the share price at the close of the quarter.  Professor Desai points out that in the end, this structure does not really serve shareholders, at least not those with an interest in a company’s prosperity more than a few quarters down the road. “Capitalism seems to be serving managers and investment managers at the expense of shareholders,” he wrote.  Changing this behavior is not beyond the reach of policy. Just as changes in the tax treatment of executive pay in the 1990s encouraged stock-based remuneration, tax reforms might motivate corporate executives to invest for the long term rather than for an immediate stock bump — maybe even encourage stable employment and worker training. Until then, offering tax breaks to American corporations seems more likely to line the pockets of executives and shareholders than to improve their long-term prospects or the prosperity of their workers.",2.25,10,"[2.5, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5, 3.5, 0.5, 2.0, 3.5, 2.5, 0.5]"
19,145,8,30,2017,2017-08-30,Associated Press News,"Harvey knocks out more refineries, shifting global oil flows","ADDS NAME OF REFINERY - This aerial photo shows the Flint Hills Resources oil refinery near downtown Houston on Tuesday, Aug. 29, 2017. (AP Photo/D1avid J. Phillip)  DALLAS (AP) — Hurricane Harvey is sending pump prices higher for U.S. motorists and causing temporary shifts in the flow of oil and gasoline around the world after taking down a huge chunk of U.S. refining capacity.  It will be days or even weeks before the energy sector in the southeast Texas Gulf Coast is back to normal operations as it deals with flooding in the aftermath of Harvey, which has been downgraded to a tropical storm. The region from Corpus Christi, Texas, where Harvey made landfall, to the Louisiana state line accounts for about 3 percent of the U.S. economy and is a crucial export market for oil and chemicals.  Wednesday brought news that the nation’s biggest refinery, which was already running below half-speed, had begun a complete shutdown. The Motiva Enterprises plant in Port Arthur, Texas, run by a unit of the state-owned oil company of Saudi Arabia, was the latest domino to fall among Gulf Coast refineries.  More than one-fifth of U.S. refining capacity has been shuttered, according to S&P Global Platts.  With that, gasoline futures headed higher for a third straight day. They had climbed 10 cents to $1.88 a gallon Wednesday  Retail gas prices climbed, too, up 2 cents a gallon on Wednesday and 7 cents in the past week, to a national average price of $2.42 per gallon, according to Gasbuddy.  “In terms of product price increases, it might get worse before it gets better,” said Rob Smith, an energy analyst with IHS Markit.  It could take two weeks or longer before big refineries in the Houston area can recover from a record-setting deluge and resume normal operations. That assumes they didn’t suffer serious damage, which is still unknown.  Harvey isn’t the first big storm to hit the refinery-rich Gulf Coast, but the oil industry has undergone big changes since the last major interruption from Hurricane Ike in 2008.  The so-called shale revolution has led to a surge in oil production in the U.S., increasing the nation’s exports of crude oil and gasoline to Mexico and other places in Latin America, and diesel to Europe.  When the U.S. can’t produce enough gasoline or diesel to meet export demands, other regions are forced to look for replacement supplies “and the backfill has to come from further away,” said Richard Joswick, an analyst with S&P Global Platts. “It has to come from Asia even.”  The result will be higher prices, but it should be just a one- or two-week problem, Joswick said.  Patrick DeHaan, an analyst for GasBuddy, predicts that U.S. gasoline prices will top out around $2.50 or $2.55 a gallon, an increase of up to 20 cents since Harvey hit, with bigger spikes closer to the Gulf.  The recovery from Harvey will mimic the storm’s path from west to east. Flint Hill Resources’ refinery in Corpus Christi, where Harvey made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane, could begin to restart — a process that takes days — as early as Wednesday. Other refineries in the area are likely to do the same later this week.  “It takes some time to start up a refinery under normal circumstances, and it wouldn’t be surprising if they run into hiccups,” said Smith, the HIS Markit analyst. “It could be a week if not longer before Corpus Christi is at normal operations.”  Exxon, Shell and other companies have reported to Texas regulators that some of their storage tanks and other facilities near Houston were damaged by the torrential rains and flooding. Most of the reports seem to indicate relatively minor damage, but still it could be days before crews can assess matters and make repairs.  Even once the refineries are running, pipelines and ports are needed to carry their gasoline, diesel and other fuels to consumers.  A major pipeline supplying the East Coast with gasoline remains shut down — partly because with refineries closed, there is nothing to ship, but also because of damage in at least three areas. Another pipeline that carries crude from the big Permian Basin field in Texas to Houston-area refineries is also closed.  Other sectors are also slowly emerging from Harvey’s mess.  —INSURANCE: Damage estimates from wind, storm surges and flooding are soaring, with Moody’s Analytics putting them between $51 billion and $75 billion. RMS, a company that advises insurers, estimates the cost at $70 billion to $90 billion. TD Economics said Harvey will cut 0.1 to 0.4 points from U.S. third-quarter economic growth.  — SHIPPING: In a hopeful sign, port officials in Corpus Christi say that an initial check turned up some damage from Harvey’s landfall over the weekend, but they hope to restart shipping on Monday. First, however, the Coast Guard will have to declare the shipping lanes clear, and boat pilots will have to be satisfied it’s safe.  All four ports in the Houston area remain closed and aren’t likely to reopen for several days.  — TRAVEL: Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said Houston’s two airports would resume limited service late Wednesday afternoon.  United Airlines planned to operate three departures and three arrivals Wednesday night at Bush Intercontinental Airport, a spokesman said. Other carriers, such as American Airlines, planned to wait until Thursday. At Hobby Airport, Southwest Airlines, the dominant carrier, doesn’t plan any flights before Saturday, according to a spokeswoman.  More than 1,600 U.S. flights had been canceled by afternoon, most of them at the Houston airports, according to tracking service FlightAware.",3.5,1,[3.5]
1223,2821,10,31,2017,2017-10-31,Associated Press News,"For first time in decade, UK interest rates are due to rise"," A Thursday, Aug. 3, 2017 file photo, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, addresses the media during a press conference to deliver the quarterly inflation report in London. The Bank of England seems set to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade on upcoming Thursday, attempting to tackle rising inflation, according to suggestions signalled by bank governor Mark Carney.(AP Photo/Frank Augstein, FILE)  LONDON (AP) — The Bank of England is on Thursday set to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade in order to keep a lid on inflation, a move that has the potential to hurt the British economy just as it struggles with the uncertainties of Brexit.  The central bank is expected to lift its main interest rate by a quarter percentage point from the record low of 0.25 percent, taking back the cut it made in the aftermath of last year’s Brexit vote to support the economy through the market turmoil of the time.  If it delivers the cut, as bank Governor Mark Carney has indicated, it would be its first hike since July 2007, when world credit markets started to freeze up in what would prove to be an early phase of the global financial crisis.  The main motivation behind an increase is to bring down inflation, which is running above the bank’s target of 2 percent by a full percentage point and making life more expensive for households. Any further rise from the current annual rate of 3 percent would require Carney to write to Treasury chief Philip Hammond explaining why inflation is running more than a percentage point above target and what he and his colleagues on the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee are planning to do about it.  The reason for the spike in inflation is simple: Brexit. The pound plunged following the vote in June last year to leave the European Union, and now trades about 15 percent lower against a range of currencies. That has caused a spike higher in the cost of imported goods, notably food and energy.  Under normal circumstances, that would be more than enough reason to raise the cost of borrowing; higher interest rates can push up a currency, thereby dampening inflation by lowering import costs, and can also help cool an overheating economy.  The dilemma for the Bank of England is that the British economy isn’t showing any signs of overheating. Though unemployment stands at its lowest level since the mid-1970s and the main stock market in October hit a record high, the British economy is growing by less than any of the Group of Seven industrialized nations.  “Higher rates will be an unhelpful influence at a time when the economy is still struggling,” said Samuel Tombs, chief U.K. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.  Though economic growth in the July-September period was slightly better than expected at a quarterly rate of 0.4 percent, the British economy has fared worse than the likes of Germany, Japan and the United States this year. Wages are also not rising as much as prices, meaning household finances are getting stretched, while credit growth has eased back over the summer. And inflation, in any case, is forecast to fall back next year as the lower pound’s influence drops out of the annual comparison.  The worry is that by raising interest rates now, the Bank of England could further hobble an economy that’s trying to steer the choppy waters of Brexit. Higher interest rates should in theory act as a dampener on household spending, even though the proportion of mortgage debt in Britain on flexible interest rates has fallen over the past few years, with more people opting for the security of fixed rates.  According to Oliver Harvey, a strategist at Deutsche Bank, a rate hike will have a direct financial impact on “a relatively smaller amount” of households than before the financial crisis. However, those that will be affected by a rate hike would suffer noticeably due to the fact that rates are so low — even the anticipated quarter point increase would mean a doubling in the interest rate.  Harvey also notes that many households are already burdened by weak income growth, low savings and high debt.  As such, the decision to raise interest rates is not expected to be unanimous, with some rate-setters opting for a cautious approach in light of all the concerns surrounding Brexit.  The country is due to leave the EU in March 2019, and there’s no clarity on what the post-Brexit relationship between Britain and the EU, its main export market, will look like. Businesses are fretting about the lack of certainty and have urged the British government to swiftly conclude a transition agreement with the EU that will see the economic relationship remain in place for at least two years after Brexit. Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein is one prominent business leader to have warned in recent days that his firm may relocate chunks of his business out of London to Germany’s financial center in Frankfurt.  As a result, few economists think the Bank of England will embark on a quick sequence of rate hikes. ING economist James Smith expects Thursday’s vote to be 7-2 in favor of an increase and says that anything less could expose divisions among the rate-setting panel that would rein in expectations of any further hikes next year.  “We expect the bank to continue talking up the possibility of further tightening this week, but with uncertainty elevated, demand sluggish and few signs of domestic inflation, we think the bank will tread carefully,” said Smith.",3.6313559322033897,118,"[4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.0, 4.5, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 5.0, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 2.5, 5.0, 4.0, 4.5, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 1.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 2.5, 5.0, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 2.5, 5.0, 3.5, 3.0, 2.5, 4.5, 1.5, 4.5, 3.0, 4.5, 4.0, 5.0, 1.5, 5.0, 1.5, 3.5, 2.5, 4.0, 5.0, 2.5, 4.0, 4.5, 0.5, 4.0, 0.5, 4.5, 2.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.0, 3.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.5, 2.5, 4.0, 2.5, 4.0, 4.0, 5.0, 4.5, 2.5, 4.0, 3.5, 0.5, 2.5, 5.0, 4.5, 5.0, 2.5, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 3.0, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0, 3.0, 5.0]"

Hollingsworth/The Virginian-Pilot via AP)  Sweeping Democratic victories in Virginia and key gains in other 2017 state legislative races have lifted Democratic hopes of even bigger wins in next year’s midterm elections, as they seek a greater voice in how political districts will be redrawn for the decade to come.  Democrats won the governors’ offices in Virginia and New Jersey on Tuesday, erased a previously dominant Republican majority in the Virginia House of Delegates and won a special election that gave them control of the Washington state Senate.  All told, Democrats flipped about two dozen state legislative seats around the country Tuesday and have now gained at least 30 seats previously held by Republicans since President Donald Trump won election last year, reversing several years of Republican momentum.  “In general, this is a rebuke of Republican governance of states,” said Jessica Post, executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. She added: “The other thing it said is we can win all across the country.”  The fight for control of legislative chambers matters not only for policies on health care, taxes and education, but also because the legislature in most states determines how future congressional and state legislative districts are drawn. The next round of redistricting will take place after the 2020 Census, and both parties are focused on controlling as many states as possible by then.  Republicans swept to power in many states in the 2010 elections, just in time to use their new authority during the last round of redistricting. Since then, Republicans have gained more than 900 state legislative seats nationwide.  This year’s Democratic victories are “a very small step forward” by comparison and have largely come in “seats, that by all rights, they probably should have had already,” said Matt Walter, president of the Republican State Leadership Committee.  Heading into Tuesday’s elections, Republicans controlled more than two-thirds of all state legislative chambers, including full control of both chambers and the governor’s office in about two dozen states. By comparison, Democrats had complete control in only a half-dozen states. Just five states had legislatures where each party controlled one chamber, and several of those involved bipartisan coalitions.  During the past year, Democrats have launched a coordinated effort to chip away at Republican dominance from lower-level offices on up. It’s been aided by the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, which is chaired by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder.  Democratic Party leaders pointed to Tuesday’s results as the fruits of their revamped strategy.  Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez told reporters on a conference call that 33 groups worked in Virginia to help elect Democrats, doubling the number of voter contacts from four years ago. Various Democratic entities poured millions of dollars into races there and elsewhere.  Democrat Ralph Northam won the Virginia governor’s race, and Democrats whittled the Republicans’ 66-34 House majority down to a near even split with several races still too close to call. Most of the Democrats’ gains came in districts that had voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton over Trump in last year’s elections.  The Democratic legislative candidates were aided by a large voter turnout in the governor’s race. Anti-Trump sentiment motivated lot of voters who previously didn’t take an interest in governor’s races, Republican consultant Chris Jankowski, an architect of the GOP’s 2010 REDMAP redistricting project, told attendees Wednesday at a Harvard University redistricting conference.  Democrats would have won even more Virginia House seats had the districts not been gerrymandered so heavily in favor of Republicans, said Kelly Ward, executive director of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee.  “It shouldn’t take tsunami-level elections in order to maybe tie — maybe — in the House of Delegates,” Ward said at the Harvard conference.  Nonetheless, Democrats say the large swing in Virginia shows it’s possible for them to flip other chambers next year, including the Colorado Senate, Michigan House and both chambers of the Minnesota Legislature.  Democrat Phil Murphy’s victory in Tuesday’s race for New Jersey governor, replacing termed-out Republican Gov. Chris Christie, means Democrats will hold the trifecta of the chief executive office and both legislative chambers, where they picked up even more seats Tuesday.  Democrats also regained control of both houses of the Washington state Legislature, when Manka Dhingra won a special election that flipped the balance of power in the state Senate. More than $8.7 million was spent on the race, including about $5.9 million by third-party groups. That made it the most expensive legislative contest in the state’s history.  In special elections in Georgia, Democrats claimed three seats previously held by Republicans — all three in suburban areas.  GOP strategist Chip Lake, a Georgia-based political consultant, said Republicans “are hemorrhaging college-educated voters in the suburbs” but added that Democrats also face hurdles revealed by their 2016 losses and should be careful about celebrating too much.  For Republicans to bounce back nationally, it will be crucial for the GOP-led Congress to pass a tax overhaul and address problems surrounding health care, he said.  “Absent that, what we saw yesterday could be a precursor of what happens in 2018,” Lake said.  ___  Follow David A.

We don’t merely need training programs for niche populations or circumstances, expensive and short executive-education programs or brief excursions like TED talks. Instead we need the kind of in-depth education and training people receive routinely at age 13.  In addition, we must recognize that economic upheaval at the macro level means turmoil and instability at the personal level. A lifetime of work will be a lifetime of change, moving between firms, jobs, careers and cities.  Each move has financial and personal costs: It might involve going without a paycheck, looking for new housing, finding a new school district or adjusting to a new vocation. We cannot expect to create a vibrant and flexible overall economy unless we make these shifts as painless as possible. We need a fresh round of policy innovation focused on creating a safety net that gives workers the peace of mind — and the money — to move deftly when circumstances change.  Finally, we can learn from the economist Joseph Schumpeter’s prescient analysis of entrepreneurs. He noted that for new innovations to spread and improve our lives, there will always be creative destruction. For new firms and sectors to arise, some of the old ones must die.  Even if we should be humble in predicting that self-driving vehicles will upend the trucking sector or drone delivery will decimate supermarkets, we can be confident that some creative destruction is coming.  Our current policies — and impulses — are to resist such destruction. If a large manufacturer is set to close, subsidies and other policies kick into action to prevent that shutdown. But while we may save a factory, ultimately we hinder the rise of new technologies; rather than propping up incumbent firms we ought to enable innovation to take its course.  If that idea makes you uneasy, it is probably because our current policies do nothing to protect the most vulnerable from the costs of all this destruction. We resist letting factories close because we worry about what will become of the people who work there. But if we had a social insurance system that allowed workers to move fluidly between jobs, we could comfortably allow firms to follow their natural life and death cycle.",3.0,1,[3.0]
1417,3037,11,5,2017,2017-11-05,Associated Press News,Brazile stirs Dem party strife as bellwether gov race nears," In this Monday, March 6, 2017, file photo, Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chairman Tom Perez speaks at a protest in Washington. The Democratic National Committee chairman, Perez, is questioning Donna Brazile's claim, his predecessor, that she could have initiated efforts to replace Hillary Clinton as the party's presidential nominee with then-Vice President Joe Biden. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats are struggling to put the bitter 2016 election behind them as the party’s current chairman and his predecessor bicker over Hillary Clinton’s failed campaign, further exposing deep divisions two days before the closely watched Virginia governor’s race that could foretell Democratic prospects in 2018 and beyond.  The dueling across Sunday news shows was triggered by the disclosure that Donna Brazile, the interim Democratic leader during the final months of the campaign, considered an effort to replace Clinton as the presidential nominee because of health concerns.  “The charge that Hillary Clinton was somehow incapacitated is quite frankly ludicrous,” said Tom Perez, who took over as Democratic National Committee chairman after Donald Trump won the election.  Brazile, who claimed “tremendous pressure” to devise a backup ticket led by then-Vice President Joe Biden after Clinton fainted at an event, pushed back: “Go to hell. I’m going to tell my story.”  The dispute was spurred by revelations by Brazile in a memoir being released Tuesday and reported on by The Washington Post. It reflected simmering tensions between establishment and insurgent wings that will set the party’s future course on issues from its platform to the primary schedule and use of superdelegates — party leaders and elected officials who get a say in the nomination — in the 2020 presidential race.  “One of the things, as we go forward, is to give more power to the grass roots in all this,” said House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California, urging Democrats not to “relitigate elections.”  Brazile writes that she considered initiating Clinton’s removal after the candidate collapsed while leaving a 9/11 memorial service in New York City, and Brazile contemplated a dozen combinations to replace Clinton and her running mate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine. Brazile wrote that she settled on Biden and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker as having the best chance of defeating Republican Trump.  Brazile says the larger issue was that Clinton campaign was “anemic” and had taken on “the odor of failure.”  But, she says, “I thought of Hillary, and all the women in the country who were so proud of and excited about her. I could not do this to them.”  The revelations elicited a strong weekend rebuttal from Clinton’s former campaign staffers. An open letter signed by more than 100 people said they “do not recognize the campaign” that Brazile “portrays in the book.”  The Clinton staffers responded they were “shocked to learn” that Brazile would consider overturning the will of Democratic voters. “It is particularly troubling and puzzling that she would seemingly buy into false Russian-fueled propaganda, spread by both the Russians and our opponent, about our candidate’s health.”  On Sunday, Perez echoed the complaints, saying Brazile never had authority under DNC rules to replace the ticket because Clinton was not incapacitated.  Under party rules, a DNC head can call a special meeting to fill a “vacancy” on the national ticket in the event of disability in coordination with Democratic leaders of Congress and Democratic governors, but only the full DNC can fill the vacancy. At the time, Clinton had revealed she was suffering from pneumonia.  “I don’t know what Donna Brazile fell for,” Perez said. “Hillary Clinton was anything but incapacitated. She was tireless.”  “I think people who read that charge, which is just without merit, are going to perhaps start wondering about other claims in the book,” he added.  The book’s revelations come just before Tuesday’s Virginia’s governor race, where Republicans have not won a significant statewide election since 2009. The Democratic candidate, Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, is casting the race to voters as a way to repudiate the policies of Trump against Ed Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman. But Northam has received lukewarm support within his own party from the progressive group Democracy for America.  A win for Democrats could help defuse Brazile’s book and give the party important momentum. A loss would be a big blow to other Democrats plotting a similar anti-Trump strategy in the 2018 midterm congressional races and likely spur louder calls for radical changes in the DNC heading into 2020. Also Tuesday is a New Jersey governor’s race, where Democrat Phil Murphy holds a solid lead over Republican Lt. Gov Kim Guadagno to succeed departing Gov. Chris Christie, also a Republican.  In an excerpt published earlier by Politico, Brazile had written that she believed a joint fundraising agreement signed between Clinton and the DNC “looked unethical” and that she felt Clinton had too much influence on the party during a competitive Democratic primary with rival Bernie Sanders.  Over the weekend, Perez issued a statement saying he and the DNC leadership were committed to ensuring that the nomination process in 2020 will be “unquestionably fair and transparent.”  Among the reforms he said he developed after listening to Democrats across the party spectrum was ensuring that “no candidate participating in our presidential nominating process gains any unfair advantage — real or perceived — during our primary season.” He also said the debate schedule would be decided in advance rather than negotiated after all candidates had entered the race.  Perez pledged to ensure that all joint fundraising agreements would be transparent, including the new Democratic Grassroots Victory Fund agreements developed with the 50 state parties.  Still in play are recommendations of a Unity Reform Commission, created in a concession to supporters of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders to re-examine the nominating process, including the role of superdelegates and primary scheduling.  “We have to make sure that everybody feels at the end of the process that everyone got a fair shake,” Perez said.  Perez spoke on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Brazile appeared on ABC’s “This Week,” and Pelosi was on CNN’s “State of the Union.”  ___  Associated Press writer Stephen Ohlemacher contributed to this report.",3.75,10,"[2.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 2.5]"

Congress is looking for ways to raise revenue, and one of the methods reportedly under consideration is to limit how much pre-tax money workers can contribute to their 401(k) and similar accounts. If it were to happen, the move would strike at a way that tens of millions of Americans use to save for retirement. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File)  NEW YORK (AP) — The 401(k) may be in Washington’s crosshairs.  Congress is looking for ways to raise revenue as part of a tax overhaul plan, and one of the methods reportedly under consideration is to curtail how much pretax money workers can contribute to their 401(k) and similar accounts. Such a move would strike at a way that tens of millions of Americans use to save for retirement.  The suggestion has already run into some resistance, even if it isn’t an official policy proposal. President Donald Trump said Monday in a tweet that “There will be NO change to your 401(k). This has always been a great and popular middle class tax break that works, and it stays!”  Here’s a look at how prevalent the 401(k) has become and how it’s used:  HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ACTIVELY PARTICIPATING IN A 401(K)?  About 55 million Americans, who altogether have more than $5 trillion invested in the plans, according to the Investment Company Institute, a trade group representing mutual funds.  Roughly $19 of every $100 in U.S. retirement assets is in a 401(k) account. A decade ago, $17 of every $100 was in a 401(k). The rest is in pension funds, Individual Retirement Accounts, annuities and other investments.  ___  WHY ARE 401(k)s SO IMPORTANT?  U.S. households are increasingly in charge of saving for their own retirements.  Traditional pensions, which pay out a set amount to retirees, are growing closer to extinction. Plus, the retirement of the baby boomers is straining the Social Security trust fund, which is expected to run dry in 2034.  Enter the 401(k) account, which Congress created in 1978. It allows workers to set aside some of their pay and avoid paying even a cent of taxes on it until making withdrawals in retirement. By that time, savers may be making less in income than in their working years, which would mean they pay lower income-tax rates.  One of the big benefits of a 401(k) is that it can make saving automatic. Deductions get taken out of each paycheck. A growing number of employers are also automatically enrolling their workers into a 401(k) program and even automatically increasing their contribution rate each year, in hopes of setting workers up for better retirements.  ___  HOW ARE 401(K) ACCOUNTS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER RETIREMENT PLANS?  They allow workers to save more each year for retirement, on a tax-deferred basis. This year, for example, workers can set aside up to $18,000 in contributions. Workers aged 50 and over can contribute up to $24,000.  By comparison, the annual limit for tax-deferred contributions in an IRA is $5,500, or $6,500 for people aged 50 and above.  ___  HOW BIG IS THE TYPICAL 401(K)?  The average balance for a 401(K) was $97,700 at the end of June, according to Fidelity, which looked at 15 million participants in 22,200 plans. That’s a record, and the totals have been rising as the stock market continues to climb and workers set aside more of their pay.  Workers contributed an average of $5,850 to their 401(k) in the 12 months through June, up 4 percent from a year earlier. Proposals have reportedly discussed capping the annual pretax amount as low as $2,400.  The average IRA balance is slightly larger, at $100,200, according to Fidelity.  ___  ARE THERE ANY DOWNSIDES TO A 401(K)?  The menu of available investments isn’t always the best. Workers have filed numerous lawsuits in recent years against their employers, alleging that the 401(k) plan offers only funds that charge too-high fees or that have poor track records.  Even if good options are available, many workers feel uncomfortable making investment choices. That’s one reason employers have been steering many workers into target-date retirement funds. These all-in-one mutual funds shift from risky investments toward safer ones as the targeted year of retirement approaches.  ___  ARE 401(K) PLANS JUST FOR THE RICH?  No, but the rich can get the most benefit. Higher-income workers are able to set aside more of their pay in a 401(k) account than lower-income workers for the simple reason that they have more to save.  But an additional benefit is that the dollars that higher-income workers are deducting from their taxable income would have been taxed at a higher rate than contributions made by lower-income workers. In other words, the tax benefit of a $1,000 contribution is worth more for a higher-income worker than one made by a worker who is several tax-bracket rungs below.  ___  WHY WOULD CONGRESS CONSIDER THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE?  Washington is hoping to cut income-tax rates across the board, but the only way to do that without sending the national debt skyrocketing even higher is to raise revenue elsewhere.  By curtailing the amount of 401(k) contributions that are tax deferred, Congress would be able to reap some of those dollars now rather than waiting to tax them when they’re withdrawn decades in the future.",3.610091743119266,109,"[4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.5, 0.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.0, 1.5, 3.5, 2.5, 5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 1.5, 3.5, 3.0, 1.5, 5.0, 3.5, 0.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.0, 5.0, 1.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 2.5, 3.0, 5.0, 3.0, 5.0, 4.5, 3.0, 3.0, 3.5, 4.5, 2.0, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5, 3.0, 4.5, 4.0, 5.0, 0.5, 1.5, 4.5, 1.5, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 2.5, 5.0, 2.5, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 0.5, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 1.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 2.0, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 3.0, 4.5, 5.0, 0.5, 5.0, 2.5, 3.5, 3.0, 2.5, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.5, 4.5, 2.5, 5.0, 1.5, 4.0, 3.0, 4.5, 4.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.0]"

A new NASA satellite finds another thing to blame on El Nino: A recent record high increase of carbon dioxide in the air. The satellite details how the super-sized El Nino a couple years ago added 2.5 billion tons of carbon into the air, making the natural phenomenon the main factor in the biggest jump in heat-trapping gas levels in modern record, NASA scientists said. (AP Photo/Rony Muharrman, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — A new NASA satellite has found another thing to blame on El Nino: A recent record high increase of carbon dioxide in the air.  The super-sized El Nino a couple of years ago led to an increase of 3 billion tons of carbon in the air, most from tropical land areas. The El Nino made it more difficult for plants to suck up man-made carbon emissions and sparked fires that released more carbon into the atmosphere.  The effect was so large that it was the main factor in the biggest one-year jump in heat-trapping gas levels in modern record, NASA scientists said.  Scientists have long known that carbon dioxide levels spike during an El Nino, the natural occasional warming of parts of the central Pacific that causes droughts in some places, floods in others and generally adds to warmer temperatures worldwide.  Data from NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2, which was launched in 2014, provides more specifics on how that happens and by continent.  Researchers found that in drought-struck parts of South America plants grew less, there were more fires in Asia, and there was an increased rate of leaf decay in Africa. The findings were published Thursday in the journal Science.  That 3 billion tons of carbon, while significant, is still dwarfed by the 10 billion tons a year that comes from the burning of coal, oil and gas, said Scott Denning, a Colorado State University atmospheric scientist.  Study co-author Annmarie Eldering, NASA’s deputy project scientist for the satellite, said the new results show how El Nino can counteract efforts to reduce carbon emissions.  Human-caused carbon dioxide emissions were roughly flat in 2014, 2015 and 2016, but National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration figures show that 2015 saw a rise in carbon in the air 3.03 parts per million, the largest since scientists started tracking emissions in Hawaii in 1959.  Normally about 25 percent of the human-caused carbon emissions are sucked up by plants on land, but during this powerful El Nino that was only 5 percent, said Junjie Liu, a NASA scientist and study lead author.  Oceans took out more than normal amount of carbon out of the atmosphere, but it wasn’t enough to compensate for the land deficit, Eldering said.  Jonathan Overpeck, a University of Michigan scientist who was not part of the study, said the research revealed that the regional links between carbon dioxide and El Nino are more complex than previously thought, and raised concern about how the earth will respond to more future warming.  As the world warms, the tropics could add to carbon to the atmosphere in the future instead of taking it out of the air and wildfire emissions are likely to get more severe, Overpeck said.  And some computer simulations say the frequency of El Nino will increase in the future with climate change, Denning said during a NASA press conference.  “In this sense, the 2015-16 El Nino is a glimpse of what is to come,” Overpeck said in an email.",3.1818181818181817,11,"[2.0, 4.5, 5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 2.5, 1.5, 3.0, 3.5, 0.5, 5.0]"
1055,2633,10,27,2017,2017-10-27,Fox News,Cuba bugged by US allegations of sonic attacks,"Could the mysterious “sonic attacks” allegedly waged against U.S. Embassy employees in Cuba really just be the sounds of very loud crickets and cicadas?  That’s what Cuban officials seemed to suggest Thursday in a half-hour prime-time television special titled “Alleged Sonic Attacks.”  The special broadcast was Cuban officials’ most detailed defense to date against U.S. accusations that American diplomats in Havana were subjected to mysterious sounds that left them with a variety of ailments -- including headaches, hearing problems and concussions.  With the report, Cuban officials sought to undermine the Trump administration's assertion that 24 U.S. officials or their relatives had been subjected to deliberate attacks by a still-undetermined culprit.  Many U.S. officials reported being subjected to loud, grating noises before falling ill. The U.S. has not accused Cuba of carrying out the attacks, but says that Cuba has not met its obligation to protect diplomats on its territory.  In response to the alleged attacks in Havana, the Trump administration earlier this month expelled 15 diplomats from the Cuban Embassy in Washington, Fox News reported.  The U.S. also has cut staffing by 60 percent at its embassy in Havana, issued a travel warning for Americans going to Cuba and stopped issuing visas for Cubans in Havana.  The measures have reversed the warming in U.S.-Cuba relations seen under President Barack Obama and cut into the increasingly important flow of tourists to Cuba, whose economy went into recession last year for the first time in more than two decades.  Lack of evidence?  The television special pointed out what it alleged was a lack of evidence for the U.S. accusations. It argued the United States had failed to show that such attacks had actually occurred because it had not given Cuba or the public access to the testimony or medical records of U.S. officials who reported attacks, despite three visits to Cuba by U.S. investigators in June, August and September.  ""The members of the U.S. delegation said they don't have evidence that confirms that these reported attacks occurred, and brought up that there was no working theory about the cause of the health problems reported by their diplomats,"" the program's narrator said.  The narrator said Cuba had undertaken an exhaustive investigation ordered by ""the highest government authorities,"" a clear reference to President Raul Castro. Cuba did not possess any technology capable of carrying out a sonic attack and importing it was prohibited by law, according to the special.  “This is slander by the United States,” Col. Ramiro Ramírez, responsible for the security of diplomats in Cuba, told Reuters earlier this week.  The creators of the report interviewed neighbors of the affected diplomats who said they had not heard any strange sounds or suffered any symptoms, which the special presented as another purported weakness in the U.S. allegations. It said security around U.S. diplomats' homes had been dramatically increased.  The U.S. State Department declined to comment at length on the Cuban critique, saying Thursday that, ""the safety and wellbeing of American citizens is our top priority ... We are continuing our investigation into the attacks, and the Cuban government has told us they will continue their efforts as well.""  Alternate explanation  Thursday night's special did not present an alternate explanation for the facts presented by U.S. officials, with one significant exception. Officials with Cuba's Interior Ministry said that U.S. investigators had presented them with three recordings made by presumed victims of sonic attacks and that analysis of the sounds showed them to be extremely similar to those of crickets and cicadas that live along the northern coast of Cuba.  ""It's the same bandwidth and it's audibly very similar,"" said Lt. Col. Juan Carlos Molina, a telecommunications specialist with the Interior Ministry. ""We compared the spectrums of the sounds and evidently this common sound is very similar to the sound of a cicada.""  The program's narrator said that unnamed ""North American researchers"" had found that some cicada and cricket noises could be louder than 90-95 decibels, enough to produce hearing loss, irritation and hypertension in situations of prolonged exposure.  Cuba said it had reported its findings on the similarity of the recordings to cricket sounds, and the U.S. had not responded.  The special's narrator said U.S. diplomats continued to travel around Cuba after the incidents began to be reported, and there were requests for dozens of visas for visits by friends and family, something the narrator said undermined U.S. allegations that the diplomats were not being kept safe in Cuba.

But they lost the video stream Monday morning, apparently when power to the building near Houston’s Galleria failed. So it was impossible to assess if any damage was occurring, said Paul Kline, a veterinarian based in and watching from Dallas. To his relief, the video came back Tuesday and “we could see cars going by on the street outside — a good sign,” Kline said. By Wednesday, with the rains gone, he could see the practice had indeed escaped the flooding in the area.  Plenty of small business owners spent a long five days, waiting to see if the rainfall that totaled more than 50 inches in some places would flood their businesses. Harvey’s winds and rains damaged or destroyed many small businesses in the storm’s path along the Gulf Coast.  It was a tornado spawned by Harvey that destroyed the office of Kenneth Bryant’s used-car dealership in Katy, Texas, just west of Houston. The winds Saturday morning picked up the office and slammed it into the building next door.  “I lost everything in there: titles to vehicles, keys, paperwork, computers,” said Bryant, whose business was not insured. Two of the 10 cars in his inventory were destroyed.  There was more bad news on Wednesday: The remaining cars had been flooded. Bryant won’t know how severely they were damaged until he was able to unlock them.  “Where do we go from here? I don’t know. It’s going to be such a long road ahead,” Bryant said.  For many companies, damage to their premises was just the start. Some lost inventory that would cost them future sales. Workers were stranded or dealing with the devastation of their homes. Companies that couldn’t operate were losing revenue and profits every day.  Fiyyaz Pirani estimates that his Houston-based company, Medology, lost $100,000 in new business. It’s been operating with six staffers instead of its usual 60 since the storm began, and accommodating only existing customers.  “We had a couple of employees who sustained a lot of damage to their homes, and some people are in shelters,” he said.  The company, which helps patients get low-cost lab tests and other services, moved back to its regular location Tuesday from temporary quarters, with generator power but no air conditioning. Staffers were working around some puddles of water at their top-floor office.  Eleanor Rem had several inches of water in her Houston home, which also houses her business. Rem, who helps children with dyslexia learn to read, opted not to try what might have been a difficult evacuation with an 88-year-old relative.  The rains that flooded her street, backyard and driveway on Monday began creeping into her home. She and her husband got their first-floor furniture upstairs, but the carpet was soaked. Rem said she was constantly checking to see how bad the damage was.  “We’re pretty exhausted. You’re kind of nervous to go to sleep,” she said Wednesday. She expects she won’t be able to work for several weeks, in part because her students may not be able to get to her home.  Other business owners who tried to keep an eye on their companies by watching the video from surveillance cameras ran into the same problems as the veterinary practice.  With all three of Clint Hall’s Beef Jerky Outlet stores near Houston in danger of flooding, he watched from his home in Cypress. The Galveston Island store got a foot of water as the rains continued Monday and Tuesday, but he could see the Tomball location was safe. The League City shop lost power and its cameras on Saturday, so Hall had to rely on the owner of a nearby pizzeria for periodic updates. When the rains finally stopped, it had suffered one minor leak.  It was a hard five days. As Hall watched his cameras, he said, “we’re doing as well as we can.” He planned to open at least two of the stores Wednesday.  Lindsey Rose King spent five days not knowing whether the inventory for Mostess, her home decor gift box company, was safe. The warehouse where it’s all stored — cloth napkins and tablecloths, bottles of spices and cocktail mixes and other items — is in the Galleria section. The warehouse owners had to evacuate their home and couldn’t monitor the situation.  “It’s nerve-wracking. If that inventory gets wet, that’s my whole business,” King said. But Wednesday morning, the email came: Although the building did get some water, King’s merchandise was safe and dry.  Merin Guthrie worried about the possibility that water had seeped into the old loft building near downtown Houston that houses Kit, her clothing design business. Her studio is on the second floor, but friends in similar buildings said they had water coming in through their windows. Even if her fabric, samples and sewing equipment were dry, there was a threat of mold.  She got into the building Wednesday morning, found that water had indeed gotten in, but that her supplies and equipment were OK.  “You have to cross your fingers and hope for the best,” Guthrie said.  _____  Follow Joyce Rosenberg at www.twitter.com/JoyceMRosenberg.

1538,3206,11,8,2017,2017-11-08,Media Matters,Fox News' solution to Tuesday's GOP bloodbath: Candidates should embrace Trump more closely,"  Sarah Wasko / Media Matters    Last night, Republicans were walloped at the ballot box from coast to coast. Ralph Northam won the Virginia governorship for the Democrats, Phil Murphy took back the New Jersey governor’s seat after eight years of GOP control, and down-ballot races in both states look good for team blue. Voters in Maine approved a referendum expanding Medicaid in the state, while in Washington state, a Democratic victory in a key swing district should give the party total majority control of both houses on the state legislature along with the governorship.  There’s no real secret to the nationwide Democratic victories: President Donald Trump is historically unpopular. His administration is shockingly corrupt, two of his top campaign aides were just indicted by a special counsel while a third aide pleaded guilty, his behavior is in turn grotesque, insulting, and authoritarian, most Americans hate his policy priorities, and he’s been unable to get them passed anyway. All this excited Democratic turnout and depressed Republican turnout.  Here in the real world, the president is dragging down his party.  But Trump’s media allies don’t live in the real world. And so, if you turned on Fox last night or this morning, you heard his sycophants saying that the lesson from last night’s Republican wipeout is that the party’s candidates need to hug Trump closer (Trump himself has made the same argument).  On Fox & Friends, one of the president’s favorite shows, co-host Steve Doocy took issue this morning with the idea that the election results were a “Trump rebuke,” saying of the Republican gubernatorial candidates in Virginia and New Jersey, “Neither one of them really brought Donald Trump on board.” “It’s a wake-up call for establishment Republicans,” he added. “If you don’t embrace the leader of your party, why do you want to win and why do you think you can?”  According to Fox host Laura Ingraham last night, Virginia’s Republican gubernatorial nominee, Ed Gillespie, lost because “there is no middle ground with conservative populism. … Maybe Gillespie wouldn’t have won if President Trump campaigned with him, but trying to be half-in, half-out was never going to work. If you dip your toe just in a little bit, you’re going to turn out like Ed Gillespie did, political roadkill.” She also suggested that Gillespie should have campaigned more vigorously on keeping up Confederate memorial statues and “law and order.”  Shortly after announcing Northam’s victory last night, Tucker Carlson said, “It's hard to see Ed Gillespie as a Trump candidate.” He took issues with the “stories in the last week about how he was running on the Trump template.”  When Trump’s friends at Fox weren’t blaming Republican candidates for insufficient fealty to the president, they were trying to ignore the news altogether. All Sean Hannity had to say about the results last night was that they did not come in “states Donald Trump won.” The Fox shows spent significant time talking about the president’s speech in North Korea, the dangers of progressive efforts to prevent gun violence, and the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination fight, as well as reminiscing over Trump’s election a year ago.

Fox’s hosts are signaling that they plan to strap themselves to the mast of Trump’s sinking ship and ride it to the bottom of the ocean.

It would not directly benefit the bottom third of the population. As for the middle class, the benefits appear to be modest.  The administration and its congressional allies are proposing to sharply reduce taxation of business income, primarily benefiting the small share of the population that owns the vast majority of corporate equity. President Trump said on Wednesday that the cuts would increase investment and spur growth, creating broader prosperity. But experts say the upside is limited, not least because the economy is already expanding.  The plan would also benefit Mr. Trump and other affluent Americans by eliminating the estate tax, which affects just a few thousand uber-wealthy families each year, and the alternative minimum tax, a safety net designed to prevent tax avoidance.  The precise impact on Mr. Trump cannot be ascertained because the president refuses to release his tax returns, but the few snippets of returns that have become public show one thing clearly: The alternative minimum tax has been unkind to Mr. Trump.

113,668,9,10,2017,2017-09-10,Associated Press News,China looks at ending sales of gasoline cars," China is joining France and Britain in announcing plans to end sales of gasoline and diesel cars.  China’s industry ministry is developing a timetable to end production and sale of traditional fuel cars and will promote development of electric technology, state media on Sunday cited a Cabinet official as saying.  The reports gave no possible target date, but Beijing is stepping up pressure on automakers to accelerate development of electrics.  China is the biggest auto market by number of vehicles sold, giving any policy changes outsize importance for the global industry.  A deputy industry minister, Xin Guobin, said at an auto industry forum on Saturday his ministry has begun “research on formulating a timetable to stop production and sales of traditional energy vehicles,” according to the Xinhua News Agency and the Communist Party newspaper People’s Daily.  France and Britain announced in July they will stop sales of gasoline and diesel automobiles by 2040 as part of efforts to reduce pollution and carbon emissions that contribute to global warming.  Communist leaders also want to curb China’s growing appetite for imported oil and see electric cars as a promising industry in which their country can take an early lead.  China passed the United States last year as the biggest electric car market. Sales of electrics and gasoline-electric hybrids rose 50 percent over 2015 to 336,000 vehicles, or 40 percent of global demand. U.S. sales totaled 159,620.  The reports of Xin’s comments in the eastern city of Tianjin gave no other details about electric car policy but cited him as saying Beijing plans to “elevate new energy vehicles to a new strategic level.”  Beijing has supported electric development with billions of dollars in research subsidies and incentives to buyers, but is switching to a quota system that will shift the financial burden to automakers.  Under the proposed quotas, electric and hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles would have to make up 8 percent of each automaker’s output next year, 10 percent in 2019 and 12 percent in 2020. Automakers that fail to meet their target could buy credits from competitors that have a surplus.  Beijing has ordered state-owned Chinese power companies to speed up installation of charging stations to increase the appeal of electrics.  Chinese automaker BYD Auto, a unit of battery maker BYD Ltd., is the world’s biggest electric vehicle maker by number of units sold. It sells gasoline-electric hybrid sedans and SUVs in China and markets all-electric taxis and buses in the United States, Europe and Latin America as well as in China.  Volvo Cars, owned by China’s Geely Holding Group, announced plans this year to make electric cars in China for global sale starting in 2019.  General Motors Co., Volkswagen AG and Nissan Motor Co. and others have announced they are launching or looking at joint ventures with Chinese partners to develop and manufacture electric vehicles in China.  ___  Associated Press researcher Fu Ting contributed to this report.",4.75,2,"[5.0, 4.5]"

Daniel Stiles, a self-styled ape trafficking detective in Kenya, had been scouring Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp for weeks, looking for pictures of gorillas, chimps or orangutans. He was hoping to chip away at an illicit global trade that has captured or killed tens of thousands of apes and pushed some endangered species to the brink of extinction.  “The way they do business,” he said of ape traffickers, “makes the Mafia look like amateurs.”  After hundreds of searches, Mr. Stiles found an Instagram account offering dozens of rare animals for sale, including baby chimpanzees and orangutans dressed in children’s clothes. He sent an email to an address on the account — “looking for young otans” (the industry standard slang for orangutans) — and several days later received a reply.  “2 babies, 7.5k each. Special introductory price.”  The trafficker identified himself only as Tom and said he was based in Southeast Asia. Mr. Stiles knew what Tom was hoping for: to sell the infant orangutans to a private collector or unscrupulous zoo, where they are often beaten or drugged into submission and used for entertainment like mindlessly banging on drums or boxing one another. Such ape shows are a growing business in Southeast Asia, despite international regulations that prohibit trafficking in endangered apes.  Several weeks later, after a few more rounds of text messages with Tom to firm up the details, Mr. Stiles decided to fly to Bangkok.  “I was way out on a limb,” Mr. Stiles admitted later.

Speaking just before a Cabinet meeting, Trump took a somber tone in the wake of the vicious attack that left eight dead and a dozen hurt. In addition to vowing to end the State Department's Diversity Immigrant Visa Program, which is how suspect Sayfullo Saipov came into the United States in 2010 from Uzbekistan, Trump called for swift and harsh justice.  “We have to come up with a punishment that much worse than what these animals are getting now,” said Trump, who is asking Congress to end the diversity visa program.  “We have to come up with a punishment that much worse than what these animals are getting now."" — President Trump  Sending Saipov to the military detention facility at Guantanamo Bay would require, at a minimum, classifying him as an enemy combatant, something the White House said on Thursday they consider him to be.  “I believe we would consider this person to be an enemy combatant, yes,” Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, said during Wednesday’s briefing.  Even then, the legality of such a move is not clear, as Saipov was a lawful resident of the U.S. and no terrorist has been sent to Gitmo under such circumstances.  Sanders told reporters that when it comes to sending Saipov to Guantanamo Bay, the president “would support that” but “he wasn’t necessarily advocating for it.”  Saipov, 29, carried out his bloody rampage from behind the wheel of a rented pickup truck, barreling down a bike path along Manhattan's West Side Highway Tuesday afternoon.  Trump took aim Wednesday at the diversity immigration program, as well as others that allow “chain migration,” in which immigrants can enter the country simply to be united with a relative already living here.  The type of visa Saipov possessed could theoretically have allowed dozens of his family members into the U.S.  “We will take all of the necessary steps to take care of our communities and our country has a whole,” Trump also said Wednesday. “What we have now is a joke and a laughingstock.”  The president instead wants foreigners allowed into the country only under merit-based programs.  “We’re so politically correct, we’re afraid to do anything,” he said.  Earlier in the day, congressional Republicans also took aim at the diversity visa program.  “I’ve always been against it because it’s a random system to bring people into the United States,” Texas GOP Rep. Mike McCaul, chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, said Wednesday on Fox News’ “Fox & Friends.”  McCaul said he’s trying to abolish the roughly 25-year-old program and replace it with a merit-based one.  “I think this case just demonstrates why that is absolutely necessary,” he also said.  Saipov was among the maximum 50,000 people allowed into the U.S. every year under the State Department diversity visa program, which tilts toward “countries with historically low rates of immigration.”  McCaul spoke Wednesday just minutes after Trump called for a merit-based only immigration system and in part blamed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other congressional Democrats for the program.  “The terrorist came into our country through what is called the ‘Diversity Visa Lottery Program,’ a Chuck Schumer beauty. I want merit based,” Trump tweeted.  “No more Democratic lottery,” Trump said in a follow-up tweet.  Fox News' Alex Pappas contributed to this report.",2.1,5,"[2.0, 2.5, 4.0, 0.5, 1.5]"

KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo wrote in a note to investors on Friday (Oct. 20) that Apple will only have between 2 million and 3 million iPhone X units available in time for the smartphone's Nov. 3 launch. He believes that by the end of the fourth quarter, Apple's total available iPhone X units will top 25 million to 30 million units, down from a previous estimate of 30 million to 35 million, according to MacRumors, which earlier reported on his predictions.  Apple's iPhone X was announced at the company's iPhone press event last month alongside the iPhone 8. Since its unveiling, the iPhone X has become a hot topic, with consumers even ignoring the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus that launched last month in anticipation of the iPhone X's release.  That lack of demand for the iPhone 8 and widespread demand for the iPhone X might prove to be a problem for Apple. While customers are excited about the prospect of getting an iPhone X, Apple is also having trouble with manufacturing.  In his note to investors, Kuo shed more light on those woes, saying that Apple initially faced problems with a complex circuit board inside the iPhone X and supply chain partner Murata failing to keep pace. After that, Apple had manufacturing problems related to its iPhone X's rear-facing camera, as well as the sensor that will be used to power its Face ID facial scanner.  All of that forced Kuo to reduce his shipment estimates.  However, Kuo also said that the ""worst is behind us,"" according to MacRumors, and he believes Apple is now producing iPhone X units at a much more rapid clip.

Seventy percent of construction firms, many of them small businesses, are have problems finding workers to fill hourly craft positions that are the majority of the construction workforce, according to the survey. Sixty-seven percent predicted it would be hard to fill positions over the next 12 months.

Eighty percent expect women to fill more jobs, in the STEM, or science, technology, engineering and math, fields, and possibly have as many jobs in those fields as men do. And nearly 70 percent expect women to have as many senior executive jobs in corporations as men do, and possibly have more.

Forty-five percent are confident about their local economies, up from 37 percent in a survey last year, and 44 percent are confident about the national economy, up from 25 percent.

Acaba was barely outside an hour when he had to replace one of his safety tethers. Spacewalking astronauts always have more than one of these crucial lifelines in case one breaks. They also wear a jetpack in case all tethers fail and they need to fly back to the space station. (NASA via AP)  CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — A spacewalking astronaut successfully replaced a blurry camera outside the International Space Station on Friday, but had to contend with a balky jetpack and a frayed safety tether.  Both jetpacks and safety ties are crucial for saving a flyaway astronaut.  NASA said Joe Acaba was always securely attached to the orbiting outpost and never in any danger during the nearly seven-hour spacewalk.  But one of his tethers had to be replaced shortly after he and station commander Randy Bresnik floated outside. Mission Control noticed the red lifeline was frayed and worn. Bresnik went back to the air lock to get Acaba a spare.  Then five hours into the spacewalk, Mission Control saw that the right handle on Acaba’s emergency jetpack was popped open — again. Bresnik once more went to his crewmate’s assistance, even offering some tape to keep it down.  After consulting for several minutes in Houston, flight controllers declared the jetpack unreliable and ordered Acaba back inside, once he was done greasing the new robot arm on the space station’s big robot arm. He finished the lube job, then headed in.  Bresnik acknowledged things didn’t go as planned, “with all the stuff that happened today and the challenges we had.” But he thanked everyone for their hard work and diligence.  In the end, only a couple minor chores were left undone.  “Great work today,” Mission Control radioed as the spacewalk came to a close.  It was the third spacewalk in two weeks for U.S. astronauts. Bresnik went out on all three; he was accompanied by Mark Vande Hei to install the new robotic hand on Oct. 5 and lubricate it on Oct. 10.  Each spacewalker wears a jetpack for use in an emergency. It’s available in case an astronaut’s multiple tethers fail and allows the spacewalker to fly back to the station. It’s been tested by orbiting astronauts — years ago — but never called into urgent action.  Earlier, Acaba provided necessary focus to the space station’s robot arm.  He unbolted a blurry camera from the new robotic hand installed two weeks ago. He then popped in a spare, which flight controllers quickly tested from Houston. The replacement provided crisp, clear views.  Sharp focus is essential when the space station’s robot hand grabs an arriving supply ship and anchors it. The next delivery is a few weeks away, prompting the quick camera swap-out.  Orbital ATK, one of NASA’s commercial shippers, plans to launch a cargo ship from Virginia on Nov. 11.  Acaba and the station’s commander, Randy Bresnik, were supposed to go spacewalking earlier this week. But NASA needed extra time to add the camera repair to their chores.  Friday’s spacewalk — expected to be the last one for the year — also saw the astronauts installing a high-definition camera, replacing a fuse and removing thermal insulation from spare electronics. Early next year, astronauts will replace the hand on the opposite side of the 58-foot robot arm, Canada’s main contribution to the space station. The original latching mechanisms are showing wear and tear since the arm’s launch in 2001.  The 250-mile-high complex is currently home to three Americans, two Russians and one Italian.  A one-time high school and middle school teacher, Acaba is the first astronaut of Puerto Rican heritage; his parents were born there. He ventured out on Friday’s spacewalk as the station soared above the hurricane-ravaged island, where much of his extended family lives.  “There’s a whole line of people looking up and smiling today as you get ready to head out the door,” Bresnik told him.",4.6,5,"[5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 5.0, 3.5]"
1178,2773,10,31,2017,2017-10-31,Associated Press News,National security leaders say war authority sufficient,"Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, right, with Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, testifies during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on ""The Authorizations for the Use of Military Force: Administration Perspective"" on Capitol Hill in Washington, Monday, Oct. 30, 2017. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Top U.S. national security officials on Monday warned congressional Republicans and Democrats demanding a new war authorization that existing laws governing combat operations against terrorist groups are legally sufficient and that repealing them prematurely could signal the United States is backing away from the fight.  During testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis urged Congress to tread carefully. If lawmakers are compelled to replace the post-Sept. 11, 2001, laws, the two secretaries cautioned them against imposing restrictions and conditions on American military forces that allow their enemies “to seize the initiative.”  Tillerson and Mattis said President Donald Trump doesn’t have permission from Congress to attack North Korea, but they indicated the U.S. Constitution gives him that power in certain circumstances where U.S. citizens and national security interests are being imminently threatened.  The response troubled several Democrats who have expressed concerns over Trump’s confrontational statements toward North Korea and its budding arsenal of nuclear weapons. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., asked if the act of possessing a nuclear weapon capable of striking the U.S. qualified as an imminent threat, but both witnesses declined to answer.  Senior U.S. national security officials told Congress a new war authorization is not needed to conduct combat operations against terrorist groups and warned repealing current law could signal the U.S. will give up the fight. (Oct. 30)  “Secretaries Tillerson and Mattis’s responses to my questions about the Administration’s war powers in North Korea were very worrying,” Murphy said. “The fact is, no president has unlimited power to start a war without congressional approval.”  Murphy and several other Democrats are planning to introduce legislation that would prohibit Trump from starting a pre-emptive war against North Korea, absent an imminent threat or without express authorization from Congress.  The testimony from Tillerson and Mattis came as the deadly ambush in Niger earlier this month is igniting a push among many lawmakers to update the legal parameters for combat operations overseas.  Roughly 800 U.S. service members are in Niger as part of a French-led mission to defeat the extremists in West Africa. There are hundreds more American forces in other African countries.  The bulk of the nearly three-hour hearing centered on arcane but crucial laws known as authorization for use of military force. One, to fight al-Qaida, was approved a week after the Sept. 11 attacks. A separate authorization for the war in Iraq approved by Congress in 2002 also remains in force.  Tillerson and Mattis said if Congress does pursue a new authorization for foes such as Islamic State militants, it’s imperative the existing laws not be rescinded until a new one is fully in place. Tillerson and Mattis also said any new war authorization, like the existing ones, should not have any geographic or time restrictions so as not to tip the enemy off.  “We cannot put a firm timeline on a conflict against an adaptive enemy who would hope that we haven’t the will to fight as long as necessary,” Mattis said. “Instead we must recognize that we are in an era of frequent skirmishing, and we are more likely to end this fight sooner if we don’t tell our adversary the day we intend to stop fighting.”  A growing number of congressional Republicans and Democrats, many of whom were startled by the depth of the U.S. commitment in Niger and other parts of Africa, have been demanding a new war authorization. They’ve argued that the dynamics of the battlefield have shifted over the past 16 years and it’s past time to replace the post-Sept. 11 authorization to fight al-Qaida with a law that reflects current threats.  Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., highlighted the fact that none of the 21 members of the committee were members of the Senate when the 2001 war authorization was approved. Flake and Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., are sponsoring legislation for a new war authority for operations against the Islamic State group, al-Qaida and the Taliban.  Flake said he understood the reluctance expressed by Mattis and Tillerson not to telegraph when U.S. troops might depart a particular war zone. But he said that concern is “overwhelmed in a big way by not having Congress buy in, and us not having skin in the game.”  “It simply allows us to criticize the administration, Republican or Democrat, if we don’t like what they’re doing because we haven’t weighed in,” Flake said.  U.S. troops also are battling an enemy — Islamic State militants — that didn’t exist 16 years ago in a country — Syria — that the U.S. didn’t expect to be fighting in. Nor did the 2001 authorization anticipate military confrontations with the Syrian government. Trump in April ordered the firing of dozens of Tomahawk missiles at an air base in central Syria, and American forces in June shot down a Syrian Air Force fighter jet.  Beyond that, Trump has approved a troop increase in Afghanistan, the site of America’s longest war, and the U.S. backs a Saudi Arabia-led coalition carrying out airstrikes in Yemen.  But previous attempts to ditch the old authorization and force Congress to craft a new one have failed.  “So far, Congress has been unable to bridge the gap between those who see a new (war authorization) as primarily an opportunity to limit the president and those who believe constraining the commander in chief in wartime is unwise,” said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., the committee chairman. “And unfortunately, the inability to reconcile this divide without threatening the existing authorization has allowed the status quo to prevail.”  ___  Associated Press writers Andrew Taylor and Josh Lederman contributed to this report.  ___  Follow Richard Lardner on Twitter at http://twitter.com/rplardner",3.409090909090909,11,"[5.0, 0.5, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0, 1.5, 0.5]"

1224,2822,11,1,2017,2017-11-01,Vox,New York City terror attack: what we know so far,"A 29-year-old man drove a rental truck into a pedestrian and bike path along the Hudson River in Lower Manhattan in New York City Tuesday, killing eight people and injuring 11 in the deadliest terror attack on the city since 9/11.  Officials have identified the suspect as Sayfullo Saipov, an immigrant who moved to the US legally from Uzbekistan in 2010. He was shot in the abdomen by a New York City police officer at the scene, and is currently in custody at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan. Police have interviewed him and are currently waiting for an update on his condition.  There is not yet any evidence that Saipov had direct connections to or support from terrorist groups, but investigators that the attack was premeditated and inspired by ISIS.  “It appears that Mr. Saipov had been planning this for a number of weeks — he did this in the name of ISIS,” John Miller, the New York deputy police commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism, said at a news briefing on Wednesday. “He appears to have followed, almost exactly to a T, the instructions that ISIS has put out in its social media channels before with instructions to their followers on how to carry out such an attack.”  “It appears he will have some connectivity to individuals who were the subjects of investigations, though he himself was not,"" Miller said.  New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said on Wednesday during an appearance on CNN’s New Day that investigators believe Saipov was a lone wolf who was “radicalized domestically” after coming to the United States.  “After he came to the United States is when he started to become informed about ISIS and radical Islamic tactics,” Cuomo said. “We have no evidence yet of associations or continuing plot or associated plots, and our only evidence to date is that this was an isolated incident that he himself performed.”  According to officials, Saipov left a note in the truck pledging allegiance to ISIS, which said in Arabic, “The Islamic State will endure forever.”  President Trump tweeted on Tuesday night that he has ordered the Department of Homeland of Security to “step up our already Extreme Vetting Program.”  “Being politically correct is fine, but not for this!” he continued.  And on Wednesday, he blamed the attack on immigration policies promoted by Democrats that he thought were too generous.  “The terrorist came into our country through what is called the ‘Diversity Visa Lottery Program,’ a Chuck Schumer beauty. I want merit based,” he tweeted.  What we know  Six people died at the scene, while two others died at a nearby hospital. Five of them were friends from Argentina celebrating a graduation anniversary. An unnamed Belgian woman is also among the dead. Two others remain unidentified.  At around 3:05 pm Tuesday, the suspect drove a pickup truck southbound down the bike path at high speed along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, police officials say.  The truck driver started his rampage near Houston Street, tearing down approximately 20 city blocks on a bike path along the Hudson River popular with cyclists and runners.  The truck came to a stop after it collided with a school bus near Stuyvesant High School, near Chambers Street, officials say. After the crash, the suspect got out of the truck brandishing a paintball and pellet gun.  At least four passengers — two adults and two children — were on the school bus when the pickup driver slammed into it. The children are among the injured.

66,341,6,28,2017,2017-06-28,Vox,"Mark Zuckerberg's probably nonexistent 2020 presidential campaign, explained","If you read media coverage of Mark Zuckerberg’s national tour, it’s easy to get the impression that the Facebook billionaire is running for president. Last week, Zuckerberg visited a truck stop in Iowa. He previously had dinner with an Ohio family and visited a Ford plant in Michigan.  Given the centrality of these three states to presidential politics, and the campaign-like nature of these activities, Zuckerberg’s trip has generated a lot of social media speculation about a possible presidential run. And some well-connected insiders say it’s completely plausible that Zuckerberg would seek the presidency.  “‘He wants to be emperor’ is a phrase that has become common among people who have known him over the years,” technology columnist Nick Bilton wrote in January.  “Most people who are running for president usually declare at this time of the campaign cycle that they’re not,” wrote Minnesota Public Radio’s Bob Collins after Zuckerberg made several stops in the Twin Cities. “And we dutifully report that they say they’re not, forcing you to choose between what they say and your lying eyes.”  But Zuckerberg says he’s not running for office. He says he simply wants to get to know Americans — most of whom are Facebook users — better.  And that’s entirely plausible. After all, the kind of outreach Zuckerberg would do in a presidential campaign isn’t that different from the kind of outreach he’d do if he were simply trying to understand Facebook users better and build public goodwill for his massive social media site.  Zuckerberg has visited 19 states so far  Mark Zuckerberg’s visits to swing states and early primary states — Iowa, Ohio, Michigan, North and South Carolina — have gotten most of the media attention. But if you look at the full map of where Zuckerberg has gone, the picture looks different:  Zuckerberg has visited deep blue states like Washington, Illinois, and Rhode Island and deep red states like Nebraska, Indiana, and Mississippi — none of which vote early in the primary process.  On the other hand, many of the events on his tour had — as the Atlantic’s Adrienne LaFrance puts it — “a campaign-esque vibe.”  “Today we drove down to Waco and stopped in smaller towns along the way,” Zuckerberg wrote about his time in Texas in January. “I had lunch with community leaders in Waxahachie who shared their pride in their home and their feelings on a divided country. I met young moms in West who moved back to their town because they want their kids to be raised with the same values they grew up with. And I met with ministers in Waco who are helping their congregations find deeper meaning in a changing world.”  The Texas swing was one small part of Zuckerberg’s overall trip:  A corporate goodwill tour looks a lot like a presidential campaign  A lot of people think Zuckerberg is preparing for a possible presidential run. Zuck himself denies it, insisting that he’s just trying to get to know the country — and, importantly, American Facebook users — better.  So who’s right? It’s hard to tell because the goals of a presidential campaign and a corporate goodwill tour are actually quite similar. A presidential candidate wants to meet a lot of ordinary voters so he can learn more about their thoughts and concerns. He also wants to be seen as meeting with a lot of ordinary voters. When a presidential candidate meets with a truck driver, assembly line worker, or teacher, he seems a little more relatable to every other truck driver, assembly line worker, and teacher in the country.  As the CEO of one of the world’s most influential companies, Zuckerberg has a lot of the same concerns. Most Americans are Facebook users, so almost every meeting Zuckerberg has helps him understand Facebook users better. And if he can make himself well-liked by the public, that public goodwill will make it easier for Facebook to weather future controversies.  And that’s important because it’s practically guaranteed that a company of Facebook’s size and influence will eventually come under public scrutiny. Already, the company has faced criticism (from Vox and others) for the proliferation of fake news on its platform, and people have blasted Facebook for doing too little to scrub violent videos from the site.  There’s no way a company of Facebook’s size and influence can completely forestall this kind of controversy. But having a CEO with an earnest, folksy public persona can serve as a valuable insurance policy when the inevitable controversies come up. People are far more likely to cut a company slack if they believe its CEO is someone who cares about ordinary people and tries to do the right thing.  And that’s why it’s hard to say if Zuckerberg’s travels this year are an unannounced presidential campaign or merely a corporate goodwill tour. The two projects have such similar goals that we should expect them to look similar in execution.  And in a recent tweetstorm, former Ticketmaster CEO Nathan Hubbard suggests another reason Zuckerberg may have undertaken his national tour.  “Zuck woke up on Nov 9th acutely aware that FB had facilitated a new shift he didn't foresee or understand,” Hubbard tweeted. “That's terrifying to a founder.”  Hubbard argues that Zuckerberg woke up after Donald Trump’s election and realized that he didn’t understand American Facebook users as well as he thought he did. Critics charged that Facebook had facilitated the spread of fake news that may have contributed to Trump’s victory.  So, Hubbard says, Zuckerberg has “ventured out into the world beyond his bubble to do field research.” He’s trying to meet as many Facebook users as possible — from as many backgrounds as possible — to help shape his thinking as he considers how to improve Facebook in the next few years.",1.5,1,[1.5]
1569,3242,11,9,2017,2017-11-09,Vox,A new study compared opioids and over-the-counter painkillers in ERs. Opioids didn’t do so well.,"For years, doctors have deployed opioids in emergency room settings as a standard response to severe acute pain. A new study, however, is questioning that practice in some cases.  The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association this month by researchers at Albany Medical College and Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, looked at four alternative approaches to acute pain in an emergency department: three treatments with opioids and one with over-the-counter, non-opioid painkillers. The researchers concluded that “there were no statistically significant or clinically important differences in pain reduction at 2 hours” between the opioid treatments and the non-opioid variant.  In other words, the kind of pain studied — acute shoulder, arm, hip, or leg pain in an emergency room setting — was treated equally well with non-opioids as it was with opioids. That’s promising, given that opioids generally carry greater risks in terms of addiction, misuse, and overdose — as the nation’s opioid epidemic has shown.  Now, the study does not say that opioids have no place in pain care. Andrew Chang, the lead author of the study, told me he’s worried that in the response to the opioid crisis, we may overcorrect and limit opioids too much. “I do also worry that we might be swinging the pendulum too far in the other direction,” he wrote in an email, “and I hope we don’t end up creating arbitrary regulatory restrictions that prevent patients who appropriately need opioids from receiving opioids.”  But his research demonstrates that it may be possible to cut back on the amount of opioids used in at least some acute pain care settings without inflicting harm. As policymakers and health care providers respond to the opioid epidemic, that’s good to know.  What the study found  The study looked at more than 400 patients going to the Montefiore Medical Center in Bronx, New York, for acute extremity pain from bone fractures, dislocated shoulders, sprained ankles, and other injuries or conditions.  The patients were then randomly divided into four groups, with each group getting a different combination of drugs to treat their pain. The non-opioid group got 400 mg of ibuprofen and 1,000 mg of acetaminophen, which are often sold over the counter as Advil and Tylenol, respectively. The opioid groups got 5 mg of oxycodone and 325 mg of acetaminophen, 5 mg of hydrocodone and 300 mg of acetaminophen, or 30 mg of codeine and 300 mg of acetaminophen.  On a scale of zero to 10, the patients in the study reported, on average, an initial pain score of 8.7, with no significant differences between the groups. One and two hours later, they reported their pain scores after getting their assigned medication.  Across all groups, patients’ pain scores fell over the two hours: by 4.3 in the ibuprofen and acetaminophen group, 4.4 in the oxycodone and acetaminophen group, 3.5 in the hydrocodone and acetaminophen group, and 3.9 in the codeine and acetaminophen group. The reductions were statistically equivalent across all four groups.  “Some (not all) physicians reflexively think fractures require opioids, but this study lends evidence that opioids are not always necessary even in the presence of fractures,” Chang told me, cautioning that there are likely exceptions for worse and more complicated injuries.  The study was a randomized clinical trial, which is considered the gold standard for medical research. When I asked Stanford drug policy expert Keith Humphreys, who was not involved in the research, what he thought of it, he said that it was a “[g]ood study in a good journal.”  There were limitations in the study. For one, the findings only apply to this specific emergency room setting and over two hours. The researchers also explicitly excluded chronic conditions, such as sickle cell disease, because they wanted to focus on acute pain. More research will be needed to see not just if the study’s findings can be replicated, but also if they apply to other settings, other conditions, or over greater periods of time.  Another big caveat: Even if future studies produce similar findings, that does not mean that everyone will be able to use non-opioids for acute pain. As Chang told me, “[I]t’s important to recognize that the lack of a difference in our study among the four groups is on average, and that any individual patient might receive better pain relief with a particular analgesic.” In short, just because something might be generally true does not mean it can apply to every single individual.  For example, patients who require more pain relief may benefit from a higher dose of opioids than what was provided in the study. Chang’s study used a fairly high dose of ibuprofen and acetaminophen; anything higher could risk serious health problems, since ibuprofen can be hard on the kidneys, among other side effects. But the doses used in the opioid groups, while common in ER settings, weren’t close to the maximum safe dose, so they could be scaled up with fewer potential health risks than the ibuprofen-acetaminophen combination.  Kidney donors or people with kidney disease would also likely benefit more from the opioids. Any loss in kidney function makes ibuprofen inadvisable, so it might be better for these types of patients to get opioids regardless of what the study found.  And for patients in end-of-life care, it’s possible that opioids are simply better because the risk of addiction is, frankly, not a very big concern for someone who is terminally ill. So it might be better to use what can be more easily scaled up to higher doses.  Other caveats may apply, depending on the kinds of conditions and circumstances that a patient is going to the hospital with.  The study also did not measure adverse effects. The researchers pointed to another that did: A “similar [emergency department]-based study lasting 90 minutes had an incidence of adverse events of 1.6% in the codeine group, 3.3% in the nonopioid group, and 16.9% in the oxycodone group, with lightheadedness accounting for 70% of adverse events in the oxycodone group.” But since that study used higher doses for opioids than Chang’s research, the findings aren’t comparable to what Chang and his colleagues found.  So the study isn’t the final word. Still, it gives promising insight in a crucial area of public health.  We can pull back on opioids without doing harm  This research falls under the shadow of the opioid epidemic. The current overdose crisis has over time changed to involve all kinds of opioids — painkillers, heroin, and fentanyl. But it originally began with the overprescription of opioid painkillers, which allowed the supply of the prescription drugs to explode. That led opioids to proliferate, landing in the hands of not just patients but also teens rummaging through their parents’ medicine cabinets, other family members, friends of patients, and the black market. (More on the opioid epidemic’s causes and evolution in Vox’s explainer.)  The crisis has led policymakers and health care providers to look at cutting back on prescription opioids. But this comes with a challenge: Policymakers and health care providers also want to make sure that the drugs are available to patients who truly need them.  The study shows that this really might be possible, at least in the kind of emergency room setting that the researchers looked at. If nothing else, it should lead some doctors to rethink the default mode they might have when it comes to acute pain — to always reach for the opioid.  As Chang told me, “If we can administer a combination of non-opioids to patients while they are in the [emergency department] and show them (as well as the treating physician) that it provides comparable pain relief to opioids, then the patient will likely be more accepting of a non-opioid upon discharge, and the physician may feel less pressure to prescribe an opioid.”  Several weeks ago, I underwent surgery for a minor heart condition. (Don’t worry; I’m not going to die — yet, anyway.) In my hospital room, I reported my pain score after the procedure as a six out of 10, and I was vocally resistant to getting opioids. The nurses gave me opioids anyway. I turned out fine, as most people who get opioids in these settings do. But Chang’s study suggests I could have been just as fine if I got a high dose of ibuprofen and acetaminophen instead. Yet there seemed to be a bias in favor of the opioids.  In general, this is what the response to the opioid epidemic has been about: weakening that bias in favor of opioids for treating pain — while ensuring that patients who truly need opioids can still get them.  This applies to chronic pain as well. The evidence for opioids treating chronic pain is very weak (despite their effectiveness for acute pain), while the evidence that opioids cause harm in the long term is very strong. And a recent study found that doctors can wean some chronic pain patients off opioids and actually improve their pain outcomes. More research is needed in this area, but the current evidence suggests that the risks of opioids might not be worth the gains, if there actually are any, for most chronic pain patients.  As with acute pain, that does not mean opioids will never be useful in chronic pain cases. When prescribed carefully on a schedule that works to diminish the excessive buildup of tolerance, they can work for some people. Stanford pain specialist Sean Mackey previously told me that opioids should not be a first-line treatment due to the risks, and alternatives should be tried first — but they can work for some chronic pain patients, and keeping them from such patients can cause unnecessary harm and suffering.  So opioid policy, as with many public health issues, is a balancing act. But studies like Chang’s and other research suggest that it is possible to moderate our opioid use and not inflict unnecessary harm on patients. That could be a crucial step in confronting the ongoing drug epidemic and preventing more crises like it in the future.",3.0,1,[3.0]

Known as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, it is widely considered the terrorist group’s most dangerous worldwide affiliate, with a particular focus on trying to blow up commercial airliners.  Here and elsewhere in the country’s central and southern regions, American-backed Yemeni forces have been waging a shadow war against more than 3,000 members of the Qaeda affiliate and their tribal fighters. Since Feb. 28, the United States has conducted more than 100 airstrikes against Qaeda militants in Yemen, according to the Pentagon, nearly three times the total for all of last year.  The Yemenis in recent weeks have also captured some important Qaeda operatives. Their interrogations have given the Yemeni forces and their American and Emirati partners valuable insights into the insurgents’ leadership hierarchy, propaganda plans and local networks, a United States official said.  Here in Azzan, Mr. Wahidi said that residents had been tipped off about the impending attack by homegrown troops in the advancing force. “Those are our sons,” Mr. Wahidi said as he reclined on a hard pillow and chewed khat, the narcotic leaves widely consumed in Yemen and the Horn of Africa. “Most of the soldiers graduated from Azzan secondary school.”  The night before, residents said, warplanes hovered over the town and dropped flash bombs at suspected Qaeda militants gathering in the nearby mountains. Ahead of their arrival, the Yemeni troops also fired machine guns that rocked the town, another tactic to scare the militants.",4.0,4,"[3.5, 5.0, 4.0, 3.5]"
92,526,6,20,2017,2017-06-20,Vox,Apple’s anti-leaking strategy just leaked,"Apple wages a constant war on leakers designed to ensure it can unveil new products on its own terms. But the leaks never seem to stop, and it’s evident they won’t anytime soon.  The Outline’s William Turton obtained a leaked recording of an Apple presentation on Apple’s anti-leaking efforts, hilariously highlighting how difficult it can be to stop leaks.  The presentation reveals the elaborate steps Apple takes to safeguard the secrecy of its products. Apple has recruited a large team of anti-leak investigators, including people who previously worked at the National Security Agency, the FBI, and the Secret Service. One investigation lasted for three years.  “These investigations go on a long time,” Lee Freedman, who was an assistant US attorney before leading Apple’s investigation team, said in the recording. “We don't take a defeatist mentality and say, 'Oh well, it's going to leak anyways.’” In one case, Apple pursued a case for three years before identifying the leaker.  One of Apple’s big challenges has been leaks from manufacturing facilities in China. To prevent these leaks, Apple requires Chinese workers to be searched as they enter and leave factories where Apple products are made. In the recording, an Apple official bragged that Apple screens more people than the TSA: “Their peak volume is 1.8 million a day. Ours, for just 40 factories in China, is 2.7 million a day.”  Apple has less draconian, but still extensive, security procedures at its American campuses.  Apple’s brass believes that all this secrecy helps the company’s bottom line. Early leaks of a forthcoming product could discourage customers from buying Apple products that are already on store shelves. And the surprise of a big Apple product reveal makes news organizations more likely to cover it.  At the same time, it’s hard to be sure if any of this really matters. Apple loyalists are going to buy a new Apple product sooner or later. And Apple is such a prominent brand that there’s little risk of customers not hearing about a new Apple product.",3.5,1,[3.5]
402,1747,10,8,2017,2017-10-08,Vox,White House to Congress: we'll legalize DACA recipients if you crack down on most other immigrants,"When President Donald Trump announced the end of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program in September, he said he was giving Congress six months to find a legislative solution that would allow the 690,000 young unauthorized immigrants currently protected from deportation under DACA to stay in the country legally.  It turns out his White House has very specific ideas about what they want that solution to be.  They are “not interested in granting citizenship” to current DACA recipients, for example, according to a senior administration official on a Sunday night press call — despite the support by Democrats and many Congressional Republicans for doing just that.  And in exchange for allowing DACA recipients to get some sub-citizenship legal status, the White House wants a comprehensive immigration crackdown.  Its written list of immigration “principles,” released Sunday night, doesn’t say anything about the citizenship question, but it includes a kitchen sink of immigration restrictions. The White House wants the construction of a border wall, changes to federal law to make it much harder for people to seek asylum in the US, to make the E-Verify employment verification system mandatory, and to prevent US citizens and permanent residents from bringing over family members other than spouses and minor children as immigrants to the US.  The Trump administration is essentially asking for Congress to enact Trump’s entire immigration platform from the 2016 campaign, and then some.  The whole proposal is a total 180 from the “deal” that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi declared they had struck with Trump after a meeting three weeks ago, in which Trump allegedly agreed to sign a bill that legalized DREAMers in response for some undefined demands on border security. The White House has maintained that Trump agreed to no such deal, but the episode (and Trump’s tweets promising to help DREAMers) made it seem that the president was willing to sign a bill that offered citizenship to DACA recipients without asking too much in exchange.  This document makes it clear that at least someone in the White House is, to the contrary, asking for a whole lot.  The question is whether these are demands, and Trump will veto any bill that helps DREAMers without meeting some or any of these priorities; or whether they are simply the opening bid in a negotiation in which the White House seeks to secure significant border-security concessions from Democrats in exchange for a permanent DACA fix.  Administration officials weren’t exactly clear about this on Sunday. At one point, an official said that the White House was hoping to “begin an earnest conversation.” But the letter sent to congressional leaders outlining the principles — signed by Trump himself — says that the document outlines “reforms that must be included as part of any legislation addressing the status of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients.”  There’s a big difference between the two.  If this is simply the beginning of a conversation, it’s unlikely that most of these priorities would make it into a final deal. Not only do they represent an immigration position to the right of many Republicans (especially if the White House actively opposes citizenship for DACA recipients), but they are demands being made by a White House that has something of a track record of caving to Congress.  But if these are demands, they kill any hope that Congress will be able to pass a bill to protect DACA recipients by March 5 — or ever.  The White House’s immigration principles are uncompromising in their immigration hawkery  The principles laid out by the White House are comprehensive and detailed, and it would take a lot more space to go through all of them. But here are some of the most ambitious proposals that the White House sees as a “priority” in exchange for any legalization of DREAMers.  Building the wall. The first priority listed in the White House’s executive summary is to “Fund and complete construction of the southern border wall.” What that actually means is deliberately unclear; acting Border Patrol Chief Ron Vitello said on Sunday that Congress and Border Patrol needed to work out exactly what would be built and where. The White House has occasionally used “wall” to describe existing border fencing, and has acknowledged that some (perhaps a lot) of the US/Mexico border doesn’t need a total physical barrier. But Democrats in Congress have made it clear time and again that they have no interest in giving money to anything called a “wall,” and it’s the first thing that Schumer and Pelosi pointed to as evidence that Trump was violating the still-vague “deal” they believe they made with the president last month.  Cracking down on asylum-seekers — particularly Central American children and families. Administration officials pushed the talking point on Sunday night that border security didn’t just mean apprehending everyone who crossed into the US without papers, but being able to deport them quickly after they were caught. Their biggest obstacle to doing that now is that many of those people aren’t trying to sneak into the US — they’re coming to seek asylum. And current US law makes it much harder for the government to detain and deport asylum-seekers, especially if they have or are children.  The White House wants Congress to close what it calls legal “loopholes” in the asylum process: making it possible to deport immigrants under the age of 18 back to Central America without a court hearing; allowing the government to detain children in regular, jail-style immigration detention facilities along with their parents; and tightening the standards for when an immigrant can stay in the US to pursue an asylum case. These are requests that have come up occasionally from Republicans ever since the 2014 child migrant crisis, but Democrats tend to worry that they’d result in people being deported back to mortal danger — and could run afoul of international law.  Requiring employers to use the E-Verify system to check that anyone they’re hiring is legally allowed to work in the US. Short of mass deportation, the most aggressive thing the federal government could do to crack down on the 11 million unauthorized immigrants currently in the US would be to require all employers to use the E-Verify system to check the legal status of anyone they’ve hired or are hiring. While the E-Verify system has well-documented problems (both in terms of falsely identifying legal workers as “illegal” and failing to catch unauthorized immigrants), making it universal could still kick millions of unauthorized immigrants out of work or force them into the underpaid underground economy. E-Verify hasn’t been a priority for the Trump administration before now, but “requiring E-Verify” is one of the priorities it lists as part of any DACA deal.  Severely restricting family-based legal immigration. The RAISE Act — the Trump-endorsed bill that would cut legal immigration in half over the next decade — isn’t in the White House’s principles document by name. But the White House isn’t abandoning the idea: It wants Congress to end “chain migration” of family members, and replace it with a “merit-based” immigration system. Specifically, US Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Lee Francis Cissna called on Congress to limit family-based legal migration to minor children and spouses of US citizens and legal permanent residents — preventing citizens from bringing over their parents, adult children, or siblings.  Many Republicans have expressed support for decreasing family-based immigration; while the RAISE Act wasn’t terribly appealing to many Republicans in Congress (perhaps because of the strictness of its restrictions on even “merit-based” immigration), it’s possible that most Republicans could get on board with something else that fits the White House’s requirements here. But Democrats — who tend to believe that it’s important for immigrants to be able to keep their families together — would probably consider this proposal a deal breaker on its own. And they certainly aren’t going to take kindly to it in addition to pages more of demands.",3.057142857142857,35,"[3.5, 3.0, 2.0, 3.5, 2.5, 5.0, 3.0, 0.5, 0.5, 4.5, 5.0, 2.0, 0.5, 4.5, 1.5, 1.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.5, 1.5, 5.0, 4.5, 5.0, 0.5, 4.0, 5.0, 4.5, 1.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 2.5, 2.5, 1.0, 5.0]"

(AP Photo/Petros Giannakouris)  ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Canadian mining company Eldorado Gold on Monday threatened to suspend a major investment in Greece in 10 days, accusing the government of delaying permits and licenses.  One of Greece’s largest foreign investors, Eldorado operates mines in northern Greece that have faced vehement opposition from parts of local communities on environmental grounds, with protests often turning violent.  “This decision is not one that we have taken lightly,” Eldorado President and CEO George Burns told reporters in Athens, noting the company has made a $3 billion-investment in the country.  A company announcement said it would continue maintenance and environmental safeguards, but would make no further investment in three mines in the Halkidiki area of northern Greece and two projects in the northeastern province of Thrace.  It said the permit delays “have negatively impacted Eldorado’s project schedules and costs, ultimately hindering the company’s ability to effectively advance development and operation of these assets.”  Burns said the company’s decision will take effect on Sept. 21 unless Eldorado receives the permits.  “Approvals must not be held hostage to political posturing or other agendas put forward by a vocal minority,” he said. “I keep hearing the permits are coming, but they’re not coming in a timely fashion.”  But Environment Minister Giorgos Stathakis said European and national law had to be upheld, and that the company had still not completed all necessary procedures, including completing an investment plan detailing production methods.  He also said some pending permits were scheduled to be given in mid-September for six months, allowing the company to operate during the arbitration process.  “The company’s choices toward the employees are clearly their responsibility,” Stathakis said. “We are witnesses of an extraordinary event, of a company that through its CEO holds press conferences and makes statements judging prime ministers, ministers and political parties in Greece.”  Burns said the company was unable to legally continue work without the permits, adding he was open to dialogue and hoped to have the issue resolved in time.  This is not the first time Eldorado has suspended operations in Greece. In January 2016, it had threatened to suspend work at one of its sites and lay off 600 workers following protests by local residents and a spat with the government. Work restarted several months later.  Burns said he had sent three letters to Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras during the last five months, since he took over the helm of Eldorado, but had not received any reply.  Eldorado employs some 2,400 staff and contractors in Greece through its local subsidiary, Hellas Gold. The company said 90 percent of the workers faced being suspended temporarily from their jobs if the permits don’t come through in time.  The company took over old mines in 2012, paying nearly $2 billion. Burns said it had since invested a further $1 billion in Greece, a figure which would double if the company could fully develop its assets in Greece.  Monday’s action comes as Greece struggles to emerge from years of a deep financial crisis and attract investment.  Interior Minister Panos Skourletis said disagreements would be resolved through arbitration. The company, however, counters it has not been officially informed of what the arbitration would be about.  “This might be a move to (exert) political pressure on the government at a crucial time,” Skourletis said.  He insisted Greece was friendly toward foreign investments, but that the Canadian project, being a mining operation, was a special case.  “Such kinds of investments no longer exist in the rest of Europe. They’re not allowed due to the great environmental cost they have,” he said. “So it’s wrong to connect this particular case with the general picture in the area of investments (in Greece).”  The Halkidiki mines have been mired in controversy for decades, with Eldorado’s predecessors also facing protests.  Many in the local communities vehemently oppose mining development on environmental grounds, saying it would hurt the area’s tourism industry, destroy forests risk contaminating the groundwater.  The company counters it’s carrying out environmental cleanup work even of its predecessors, and rejects accusations of pollution. It noted that Greece’s Council of State, the country’s highest administrative court, had issued 18 decisions in its favor in various permit disputes.  Burns said he remained optimistic that a solution could be found. “I’m confident these mines will be built,” he said.  When first elected on an anti-bailout platform in 2015, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’ left-wing government initially favored the suspension of the permits that had previously been granted to the mining company.  Greece’s confederation of industries urged Tsipras to personally intervene to rescue the gold mine investment.  Nikos Panairlis, head of the workers’ union at one of the mines, described the company’s move as “a catastrophe for us,” adding that workers were looking to organize protests.  The mood among opponents of the mine was cautious. Aristotelis municipality mayor Giorgos Zoumbas accused Eldorado of “using the workers and their jobs to blackmail and get the permits.”  Local residents, he said, would be happy if the suspension goes ahead, “but they’re still cautious.”  ___  Derek Gatopoulos in Athens and Costas Kantouris in Thessaloniki, Greece contributed to this report.  ___  Follow Becatoros http://www.twitter.com/ElenaBec",1.75,2,"[1.0, 2.5]"

The billionaire posted on a picture on Twitter on Saturday evening showing the tunnel dug by The Boring Company, an infrastructure company he founded. The goal of The Boring Company (a play on words), is to build a series of underground tunnels that can transport cars and help alleviate traffic.  Musk is starting with a route to Los Angeles, from SpaceX's headquarters in Hawthorne, throughout the rest of the city, one which is considered the most congested in the continental U.S.  ELON MUSK SHOWS OFF BORING COMPANY ELEVATOR FOR THE FIRST TIME  In 2016, Drivers in LA spent on average 81 hours in traffic, according to a story in The Los Angeles Times, which obtained the survey from data company Inrix.  In a separate tweet, Musk added that that the tunnel is 500 feet so far, but should be ""2 miles long in three or four months and hopefully stretch the whole 405 N-S corridor from [Los Angeles International Airport] LAX to the 101 in a year or so.""  In August, The Boring Company received approval by the city of Hawthorne (a city in southwestern Los Angeles County) to build the tunnel. The tunnel operates using electric skates, so that cars can move along swiftly.  In July, Musk showed off the elevator that would take cars from the congested roads to the underground network of tunnels.  In addition to the tunnel under LA, The Boring Company is also looking to have tunnels in other cities, including one stretching from Baltimore to New York (stopping in Washington and Philadelphia), as well as Chicago and other U.S. cities.  In addition to being CEO of The Boring Company, Musk is also the CEO of electric vehicle company Tesla, space exploration company SpaceX.

648,2047,10,11,2017,2017-10-11,Vox,Trump is a real-world political science experiment,"President Donald Trump is a Republican. But often, and more so than any president in memory, he lacks a consistent political ideology.  During the campaign, Trump took five different positions on abortion in three days. On other issues, his policy preferences have been clear as mud: “I don’t want to have guns in classrooms, although in some cases, teachers should have guns in classrooms, frankly,” he told Fox News in 2016.  And where he is more consistent — like in his deference to Russian President Vladimir Putin, most stunningly in the recent joint press conference in Helsinki — he is often at odds with many prominent figures in his own party.  All this makes this period of history extremely interesting for political scientists and psychologists to study.  “We’ve never had a federal elected official, let alone the leader of a party or the president of the United States, who is so easily moved from one position to another without offering any sort of justification or apology or explanation,” Michael Barber, a political scientist at Brigham Young University, said last year.  “It’s very hard to find instances where prior policy views seem to drive later voting or decisions”  Researchers like him have long tried to understand the power of leaders and the willingness of the public to hold them accountable. And rarely do they get a real-life experiment like Trump to help them answer some huge questions at the heart of democracy:  How much power do presidents have in swaying public opinion? Will the base always follow even if a president swings wildly from one position to another?  And there’s another key question at play here that matters a lot for the future of Trump’s presidency: If prominent Republican leaders start breaking away from Trump because they don’t like his ideas or temperament, will the base also break?  In essence, Trump is providing an unprecedented opportunity to test the “follow the leader” theory of political science — and to see if Trump will push his followers to a breaking point.  The research here predicts there won’t be a pivotal moment where Republicans around the country stop supporting Trump en masse. Polls show it too. An Axios/SurveyMonkey poll released July 19 found that 79 percent of Republicans approved of Trump’s press conference with Putin. And they approved despite the overwhelmingly negative press that followed it, and even after prominent Republicans — like Sen. John McCain, a former GOP presidential nominee — were harshly critical.  Voters will follow their leader. Trump gives political scientists the chance to find out how far.  A recent experiment found Republicans are more likely to adopt liberal policies when Trump supports liberal policies  Yes, Trump has been extremely consistent in some areas: He’s made policies that make it harder for people who live in Muslim-majority nations to enter the United States, he shares Republican animosity toward Obamacare, and he’s reducing the role of the Environmental Protection Agency and other federal agencies. But for a president, Trump is historically scattershot.  In January 2017, Barber and his BYU colleague Jeremy Pope designed an experiment to take advantage of that fact. Its publication is forthcoming in the political science journal the Forum. In their test, they wondered: Are Trump’s supporters ideological, or will they follow him wherever his policy whims go? Right after Trump’s inauguration, they ran an online experiment with 1,300 Republicans.  The study was pretty simple. Participants were asked to rate whether they supported or opposed policies like a higher minimum wage, the nuclear agreement with Iran, restrictions on abortion access, background checks for gun owners, and so on. These are the types of issues conservatives and liberals tend to be sharply divided on.  Barber and Pope wondered: Would Republicans be more likely to endorse a liberal policy if they were told Donald Trump supported it?  One-third of the participants read statements where they were told Trump supported a liberal position, like this:  Please indicate whether or not you support or oppose the statement. To increase the minimum wage to over $10 an hour. Donald Trump has said that he supports this policy. How about you? Do you support or oppose increasing the minimum wage to over $10 an hour? Support Oppose Don’t know  The control group of the experiment saw these questions, but they didn’t mention Trump. And another arm of the experiments tested what happened when Trump was said to support conservative policies.  The answer: “On average, across all of the questions that we asked, when presented with a liberal policy, Republicans became about 15 percentage points more likely to support that liberal policy” when they were told Trump supported it, Pope says. They follow their leader. “The conclusion we should draw is that the public, the average Republican sitting out there in America, is not going to stop Trump from doing whatever he wants.” The effect even held true on questions about immigration. If Trump supported a lax immigration policy, his supporters said they did too.  Past experiments with liberal participants have found a similar effect: Liberals are more likely to support conservative policies when told their leaders support conservative policies. And even creepier: other research in psychology finds that people aren’t always consciously aware when they change their minds in this manner. That is, it’s possible we forget what we once believed when our ideological stances change.  It’s important to note that not everyone is so easily swayed by their leaders. In their study, Barber and Pope found the people most likely to follow Trump’s lead were those who didn’t know much about politics but still strongly identified as Republicans. The most knowledgeable in their sample were hardly swayed at all. To a certain extent, the effect may be the result of people not thinking too hard when filling out a questionnaire. But then again, that’s how most of us come to our political opinions: by not thinking too hard about them.  There are real-life examples of this leadership-down process of opinion that go back years. In 1971, Republican President Richard Nixon made a surprise decision to impose a 90-day freeze on wages and prices (to halt inflation, a move that runs counter to conservative economic policy), and even ardent conservative supporters followed suit.  “A Columbia survey ... found a 45-point increase from 32 percent to 82 percent ‘virtually overnight’ among Republican activists — precisely the people who ought to have been most resistant to the policy shift on ideological grounds,” explains Larry Bartels, a political scientist at Vanderbilt University and a leading expert on how public opinion forms.  Other research has found that many of us will change our opinions after merely learning that a leader supports an idea.  In 2014, political scientists David Broockman and Daniel Butler conducted a field experiment where they had real state legislators’ offices send letters to constituents who the researchers knew, via another survey, disagreed with the legislators’ policies. The letters simply stated what the legislators believed. A control group got no letters. The letters were sent by Democratic lawmakers, but they didn’t state their affiliation in the letters.  The letters — sent to people regardless of the political affiliation — made a small but meaningful effect. They “caused the voters who disagreed with the legislator to become about 6.5 percentage points more likely to agree with the legislator,” Broockman and Butler wrote.  A follow-up experiment added another variable to the mix: Some of the constituents got letters that contained lengthy explanations of their leaders’ policy views. Others just got short summary statements. And “constituents who received lengthy arguments from legislators justifying their positions were just as likely to change their opinions as constituents to whom legislators provided little justification,” they wrote.  The experiment is a demonstration that it doesn’t take all that much to get voters to flip-flop their political opinions. They might not even realize they’re doing it at all.  Trump may have caused some massive swings in public opinion among Republicans  Consider this recent one.  In 2015, just 12 percent of Republicans held a favorable view of Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to Gallup. It’s not surprising this figure was so low. Just three years earlier, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney had declared Russia to be our “top geopolitical foe.”  Flash-forward to 2017. Then, 32 percent of Republicans had a favorable view of Putin, according to Gallup. That’s a huge jump. And during that time, if anything, Putin lived up to Romney’s prediction.  What changed in just two years? Donald Trump, and his reluctance to criticize the Russian leader.  Or take the issue of free trade: Typically conservatives are in favor of it. It lowers costs for American businesses that want to outsource labor or buy materials from overseas.  “Since Donald Trump entered the 2016 presidential campaign by descending a golden escalator, Republican support for free trade has similarly declined,” Barber and Pope write in their paper. As Pew finds, from 2015 to 2017, Republican support of free trade plummeted from 56 percent in support in 2015 to just 36 percent in 2017.  Trump has massive power to sway public opinion among his followers.  In March 2017, a CBS poll found that 47 percent of Americans — and a full 74 percent of Republicans surveyed — believed it’s “likely” or “somewhat likely” that President Trump’s offices were wiretapped during the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump had tweeted that “Obama had my ‘wires tapped’ in Trump Tower” during the campaign. But there was no credible evidence this happened.  Since then, it was revealed that Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort had been under surveillance, which confuses the matter. Still, Trump said it happened, and many believed.  And there’s an opposite of the follower-the-leader effect at play too. When Trump takes a position on something, liberals are sure to oppose it. Vox’s Matthew Yglesias has documented these swings in public opinion here.  Very few people have stable policy views. They do have stable party affiliations.  We have a vision of democracy where a virtuous public steers the decisions of leaders, Barber says. But over and over again in experiments — and in the real world — that vision turns out to be a mirage.  The researchers I spoke to admit there’s a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem in this research. Can we really know that Trump caused the change of opinion on free trade, or did Republican voters change their minds and then endorse an anti-free trade candidate?  Both seem to be going on. But there’s a compelling case that Trump caused it.  Gabriel Lenz, a political scientist at UC Berkeley and author of Follow the Leader? How Voters Respond to Politicians' Performance and Policies, has analyzed decades’ worth of data from the American National Election Studies, a long-running study assessing voter preferences and knowledge about politics. The study data allows Lenz to track the very same voters over decades of political change.  One of the biggest findings in all this data: Voters aren’t all that knowledgeable about politics. Lenz finds only 50 percent of the public can accurately match policy preferences to the correct party or candidate. And about 20 to 40 percent of the public holds stable views on policy, Lenz finds in a forthcoming paper in the Journal of Politics.  “A lot of people don’t know how the parties describe themselves,” he says. “And when they learn my party’s conservative [or is against free trade, etc.], they start saying they’re conservative too. ... It’s very hard to find instances where prior policy views seem to drive later voting or decisions.”  A lot of us are like Trump in that regard.  In his research, Lenz finds some people are more likely to be consistent on certain topics, like marijuana legalization, abortion access, and anything related to racial identity. But overall, “we have ample evidence that people are amazingly good at ignoring contradictions.” People can say they support free trade one year and say they’re against it the next, and not really notice their opinion has changed.  That’s partly because when people answer public opinion polls, they rely on mental shortcuts. They may replace a hard question (“How do I feel about international trade taxes?”) with an easy question (“What team am I on, and how would they answer this question?”).  “These shortcuts can be political ideology; it could be religiosity, deference to scientific authority,” Dominique Brossard, a psychologist who studies public opinion at the University of Wisconsin, said in an interview last year. “People don’t see themselves as being irrational doing this.”  One reason Trump is particularly influential: he’s a “toxic meme” machine  Trump has a powerful ability to sway opinions among his base — and create polarized opinions among his detractors. We see this play out all the time.  Think about the fall 2017 fracas calling out NFL players protesting the national anthem.  If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL,or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2017  ...our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not, YOU'RE FIRED. Find something else to do! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2017  The message to Trump’s base is clear: Only ungrateful un-Americans would dare protest the national anthem. His supporters — many of whom perhaps haven’t even been paying attention to the anthem controversy — will believe that too.  When Trump comes out with a strong opinion on a subject, it’s a signal to his base saying, “This is what we believe.” He draws a clear line of what’s “good” and what’s “disgraceful.” It draws a massive amount of attention to a subject, and drives a wedge.  Think it's inappropriate for NFL players to kneel in protest:  Black: 7%  White non-Trump voter: 42%  White Trump voter: 95%    (HuffPost/YouGov) — Ariel Edwards-Levy (@aedwardslevy) September 28, 2017  A common Trump tactic is to take something nonpolitical, or not always obviously political (like the NFL) and use it to turn people against another. This isn’t to say there’s nothing worth debating or caring about in the NFL protests. Trump just amps up the temperature in a way that’s sure to pit people against one another.  As Yale professor Dan Kahan puts it, Donald Trump is a “toxic meme” generator.  Toxic memes are stories or ideas “that are predictively likely to trigger the sense that it is us against them,” Kahan explained earlier this year at a scientific conference. “The special danger of Donald Trump,” he said, “is that he can drag issues across this line. He’s the president of the United States. He’s going to get publicity for these kinds of statements, ones that he knows will end up dividing people.”  After Trump directed a massive amount of attention toward the NFL protests, and became so outspoken about it, look at what happened.  Nearly overnight, Trump supporters began to express strong negative feelings about the league. Yes, that’s conservative Americans expressing a dislike of football. Hard to imagine in a previous time.  All political leaders have the ability to polarize. But few have done what Trump has done: built a massive social media presence around drawing stark lines between the people who believe in “Make America Great Again” and the “losers” who don’t.  Trump makes it exceedingly clear to followers where their opinions on matters like the NFL anthem protests, Obamacare, and other weighty matters should lie. He’s a master at tying these issues to a proud American identity. If you identify as a proud patriot, and are told that patriots despise NFL owners who let players kneel during the anthem, you’re going to despise them too.  Prominent Republicans and conservatives have spoken out against Trump. It’s (probably) not enough to break Trump’s influence over Republicans.  Politicians are usually ideological. They usually conform nicely to what the party believes. There haven’t been too many tests (aside for the ones mentioned above) of the follow-the-leader theory in the real world. “It’s so rare for a leader of a party to come out and say, ‘We’re going to do this thing the base doesn’t like,’” Barber says.  It’s tempting to imagine a scenario in which Trump’s base leaves him — that if enough prominent Republican leaders and conservative thinkers make a clear, damning break with the president, they can lead Trump’s followers to a more ideologically pure pasture. In that scenario, Republicans hold on to their group identity while decrying Trump as a betrayer.  But let’s not hold our breath and wait for the moment when the Trump base leaves him en masse, though it would be a fascinating moment for political science if that happens. Still, 88 percent of Republicans approve of the job Trump is doing in the latest Gallup tracking poll.  For now, here’s what the political psychology suggests: A mass exodus ain’t going to happen. Recently, Broockman and his colleague Josh Kalla published a meta-analysis on 49 field experiments in which campaigns attempted to sway voters’ minds. They found evidence that voters’ opinions on issues can change, but not their opinions on candidates. That is to say: There’s scant scientific evidence to say that door-to-door political campaigns can dissuade voters from liking their chosen leader.  It’s also not certain that prominent Republicans could be the catalyst to lead a revolt. In their experiment, Barber and Pope found no evidence that “congressional leaders” could sway Republicans to adopt liberal views. The trick only worked with Trump’s name.  “Only the most vocal, loudest messages come through, and on that, it is hard to beat the president,” Lenz says.",3.65,10,"[4.5, 5.0, 0.5, 3.5, 5.0, 4.5, 3.0, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0]"

In an exclusive conversation with Co.Design’s Mark Wilson, Kinect creator Alex Kipman reflected on the unique device’s influence on the consumer technology sector. Seven years after its debut at E3 2010, our most talked-about new technologies represent the evolution of its fundamental ideas. Apple’s Siri, Google’s Alexa, and the Amazon Echo all branch from a device that learned about us, our homes, and our movements to provide a laundry list of features that are fast becoming industry standard, if not the hoped-for revolution in active gaming.  At the CMU Studio for Creative Inquiry, Golan Levin expressed dismay that the Kinect, a core part of so much art and research, has met its demise:  You know, we’re all at the whim of capital. And there’s no expectation that Microsoft should do something that doesn’t support their bottom line. But this is one of those times I’m sad to hear that a tool which is used for so many different applications, and is so ubiquitous, and has served crucially as a platform for so much creative experimentation, cultural progress, and secondary innovation, in so many different fields, isn’t supporting their core business. Someone has made the decision that there aren’t enough games being sold that use it and it’s a shame.  Levin observed that its discontinuation will have an “immense impact on computer research, robotics research and interactive media arts.”  Where the Kinect sought to add a new dimension to interactive entertainment, the PlayStation 4 doubled down on raw gaming power. The mixed signals around the Xbox One are, to a particular extent, responsible for the distrust and resultant negative buzz surrounding the Kinect’s intended implementation. Now, that same technology is being hailed in the iPhone X, after Apple’s acquisition of the PrimeSense tech that powered Microsoft’s project.  So the technology itself will live on, if not under this banner.

693,2099,10,16,2017,2017-10-16,Vox,How the Kochs are using Mike Pence to shape Trump's White House,"The power struggle between populist hardliners and moderate generals in the Trump White House is well documented. Vice President Mike Pence has largely stayed out of the drama, while quietly becoming one of the most powerful people in the Trump administration, according to a new profile of Pence from the New Yorker’s Jane Mayer.  Mayer’s piece shows that behind the scenes, the vice president has made a huge mark on President Trump’s policy agenda, while putting himself in a good position for his own presidential ambitions. Mayer writes that Pence’s influence has shaped White House policies far more than that of other important members of the administration, including Breitbart executive chair Steve Bannon or Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. In particular, Pence’s longstanding connection to libertarian megadonors Charles and David Koch — former political enemies of Trump — has helped shape the current White House.  Pence and Trump are two very different men. Pence is a devout evangelical who doesn’t dine alone with other women unless his wife is present. He made his name in conservative politics as a talk radio host and enacted hardline policies during his time as Indiana’s governor, mandating burials for fetuses and essentially allowing businesses to discriminate against gay people. Trump is a bombastic billionaire who famously bragged about groping women and publicly espoused pro-choice and pro-same-sex marriage views. Mayer’s piece includes moments where Trump mocked Pence’s socially conservative views and his tendency to pray in the White House.  We read the whole profile; these are the key takeaways about the influence of the former Indiana governor and cultural warrior.  Trump once joked about Pence wanting to “hang” gay people  Pence’s intense religious views have made him the butt of Trump’s jokes, according to Mayer’s piece. She details a moment when Trump made fun of Pence’s desire to get rid of the abortion protections in the landmark Roe v. Wade decision and said his vice president wanted to “hang” gay people:  During a meeting with a legal scholar, Trump belittled Pence’s determination to overturn Roe v. Wade. The legal scholar had said that, if the Supreme Court did so, many states would likely legalize abortion on their own. “You see?” Trump asked Pence. “You’ve wasted all this time and energy on it, and it’s not going to end abortion anyway.” When the conversation turned to gay rights, Trump motioned toward Pence and joked, “Don’t ask that guy — he wants to hang them all!”  Pence’s religion has also seeped into the White House, Mayer reports. Pence organizes a Bible study in the White House led by evangelical pastor Ralph Drollinger, who has written that women should “submit” to their husbands, described homosexuality as a “sin,” and called Catholicism a “false religion.” Administration members who attend include Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Mayer writes.  Pence is a Koch loyalist — and he’s not the only one in the White House  During the 2016 primaries, one of Trump’s main attacks on his Republican opponents was that they were “puppets” of the Koch brothers, accepting donations from the billionaires. A billionaire himself, Trump made a point of saying he didn’t need to accept donations from anyone else. He ultimately did, accepting more than $79 million in Super PAC money, but the Kochs made a point not to donate to his presidential campaign.  Pence has been closely affiliated with the Koch brothers since he was a Congress member from Indiana. He helped boost the “No Climate Tax” pledge by their political advocacy group, Americans for Prosperity, convincing other politicians to sign on. Many of Pence’s former political staffers have gone on to work for Koch Industries and their affiliated advocacy groups, and some have come back to work in the White House; a former Pence staffer named Marc Short now serves as the head of legislative affairs in the White House, and has close ties to the Koch brothers. Pence also helped boost Cabinet members including DeVos and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, both Koch favorites.  Democrats and Steve Bannon alike have openly complained about the Kochs’ influence on Pence. The vice president is, as the saying goes, only a heartbeat away from the presidency. Contemplating the possibility of Pence as president, Bannon told Mayer, “I’m concerned he’d be a president that the Kochs would own.”  Pence pushed out those who challenged him  In becoming vice president and then becoming head of the Trump transition team, Pence twice bested New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, with whom he was reportedly in a dead heat for the VP job. After the election, Pence also tossed months of work and research Christie’s team did on Cabinet staffing and started over from scratch.  Pence also sidestepped Christie on the decision to hire former National Security Agency director Mike Flynn, who is currently a main player in multiple investigations into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. Christie reportedly did not consider Flynn trustworthy, but after he left the transition team, Pence did not object to Flynn coming on, with little vetting. As the Russia investigations continue, this could have resounding consequences for the Trump White House, especially as Pence himself got caught up in the fallout, giving misleading statements as to what he knew about Flynn and the firing of FBI Director James Comey.  As Mayer reports:  Several law professors have argued that the Vice-President could be vulnerable to charges of obstructing justice, or “misprision of a felony,” for participating in a meeting about shutting down the federal investigation and then providing a false cover story to the public. Pence has hired an outside lawyer, Richard Cullen, and has further strengthened his political armor by hiring Nick Ayers as his chief of staff. Laurence Tribe, a law professor at Harvard, tweeted, “The VP appears to me to be in what we lawyers have been known to call deep doo-doo.”  Mayer’s whole piece in this week’s issue of the New Yorker is worth reading in full.",3.2916666666666665,12,"[1.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 0.5, 3.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 1.0, 0.5, 4.5]"

There is a shortage of properties for sale, causing the prices to steadily rise at more than double the pace of average hourly earnings. Buyers are also relying on historically low mortgage rates to ease the affordability pressures. Cheaper borrowing costs have kept buyer demand strong despite the price increases.  Prices are likely to keep rising, said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices.  ""Given current economic conditions and the tight housing market, an immediate reversal in home price trends appears unlikely,"" Blitzer said.  The largest price gain over the past year occurred in the Seattle metro area with a 13.4 percent increase year-over-year. Portland, Oregon and Dallas recorded sizable price growth.  But other metro areas are seeing a more tempered increase in home values.  Prices rose less than 4 percent in the more expensive New York City and Washington, DC markets. They increased just 2.9 percent in Cleveland and 3.2 percent in Chicago.  The National Association of Realtors said last week that the number of existing homes listed for sale has plummeted 9 percent over the past 12 months to 1.92 million. Because buyers are competing for fewer homes, the Realtor's median sales price has surged 6.2 percent to $258,300.  Supporting demand have been relatively low mortgage rates.  The average 30-year fixed rate mortgage was 3.86 percent last week, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac. Average rates have declined in recent months, in line with Treasury bond yields, as uncertainty has surrounded President Donald Trump's tax and infrastructure policies and their ability to stimulate faster economic growth.",3.5,1,[3.5]

How many of those same women were simultaneously begging Harvey Weinstein, who was apparently a well known sexual predator, for a job?  Well, today Harvey got some very bad news…  Harvey Weinstein, the disgraced co-founder and CEO of The Weinstein Company, has been fired effective immediately, his board of directors said on Sunday.  The statement said:  “In light of new information about misconduct by Harvey Weinstein that has emerged in the past few days, the directors of The Weinstein Company – Robert Weinstein, Lance Maerov, Richard Koenigsberg and Tarak Ben Ammar – have determined, and have informed Harvey Weinstein, that his employment with The Weinstein Company is terminated, effective immediately.”  The company has been under intense pressure since The New York Times broke an investigative story on Thursday detailing three decades of sexual misconduct, including propositioning actresses and harassing female employees. More ugly stories continued to dribble out over the weekend, including a vulgar report by a news anchor that Weinstein masturbated in front of her and other stories of inappropriate propositions.  Internally Weinstein continued to fight for his survival, insiders have told TheWrap. His advisors – including his brother Bob – told him that he needed to take the allegations seriously and not merely pay lip service. They wanted him to leave for six months and get treatment for sex addiction or whatever his behavior may be called.  Weinstein told TheWrap in an interview on Thursday that he was sincere in his apology and intention to make amends. But reports continued to leak out of the company internally that the CEO was determined to dictate the terms of his leave of absence and treatment.  Harvey and Bob Weinstein co-founded the indie film company Miramax in 1979 and grew it into a powerhouse brand that made art-house films mainstream — and reshaped the Academy Awards race with aggressive marketing and buzz.  The company was bought by Disney in 1993, where the brothers continued to run the company — and dominate the Oscar race — until they left in 2005 to launch the new privately held The Weinstein Company. The brothers have a 44 percent stake in the firm, according to the Times.

52,283,7,5,2017,2017-07-05,Vox,Every new Volvo will be a hybrid or electric car after 2019,"Volvo is about to end development of new cars with conventional gasoline engines, the company announced on Wednesday. Beginning in 2019, all new Volvo models will be hybrids or battery-powered electric vehicles.  The company will continue selling the gasoline-powered car models it already has on the market. But all of Volvo’s new cars will have electric motors — including five fully electric vehicles Volvo expects to introduce between 2019 and 2021.  “This announcement marks the end of the solely combustion engine-powered car,” said Volvo CEO Håkan Samuelsson in a company press release. The company hopes that a decisive shift toward battery-powered vehicles will allow it to meet its goal of producing a cumulative total of a million electrified vehicles by 2025.  This is a particularly bold move because right now, hybrid and battery-powered electric cars account for a tiny fraction of the global car market. Hybrids accounted for about 2 percent of the US car market in 2016, for example. But experts expect explosive growth in these numbers over the next decade.  Until recently, high battery costs have forced carmakers to choose between making unaffordable electric cars — like Tesla’s $69,500 Model S — or skimp on battery capacity and make cars whose range and power compare unfavorably to cars with conventional gasoline-powered engines.  But battery costs are plunging. Prices fell by almost 80 percent between 2010 and 2016. And with manufacturers in China and elsewhere preparing to dramatically boost battery production, we can expect economies of scale to push prices down even more over the next few years.  As a result, the economics of electric-powered vehicles have gotten a lot more favorable. Batteries have gotten cheap enough that all-electric cars like the Chevy Bolt and the new Tesla Model 3 can boast more than 200 miles of range and sell for around $35,000. And if battery prices continue falling, we’ll eventually reach a point where electric cars — with their relatively simple electric motors and low-cost electric power — actually cost less to own than a conventional car with its more complex internal combustion engine. One 2016 study projected that we could reach this point as early as 2022.  At that point, the companies with the best electric-powered cars will have a big advantage over companies that are still mostly selling cars with internal combustion engines. Electric cars will be greener, more convenient, and less expensive to own. The stock market is so bullish about this strategy that it has valued Tesla on par with conventional car companies like GM and Ford that sold about 100 times as many cars in 2016.  Volvo wants to catch the same wave Tesla is riding. Tesla has set a goal to produce 500,000 electric cars per year in 2018 and a million in 2020. Volvo’s goal is much less ambitious: the company hopes to produce a total of 1 million cars over the next eight years. Volvo set this goal last year, and it now looks relatively conservative in light of Volvo’s all-electric push. The company sold 534,000 vehicles in 2016, so if it shifts most of its sales to electric vehicles in the early 2020s it will sell a lot more than a million electric cars by 2025.  In any event, ending development of conventional cars with internal combustion engines will put Volvo on a solid footing if electricity proves to be the future of the auto industry.",4.0,1,[4.0]

Chief Executive Officer Masayoshi Son, left, speaks during a SoftBank World presentation at a hotel in Tokyo. Japanese internet and solar company SoftBank Group Corp. is raising its stake in Sprint Corp. after merger talks with T-Mobile collapsed, signaling its commitment to a turnaround at the U.S. wireless carrier. SoftBank reported Monday, Nov. 6, 2017, that July-September net profit tumbled to 113 billion yen ($991 million) from 528 billion yen a year ago. (AP Photo/Shizuo Kambayashi, File)  TOKYO (AP) — Japanese internet and solar company SoftBank Group Corp. is raising its stake in Sprint Corp. after merger talks with T-Mobile collapsed, signaling its commitment to a turnaround at the U.S. wireless carrier.  Tokyo-based SoftBank reported Monday that July-September net profit tumbled to 113 billion yen ($991 million) from 528 billion yen a year ago.  Quarterly sales rose nearly 4 percent to 2.23 trillion yen ($19.5 billion) on improved results at Sprint, as well as revenue from Arm, a British chips company SoftBank acquired last year.  Helping bring profit lower was the absence of last year’s foreign-exchange gains, as well as derivative losses that came from its sale of part of its stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.  T-Mobile and Sprint are the third- and fourth-largest wireless carriers, respectively, in the U.S., but they are significantly smaller than AT&T and Verizon, which effectively have a duopoly over the U.S. wireless service.  Wireless carriers Sprint and T-Mobile called off a potential merger Saturday, saying the companies couldn’t come to an agreement that would benefit customers and shareholders.  The two companies have been dancing around a possible merger for years, and were again in the news in recent weeks with talks of them coming together after all. But in a joint statement Saturday, Sprint and T-Mobile said the negotiations were off for the foreseeable future.  Sprint has debt and has been losing money, but its results had been improving gradually, partly because of additional investments from SoftBank, which also sells the Pepper humanoid.  But both analysts and SoftBank had said they believed Sprint needs a deal, rather than trying to compete on its own.  But Washington regulators have frowned on a possible merger. D.C. spiked AT&T’s offer to buy T-Mobile in 2011, and signaled in 2014 they would have been against Sprint doing the same thing. But with the new Trump administration, it was thought regulators might be more relaxed about a merger.  SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son told reporters that the talks fell apart because T-Mobile did not want to be equal partners in management. But he insisted Sprint will prove a gold mine because of the move to IoT, where SoftBank’s investment in Arm will pay off, especially in the U.S.  “We are entering an era where billions of new connected devices and sensors will come online throughout the United States,” he said. “Sprint is a critical part of our plan to ensure that we can deliver our vision to American consumers and we are very confident in its future.”  Son said he felt “absolutely great” after the merger talks ended because worries over indecisiveness were gone.  “It was an important decision,” he said. “But the day will come when having Sprint will pay off.”  Although Arm’s sales grew from the previous year, its losses grew as well because of costs for hiring engineers.  Son, credited as a visionary and seen in the company of high-profile people like Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates and President Donald Trump, has been aggressive in investing in artificial intelligence, the internet of things and renewable energy.  Son has set up a $100 billion SoftBank Vision Fund specially for the technology sector with money from Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and other investors.  SoftBank’s Japanese mobile business continued to do well in the last quarter, increasing smartphone subscribers, according to the company. SoftBank was the first carrier in Japan to offer Apple’s iPhone.  It also owns the SoftBank Hawks baseball club, which recently won the Japan Series, this nation’s equivalent of the World Series.  ___  Yuri Kageyama can be reached at twitter.com/yurikageyama  Her work can be found at https://www.apnews.com/search/yuri%20kageyama",3.21875,16,"[4.0, 3.5, 0.5, 2.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 0.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 2.5, 4.0, 4.5]"

So why has the economic expansion since the recession been so tame, with sluggish productivity and, at least until recently, anemic wage growth?

(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee)  Rising sea levels and fierce storms have failed to stop relentless population growth along U.S. coasts in recent years, a new Associated Press analysis shows. The latest punishing hurricanes scored bull’s-eyes on two of the country’s fastest growing regions: coastal Texas around Houston and resort areas of southwest Florida.  Nothing seems to curb America’s appetite for life near the sea, especially in the warmer climates of the South. Coastal development destroys natural barriers such as islands and wetlands, promotes erosion and flooding, and positions more buildings and people in the path of future destruction, according to researchers and policy advisers who study hurricanes.  “History gives us a lesson, but we don’t always learn from it,” said Graham Tobin, a disaster researcher at the University of South Florida in Tampa. That city took a glancing hit from Hurricane Irma — one of the most intense U.S. hurricanes in years — but suffered less flooding and damage than some other parts of the state.  In 2005, coastal communities took heed of more than 1,800 deaths and $108 billion in damages from Hurricane Katrina, one of the worst disasters in U.S. history. Images of New Orleans under water elicited solemn resolutions that such a thing should never happen again — until Superstorm Sandy inundated lower Manhattan in 2012. Last year, Hurricane Matthew spread more deaths, flooding and blackouts across Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. From 2010-2016, major hurricanes and tropical storms are blamed for more than 280 deaths and $100 billion in damages, according to data from the federal National Centers for Environmental Information.  Harvey, another historically big hurricane, flooded sections of Houston in recent weeks. Four counties around Houston, where growth has been buoyed by the oil business, took the full force of the storm. The population of those counties expanded by 12 percent from 2010 to 2016, to a total of 5.3 million people, the AP analysis shows.  During the same years, two of Florida’s fastest-growing coastline counties — retirement-friendly Lee and Manatee, both south of Tampa — welcomed 16 percent more people. That area took a second direct hit from Irma after it made first landfall in the Florida Keys, where damage was far more devastating.  Overall growth of 10 percent in Texas Gulf counties and 9 percent along Florida’s coasts during the same period was surpassed only by South Carolina. Its seaside population, led by the Myrtle Beach area of Horry County, ballooned by more than 13 percent.  Nationally, coastline counties grew an average of 5.6 percent since 2010, while inland counties gained just 4 percent. This recent trend tracks with decades of development along U.S. coasts. Between 1960 and 2008, the national coastline population rose by 84 percent, compared with 64 percent inland, according to the Census Bureau.  Cindy Gerstner, a retiree from the inland mountains of upstate New York, moved to a new home in January in Dunedin, Florida, west of Tampa. The ranch house sits on a flood plain three blocks from a sound off the Gulf of Mexico. She was told it hadn’t flooded in 20 years — and she wasn’t worried anyway.  “I never gave it a thought,” she said during a visit back to New York as Irma raked Florida. “I always wanted to live down there. I always thought people who lived in California on earthquake faults were foolish.”  Her enthusiasm for her new home was undiminished by Irma, which broke her fence and knocked out power but left her house dry.  In Horry County, where 19 percent growth has led all of South Carolina coastline counties, Irma caused only minor coastal flooding. The county’s low property taxes are made possible by rapid development and tourism fees, allowing retirees from the North and Midwest to live more cheaply. Ironically, punishing hurricanes farther south in recent years has pushed some Northerners known locally as “half-backers” to return halfway home from Florida and to resettle in coastal South Carolina.  Add the area’s moderate weather, appealing golf courses, and long white strands — the county is home to Myrtle Beach — and maybe no one can slow development there. “I don’t see how you do it,” said Johnny Vaught, vice chairman of the county council. “The only thing you can do is modulate it, so developments are well designed.”  Strong building codes with elevation and drainage requirements, careful emergency preparations, and a good network of roads for evacuation help make the area more resilient to big storms, said the council chairman, Mark Lazarus. Such measures give people “a sense of comfort,” said Laura Crowther, CEO of the local Coastal Carolina Association of Realtors.  Risk researchers say more is needed. “We’re getting better at emergency response,” said Tobin at the University of South Florida. “We’re not so good at long-term control of urban development in hazardous areas.”  The Federal Emergency Management Agency helps recovery efforts with community relief and flood insurance payments. The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It provides community grants for projects aimed at avoiding future losses. Some projects elevate properties, build flood barriers, or strengthen roofs and windows against high winds. Others purchase properties subject to repeated damage and allow owners to move.  But coastline communities face more storm threats in the future.  Global warming from human-generated greenhouse gases is melting polar ice and elevating sea levels at an increasing pace, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That amplifies storm surges and other flooding. Also, some climate models used by scientists predict stronger, more frequent hurricanes as another effect of global warming in coming decades.  “There will be some real challenges for coastal towns,” predicted Jamie Kruse, director of the Center for Natural Hazards Research at East Carolina University in Greenville, North Carolina. “We’ll see some of these homes that are part of their tax base becoming unlivable.”  Hazard researchers said they see nothing in the near term to reverse the trend toward bigger storm losses. As a stopgap, communities should cease building new high-rises on the oceanfront, said Robert Young, director of the Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines at Western Carolina University in Cullowhee, North Carolina.  He said big changes probably will not happen unless multiple giant storms overwhelm federal and state budgets.  “The reason why this development still continues is that people are making money doing it,” he said. “Communities are still increasing their tax base — and that’s what politicians like.”  ___  Donn reported from Plymouth, Massachusetts.  ___  Online:  National Centers for Environmental Information: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/  Center for Natural Hazards Research: http://www.ecu.edu/cs-cas/hazards/  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: http://www.noaa.gov/  Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines: https://psds.wcu.edu/  ___  HURRICANE NEWSLETTER - Get the best of the AP’s all-formats reporting on Irma and Harvey in your inbox: http://apne.ws/ahYQGtb",3.75,4,"[5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 2.5]"

(John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation via AP)  CHICAGO (AP) — A director who has taken opera from the concert hall to the streets of Los Angeles and an organizer who helped put a human face on the plight of young undocumented immigrants are among this year’s MacArthur fellows and recipients of the so-called genius grants.  The Chicago-based John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation on Wednesday announced the 24 fellows, who each receive $625,000 over five years to spend any way they choose. The recipients work in a variety of fields, from computer science to theater, immunology and photography.  The foundation has awarded the fellowships annually since 1981 to people who show “exceptional creativity in their work and the prospect for still more in the future.” Previous winners include “Hamilton” playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda and author-journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates.  There is no application process. Instead, an anonymous pool of nominators brings potential fellows to the foundation’s attention. Those selected learn they’ve been chosen shortly before the awards are announced.  For opera director and producer Yuval Sharon, the news that he had been selected was “an enormous shock and honor.” When the foundation called, he assumed they were seeking a referral for someone else who’d been nominated.  “I’m totally amazed,” said Sharon, 37, the founder and artistic director of The Industry, a Los Angeles-based production company that produces operas in nontraditional spaces and formats.  A 2015 production transported audience members and performers to various locations in Los Angeles via limousines, with singers and musicians performing along the way and at each stop.  His next work, an adaptation of the radio program “War of the Worlds” will utilize decommissioned World War II sirens to broadcast the performance occurring inside the theater onto the streets. The sounds of performers stationed outdoors — and likely the traffic and other street noise — will then be transmitted back into the concert hall.  Sharon said he comes across many people who don’t think opera is for them, but he hopes hearing about these kinds of “audacious experiments” will peak their interest.  Another fellow, Cristina Jiménez Moreta, is co-founder and executive director of United We Dream, a national network of groups led by immigrant youth.  Moreta, 33, and her parents came to the U.S. illegally from Ecuador when she was a child. At 19, she revealed her undocumented status publicly. It was a move that put her and her family at risk of deportation, but also placed her at the forefront of a movement to change the way immigrants are perceived.  She was instrumental in pressing for the 2012 adoption of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the now-endangered executive order that allowed thousands of undocumented young people to live without fear of deportation.  Moreta said the fellowship is recognition of the resilience shown by her parents and other immigrants who “had the courage to stand up and say ‘we are here, this is our home and we are fighting.’”  The first people she told were her parents, who were fearful when she started organizing but now join her in marches and to pass petitions.  “They’re very proud,” she said.  Also selected was Dawoud Bey, a photographer and educator from Chicago whose portraits often feature people from marginalized communities. For “The Birmingham Project,” he commemorated the 1963 bombing at a church in Birmingham, Alabama, that killed six children, with a series of portraits of Birmingham residents who were the age of each of the children killed and the age they would be if they had lived.  Others announced Wednesday were writer and cultural critic Viet Thanh Nguyen — whose novel, “The Sympathizer,” about a communist double agent, won the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for fiction — and Derek Peterson, a historian of East Africa and professor at the University of Michigan.  ___  Online: www.macfound.org  ___  This story has been updated to correct the spelling of the Chicago photographer’s name to Dawoud Bey, not Deyoud Bey.",5.0,1,[5.0]

Thousands are gathering at simultaneous rallies in Madrid and Barcelona in a call for dialogue amid a political crisis caused by Catalonia's secession push. (AP Photo/Emilio Morenatti)  BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Thousands rallied in Madrid and Barcelona on Saturday in a last-ditch call for Spanish and Catalan leaders to stave off a national crisis amid Catalonia’s threat to secede.  The rallies in the Spanish capital and the Catalan city were held with the slogan “Shall We Talk?” in an effort to push lawmakers in both cities to end months of silence and start negotiating. Attendees respected the organizers’ call to not bring the Spanish or Catalan flag.  Catalonia’s regional president Carles Puigdemont has vowed to make good on the results of last Sunday’s disputed referendum on secession won by the Yes side. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy warned that the vote was illegal and has promised that Catalonia is going nowhere.  Protestors packed Barcelona’s Sant Jaume Square where the Catalan government has its presidential palace, shouting “We want to talk!” and holding signs saying “More Negotiation, Less Testosterone!” and “Talk or Resign!”  “We have to find a new way forward,” said Miquel Iceta, the leader of Spain’s Socialist party in Catalonia. “It’s the moment to listen to the people who are asking for the problem to be solved through an agreement, and without precipitated and unilateral decisions.”  The gathering around Madrid’s Cibeles fountain boasted a huge banner demanding that leaders start talking. Some people chanted “Less hate, and more understanding!”  In a separate rally in Madrid’s Colon Square, thousands clamored for the unity of Spain and against any attempt by the northeastern region to break away. The crowd bristled with Spanish flags. Pro-union forces will try to generate momentum on Sunday in a protest in Barcelona.  Other protests asking for dialogue were held in cities including Valencia, Bilbao, Pamplona and Sanitago de Compostela, news agency Europa Press reported.  The calls for dialogue and unity come after a traumatic week, with riot police storming several polling stations in an unsuccessful attempt to impede the referendum. Instead, hundreds of voters were left in need of medical attention.  Even though 2.2 million Catalan voted — with 90 percent backing independence— the referendum polled less than half of the region’s electorate. Puigdemont declared he would seek a declaration of independence in the regional parliament anyway.  The bloodied vote was followed by a strike on Tuesday across Catalonia to protest the police violence. Then came the stern message from Spain’s King Felipe VI that the Catalan government and parliament were breaking the law.  Puigdemont and his separatist supporters were struck a blow when Catalonia’s top two banks, CaixaBank and Banco Sabadell, as well as energy giant Gas Natural announced they were relocating their headquarters from Catalonia to other parts of Spain.  Other companies are considering such a move to ensure that the region’s possible secession wouldn’t knock them out of the European Union and its lucrative common market.  Spain’s Minister of Public Works Inigo de la Serna said on Saturday that “the companies will keep leaving and it’s exclusively the fault of the members of the regional government.”  The warnings by the business sector have coincided with the first calls from within Puigdemont’s government to hold off on a declaration of independence.  Santi Vila, Catalonia’s regional chief for business, told Cadena SER Radio late Friday that he’s pushing for “a new opportunity for dialogue” with Spanish authorities.  “We have to give it one more chance, maybe the last chance, and perhaps the only way that can happen is to start with a cease-fire,” Vila said.  Vila said he would like to see Spanish authorities return powers to the region which they have assumed in recent weeks, including control of a large part of its finances.  It is unclear how widespread Vila’s moderate position is inside the Catalan government, which is being pressured by separatist grassroots groups and the far-left party CUP to declare independence soon.  Separatist lawmakers had planned to discuss a secession plan on Monday, but that session in the regional parliament was suspended by the Constitutional Court.  The focus has shifted to Tuesday, when Puigdemont is set to address the regional parliament “to report on the current political situation.”  The most recent polls taken before the referendum showed that the region’s 7.5 million residents were roughly split on the issue.",3.4454545454545453,55,"[4.0, 1.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 3.0, 2.0, 5.0, 4.0, 2.5, 4.0, 5.0, 4.5, 2.0, 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 4.5, 5.0, 3.0, 3.5, 1.5, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 2.5, 2.0, 3.5, 3.5, 2.5, 4.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 2.0, 1.5, 3.5, 4.5, 2.5, 2.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 1.5, 3.5, 3.0, 4.5, 5.0, 4.5, 1.5]"
935,2436,10,24,2017,2017-10-24,Fox News,Sessions: All bets are off in hunt for MS-13 street gang,"U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Monday promised an all-out assault on the brutal MS-13 street gang “just like we took Al Capone off the streets.”  Sessions said the gang’s members are suspected in a series of killings in New York City's suburbs and the U.S. “will use whatever laws we have” to get them off the street.  The new designation directs prosecutors to pursue all legal avenues, including racketeering, gun and tax laws, to target the gang, said Sessions, a Republican former U.S. senator from Alabama.  Sessions designated the gang with Central American ties as a ""priority"" for the Department of Justice's Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces, which has historically focused on drug trafficking and money laundering. MS-13, or La Mara Salvatrucha, is generally known for extortion and violence rather than distributing and selling narcotics.  ""They leave misery, devastation and death in their wake. They threaten entire governments. They must be and will be stopped,"" the attorney general said, while in Philadelphia.  The gang has become a prime target of President Trump's administration amid its broader crackdown on immigration.  Members of the gang are suspected of committing several high-profile killings in New York, Maryland and Virginia. The gang's violence drew the Republican president's attention after two teenage girls was beaten and hacked to death in a suspected gang attack on Long Island.  The girls were among 22 people believed to have been killed by the gang on Long Island since the start of 2016. Most of the people arrested in those killings were in the U.S. illegally, law enforcement officials have said.  After Trump took office, he directed federal law enforcement officials to focus resources on combating transnational gangs, including MS-13. But the new designation will allow officials to target MS-13 with a ""renewed vigor and a sharpened focus,"" said Sessions, who flew to El Salvador in July, in part to learn more about how the gang's activities there affect crime in the U.S.  MS-13 originated in Los Angeles in the 1980s, then entrenched itself in Central America when its leaders were deported.  Making a street gang like MS-13 a priority marks a shift for the drug enforcement task force, said James Trusty, who headed the Department of Justice's organized crime and gang section before he left in January.  Some MS-13 cases have drug connections, but ""you'd be hard-pressed to come up with evidence that MS-13 is part of a cartel,"" he said. ""The most common aspect of MS-13 prosecutions has been murder and witness intimidation or retaliation, not drug trafficking.""

801,2230,10,19,2017,2017-10-19,Fox News,Shares of United Airlines tumble after 3Q financial report,"Shares of United Airlines dropped more than 12 percent on Thursday — their biggest one-day percentage decline in eight years — after a contentious conference call that caused analysts to question whether United executives are making progress on their turnaround plan.  Analysts speculated whether a management shakeup could be coming.  United had already signaled that weak pricing will continue for the rest of this year. On the call, several analysts pressed management for evidence that the company is doing enough to raise revenue and control costs.  CEO Oscar Munoz appealed for patience. He said United ""dug ourselves in a hole"" compared to competitors, and that his management team is working on a plan for long-term success.  ""It's a difficult period for us as we work through all this information,"" Munoz said. ""The team has only been in place really for a year and we're just getting our mojo working ... I just need a little more time.""  Munoz was named CEO in September 2015. He cemented his executive lineup by hiring former American Airlines president Scott Kirby for the same job at United in August 2016.  United executives claimed Thursday that measures they spelled out at an investor day last year to raise revenue and cut spending were going well, but they declined to give specifics or back away from expansion plans.  Barclays analyst Brandon Oglenski was especially pointed in his criticism, telling Munoz that the CEO should know that when a company makes public statements about financial targets, investors will want to measure it against those numbers. He said United's earnings, margins and stock price were doing worse in 2017 than those of key rivals.  Shares of United Continental Holdings Inc. tumbled $8.21, or 12.1 percent, to close at $59.78. It was the biggest one-day drop ever in price, and the biggest percentage decline since October 2009. The shares have dropped 18 percent this year, while shares of American, Delta and Southwest airlines have gained between 6 and 18 percent.  Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi said Thursday's sell-off reflected ""an erosion in confidence of management."" He said the top question he heard from investors was whether this could be ""a catalyst for management change.""  ""Clearly, patience with executing the turnaround at United is wearing thin with investors,"" DeNardi wrote in a note to clients.  Cowen and Co. analyst Helane Becker said there had been ""rumblings"" from investors about another shakeup at United before the call, but afterward ""they aren't rumblings, but full-fledged screams.""  The prickly call came a day after United reported that third-quarter profit fell by one-third to $637 million as hurricanes led to 8,300 canceled flights and $210 million in lost revenue. A key measure of pricing power fell 3.7 percent, and the Chicago-based airline forecast it will drop by 1 percent to 3 percent in the fourth quarter.  Analysts said the fourth-quarter forecast wasn't so bad, but raised doubts about recent business initiatives.  ""People are beginning to wonder, is the strategy working?"" Stephens Inc. analyst Jack Atkins said in an interview. ""When will we see that materialize in the financials?""  United is on pace to increase domestic passenger-carrying capacity by more than 4 percent this year. Atkins said that is too fast and undermines pricing power, and that United is simultaneously seeing a ""really troubling"" increase in costs.  ___  David Koenig can be reached at http://twitter.com/airlinewriter",3.2533333333333334,150,"[4.0, 2.5, 3.0, 2.5, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 4.5, 2.5, 4.5, 3.5, 1.0, 5.0, 1.5, 3.5, 0.5, 5.0, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 2.5, 5.0, 2.0, 1.5, 4.5, 4.0, 2.5, 2.5, 3.5, 2.5, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 5.0, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 1.0, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 5.0, 3.0, 4.0, 4.5, 3.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.5, 2.5, 4.5, 3.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 3.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 2.5, 2.5, 4.5, 4.5, 2.5, 1.5, 0.5, 3.5, 3.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.5, 3.0, 3.5, 3.0, 0.5, 2.5, 5.0, 3.0, 4.0, 2.5, 4.0, 2.5, 5.0, 4.5, 3.0, 4.0, 2.0, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 1.0, 3.0, 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 3.0, 2.5, 4.0, 2.0, 4.0, 3.5, 1.5, 3.5, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.5, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 3.0, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.0, 1.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.0, 3.5, 2.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.0, 4.5, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 4.0, 4.0, 3.0, 3.0, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5]"
156,943,9,13,2017,2017-09-13,Fox News,Karl Rove: The 30 Republicans holding up tax reform,"No matter how persuasive President Trump is, it’s unlikely he can round up enough Democrats to get 60 votes in the Senate for tax reform. That means Republicans will need to use the Senate’s reconciliation process, which avoids the filibuster, to pass their plan with 51 votes. But first the House and Senate must pass a budget resolution—and soon.  A budget resolution sets spending levels and authorizes congressional committees to prepare bills fulfilling the blueprint. With the reconciliation plan in mind, this year’s resolution would set the size of the tax reform and then instruct the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee to flesh out the provisions.  Gaining agreement on a budget resolution is always tough. No more than a handful of lawmakers from the opposition party ever vote for the majority’s resolution. It helps that Republicans control both the House and Senate, but the GOP must still resolve its internal philosophical disagreements.  House Republicans tend to insist on resolutions that balance the budget within 10 years. This means resolutions that pledge to slow substantially the growth of entitlement spending. Such promises are rarely fulfilled. But putting them in the budget blueprint fuels Democratic ads claiming Republicans will throw grandma off the cliff and deprive poor children of free school lunches. Knowing this, Senate Republicans tend to want resolutions that reach balance after 10 years. Another GOP tension is between defense hawks, who want increased military spending, and deficit hawks, who want all spending restrained or cut.

278,1610,10,4,2017,2017-10-04,Associated Press News,Tillerson denies he weighed resigning or called boss ‘moron’,"Secretary of State Rex Tillerson turns away from a podium, to return to his office, after making a statement at the State Department in Washington, Wednesday, Oct. 4, 2017. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Rex Tillerson declared Wednesday he never considered resigning as President Donald Trump’s top diplomat, disputing what he called “erroneous” reports that he wanted to step down earlier this year. After pointedly refusing to answer if he called the president a “moron,” Tillerson had a spokeswoman deny he used such language.  Thrust into the spotlight under uncomfortable circumstances, the normally camera-shy Tillerson sought to rebut a widely disseminated NBC News story that claimed Vice President Mike Pence had to talk the former oil man out of resigning over the summer, and that Tillerson had questioned Trump’s intelligence. The explosive claims followed several instances in which Trump and Tillerson’s policy pronouncements have appeared to clash.  “There has never been a consideration in my mind to leave,” Tillerson told reporters in an unusually personal address from the State Department’s staid 7th-floor Treaty Room outside of his office.  From Las Vegas, where he traveled to meet with medical personnel and others affected by the mass shooting there, Trump told reporters he has “total confidence” in Tillerson. Earlier, Trump denounced the report as “fake news” on Twitter.  Rex Tillerson says he has never considered leaving his post as secretary of state. (Oct. 4)  Trump’s administration already had seen an unprecedented wave of departures, including a chief of staff, a national security adviser and a Cabinet secretary. However, his core national security team — Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and his second national security adviser, H.R. McMaster — has been viewed by Republicans and even many Democrats as a pillar of stability in an otherwise chaotic government.  Even so, Trump has at times appeared to undercut Tillerson’s message on some of America’s most sensitive national security challenges, including Iran and North Korea. Tillerson also has publicly complained about the White House blocking him from making key appointments.  Sen. Bob Corker, the Foreign Relations Committee chairman, said Tillerson hasn’t been sufficiently supported and “is in an incredibly frustrating place.” The Republican senator, who has criticized Trump’s leadership, offered a stark assessment: Tillerson, Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly are “those people that help separate our country from chaos.”  While praising Trump’s foreign policy on Wednesday, Tillerson raised eyebrows by pointedly declining to deny he had called the president a “moron” after a contentious meeting at the Pentagon in July.  “I’m not going to deal with petty stuff like that,” the former Exxon Mobil CEO said. “I mean, this is what I don’t understand about Washington. Again, I’m not from this place, but the places I come from, we don’t deal with that kind of petty nonsense.”  “Let me tell you what I’ve learned about this president, whom I did not know before taking this office,” Tillerson said. “He loves his country. He puts Americans and America first. He’s smart. He demands results wherever he goes, and he holds those around him accountable for whether they’ve done the job he’s asked them to do.”  Later, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert flatly denied that Tillerson called Trump a moron. She said Tillerson hasn’t said sorry to Trump, as no apology was needed.  Pence backed up Tillerson’s account by saying the two men never discussed the “prospect of the secretary’s resignation from the administration.”  “Any reporting to the contrary is categorically false,” Pence’s statement said.  NBC said Tillerson had been on the verge of resigning this summer amid mounting policy disputes with the White House. It said the tensions came to a head around the time Trump gave a politicized speech in July to the Boy Scouts of America, an organization Tillerson once led. The network claimed Pence and Mattis convinced Tillerson to stay.  A person familiar with the conversation also disputed that the vice president sought to coax the secretary of state into not quitting. The discussion instead focused on easing tensions between Tillerson and the White House and finding a way for him to operate better within the Cabinet, said the individual who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly on the private discussion and demanded anonymity.  Trump himself pounced on the NBC report, before and after Tillerson offered his side of the story.  “The @NBCNews story has just been totally refuted by Sec. Tillerson and @VP Pence. It is #FakeNews. They should issue an apology to AMERICA!” Trump tweeted.  NBC stood by its reporting.  Tillerson sought to broach the story in the typically somber and methodical manner he has approached being secretary of state. He framed his response as a defense of Trump’s entire “America First” foreign policy, and his own place within that strategy. He also noted the diplomatic successes of Nikki Haley, Trump’s U.N. ambassador, with whom he has been privately clashing for several months.  “President Trump’s foreign policy goals break the mold of what people traditionally think of what is achievable,” Tillerson said.  Tillerson appeared most frustrated that talk of his resignation is persisting despite previous denials.  “I have answered that question repeatedly. For some reason, it continues to be misreported,” he said.  ___  Associated Press writers Ken Thomas, Matthew Pennington, Jill Colvin and Richard Lardner contributed.",5.0,1,[5.0]
159,956,6,1,2017,2017-06-01,Vox,"After Trump quit the Paris climate agreement, Elon Musk is quitting Trump’s advisory groups","Elon Musk is severing ties with the Trump administration over Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate deal, he announced in a Thursday afternoon tweet.  Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2017  Musk was one of several Silicon Valley leaders who urged Donald Trump to remain in the agreement. Apple CEO Tim Cook called the president on Tuesday to urge him to keep the US in the climate deal.  Musk’s voice matters here because he is one of the few Silicon Valley CEOs who has maintained close ties to the president. After the 2016 election, he agreed to serve on Trump’s Strategic and Policy Forum, a group of prominent CEOs who advise the president on economic policy issues. He also agreed to participate in Trump’s Manufacturing Jobs Initiative to promote manufacturing employment in the United States.  Musk faced pressure to quit these groups after Trump announced his controversial immigration order, but Musk insisted he could do more good from the inside.  “Advisory councils simply provide advice and attending does not mean that I agree with actions by the administration,” Musk wrote in February. “My goals are to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy and to help make humanity a multi-planet civilization. Engaging on critical issues will on balance serve the greater good.”  But Musk cares a lot about climate change — that’s why he’s building a company that makes electric cars and solar panels, after all. And so announced on Wednesday that the Paris agreement represented a red line for him.  Will have no choice but to depart councils in that case — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 31, 2017  The stakes are high for Musk because his other company, SpaceX, counts NASA as its top customer. Some reports suggest SpaceX gets the majority of its revenue from NASA. While NASA’s contracting decisions are supposed to be apolitical, Musk can’t be sure that burning bridges with the Trump administration won’t hurt SpaceX’s chances of getting government contracts in the future.  Under the Paris framework, nations around the world have established targets for reducing their carbon emissions. These commitments are not legally binding, but supporters expected that even voluntary targets will spur countries to take action. They feared that pulling out of the climate deal would be a big blow to the Paris framework and could lead to other nations taking their Paris commitments less seriously.  Musk isn’t the only tech CEO who pushed Trump — unsuccessfully — to remain in the Paris framework. A coalition of companies — including tech giants like Apple, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft — have taken out a series of full-page ads in the New York Times and other papers to urge Trump to stay.  Major technology companies like Google, Apple, and Tesla are global companies, and so they tend to take a broader perspective than just the United States. They believe that pulling out of the Paris agreement will damage America’s standing in the world — and in the process hamper their ability to sell high-tech goods and services around the world.",4.5,3,"[5.0, 4.5, 4.0]"

The women told CNN that the 52-year-old reporter propositioned them for sex, grabbed their breasts and rubbed his erection on three of them. They said they did not report Halperin.  One woman said she visited Halperin in his ABC office in the early 2000s when he forced himself on her.  “I went up to have a soda and talk and — he just kissed me and grabbed my boobs,” the woman said. “I just froze. I didn’t know what to do.”  Another victim was around 25 years old when she approached Halperin for a gig during the 2004 campaign.  “The first meeting I ever had with him was in his office and he just came up from behind — I was sitting in a chair from across his desk — and he came up behind me and [while he was clothed] he pressed his body on mine, his penis, on my shoulder,” the woman said.

(AP Photo/Nick Perry)  WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — New Zealand’s incoming government is hoping to make the nation greener by planting 100 million trees each year, ensuring the electricity grid runs entirely from renewable energy, and spending more money on cycle ways and rail transport.  Jacinda Ardern, who takes over as prime minister this week, on Tuesday outlined agreements her Labour Party reached with other political parties joining them in the new government.  In addition to the environmental initiatives, Ardern also outlined plans to raise the minimum wage, stop foreigners from buying existing homes, and possibly change how New Zealand’s Reserve Bank operates.  The 37-year-old will be New Zealand’s youngest leader in more than 150 years and hopes to take the country on a more liberal path following nine years of rule by the conservative National Party.  “I don’t need to be influenced on climate change,” she said. “It will sit at the heart of what this government does.”  Ardern’s plan is for New Zealand to reduce its net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by the year 2050.  Some of the targets will require only incremental changes. New Zealand already generates about 85 percent of its electricity from renewable sources including hydroelectric, geothermal and wind. Ardern plans to increase that to 100 percent by 2035, in part by investigating whether solar panels can be used atop schools.  She said the country will need to double the amount of trees it plants each year, a goal she said was “absolutely achievable” by using land that was marginal for farming animals. Her plans also call for the government’s vehicle fleet to be green within a decade.  Not everybody is happy with the plans. Many farmers are worried they will be required to pay more if they are absorbed into an emissions trading scheme.  “There is concern that if this should happen, New Zealand will become less competitive with other food-producing nations,” said Katie Milne, the president of advocacy group Federated Farmers.  The government also plans to raise the minimum wage to 20 New Zealand dollars ($14) per hour over the next few years, a 27 percent increase over its current level. And Ardern said a review of the way the Reserve Bank operates would take into account factors such as employment levels and price stability. Currently the bank primarily considers inflation when setting interest rates.  Ardern also outlined a plan to spend 1 billion New Zealand dollars ($693 million) a year on the country’s smaller towns and regions to improve rail and other infrastructure.  “You’d be hard-pressed to find a region that hasn’t experienced neglect,” she said.  Ardern said she spoke to President Donald Trump for about five minutes on Monday after he called to congratulate her on her election win. She said Trump told her the election had received quite a bit of coverage in Washington and throughout the East Coast, and that she talked to him about New Zealand’s important role in the Asia-Pacific region.  “Our relationship with the U.S. is incredibly important,” Ardern said when asked about Trump. “That has not changed and it will not change.”",5.0,1,[5.0]

We’re just not buying this one but here’s what the media had to say about Clinton’s cancellation of some interviews while in London:  Washington Examiner reported:  Hillary Clinton canceled several media appearances Monday while on her book tour in London after she fell down the stairs and broke her toe.  “I was running down the stairs in heels with a cup of coffee in hand, I was talking over my shoulder and my heel caught and I fell backwards,” Clinton told “The Graham Nortion Show.”  “I tried to get up and it really hurt.

She was seen last night going out to dinner with Huma Abedin and a dozen body guards:  Her interview in Australia is a crazy ride:  She’s really come undone in this latest interview…Hillary Clinton became visibly irritated during an interview with Australian TV when she was asked about Wikileaks’ Assange.  The interview with local Australian TV has several delusional moments that reveal her continued bitterness and downright psychosis when it comes to the 2016 election loss to Donald Trump.  “I think Assange has become a nihilistic opportunist who does the bidding of a dictator,” Clinton said, apparently referring to Russia’s Vladimir Putin.  When the interviewer noted many people view Assange as a “martyr for free speech and freedom of information.”…Clinton wasn’t having it and shot back:  “I mean, he’s a tool of Russian intelligence. If he’s such a martyr for free speech, why doesn’t WikiLeaks ever publish anything coming out of Russia?”  The interviewer then did something our American media never does. She challenged Clinton with this question:  “Isn’t he just doing what journalists do which is publish information when they get it?”  HERE’S WHERE HILLARY GOES OFF THE RAILS:  “I don’t think so,” Hillary snapped. “I think for number one, it’s stolen information, and number two, if all you did was publish it, that would be one thing,” she asserted, before claiming there was a “concerted operation between WikiLeaks and Russia and most likely, people in the United States to, as I say, weaponized that information.”  Hillary Clinton says Julian Assange is a “tool of Russian intelligence”  HERE’S WHERE ASSANGE NAILS HILLARY:  Assange came back at Clinton with a PERFECT description of her “cold creepiness”. He tweeted out that people should “watch closely” and see that there is something “much darker” than the lying and “menacing glares”:    “There’s something wrong with Hillary Clinton. It is not just her constant lying,” he tweeted.  “It is not just that she throws off menacing glares and seethes thwarted entitlement. Watch closely. Something much darker rides along with it. A cold creepiness rarely seen.”  The interviewer goes on to ask Hillary about Fox News:  In more from the interview, it’s clear Hillary needs some therapy. She claims that Jim Comey “shivved her”. That is a prison term for being murdered with a knife. What the heck made her use that term? Now that’s REALLY creepy!

But that trend faded around the turn of the century. Since then, the labor-force participation rate of prime-age Americans has shrunk to nearly the lowest in the industrialized world.  And, as Professor Krueger noted, once workers stop looking for a job, it is tough to draw them back in. “After they leave the labor market,” he said, “people reorganize their lives.”  Indeed. A third of the prime-age workers who have left the labor force are now receiving disability benefits, meaning they are out for good, Professor Krueger estimated. Another 20 percent are in the process of applying for such benefits. In a recently released study, he estimated that about a third of prime-age men not in the labor force use prescription painkillers, namely opiates, suggesting that they will not be returning to work soon. Professor Krueger suggests that the increase in opioid prescriptions could account for about 20 percent of the decline in men’s labor-force participation from 1999 to 2015, and 25 percent of the observed decline in women’s labor-force participation.  How to get them back? In a coming study, Melissa Kearney and Katharine Abraham of the University of Maryland identify forces that have pushed workers out of the labor force before the retirement age of 65. Trade is at the top of the list, followed by technology — be it robots or other forms of automation — and disability insurance, which offers people some income in the absence of a job. Supply-side factors — incarceration, or the effect of the minimum wage on labor costs — are next.  Professor Kearney and Professor Abraham also identify policies that might draw more workers back into jobs: Improving access to high-quality education, an elusive goal despite recent gains, is critical to equip students to navigate a changing workplace. So is access to child care, to lower barriers to women’s participation in the work force. Expanding wage supports like the earned-income tax credit will be important to make work worthwhile for workers of lesser skills. On the supply side, Professor Kearney and Professor Abraham suggest that being cautious about raising the minimum wage, which could price some workers out of jobs, and reforming disability insurance to encourage recipients to seek jobs.  There is more. Discouraging the overprescription of painkillers seems like an obvious choice, given Professor Krueger’s findings. There is also a clear list of things not to be done.  For instance, restricting immigration is not the smartest policy when workers are scarce. Raising barriers to imports — inviting retaliation from trading partners — is exactly the wrong approach, especially now that the workers in cheap labor markets that put such pressure on American jobs promise to become big consumers of things made in America.  If the goal is to protect economic growth and to give American workers a shot at a new golden age of employment, closing the door on the world economy is not the solution.",3.3,5,"[4.5, 1.5, 4.0, 3.0, 3.5]"

Ten of the building's 11 floors are now devoted to retail. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan)  NEW YORK (AP) — Lord & Taylor’s flagship store in Manhattan, known for its holiday displays along Fifth Avenue, is being sold to the office space sharing company WeWork.  The nearly 100-year-old building will be converted to WeWork headquarters, with less than a quarter of the space remaining for a Lord & Taylor store. Right now, 10 of the building’s 11 floors are devoted to retail.  WeWork attracts millennials who are looking to share office space, a consumer segment that Lord & Taylor owner Hudson’s Bay and other department stores want to attract. So store executives expect the stores to benefit from WeWork members going in and out of the building, and hopes they’ll be shopping.  “This is a sign of the future,” said Faith Hope Consolo, chairman of the retail group at Douglass Elliman Real Estate. She predicted that other department stores will likely lease some of their space to corporate groups that cater to millennials. “They’re building their own traffic generators.”  Lord & Taylor will keep the whole building with its usual operations through next year’s holiday season. And the holiday displays will go on this year and next year, the company said. It didn’t say what happens beyond that. Lord & Taylor was the first to create Christmas windows for sheer entertainment, rather than for selling merchandise. It also pioneered the animated window display back in 1938.  While shoppers may have been drawn to Lord & Taylor’s windows, Consolo said she wasn’t sure how much they were shopping. Many would buy cosmetics on the first floor but didn’t often venture to the upper floors, she said. Hudson’s Bay Co., which owns Lord & Taylor, Saks Fifth Avenue and Canada’s Hudson’s Bay, said in June it was cutting 2,000 jobs in North America as it shaves costs and tries to adjust to changes in how people shop.  The $850 million sale announced Tuesday is part of a plan by Hudson’s Bay to pare down debt and reinvigorate sales. Company officials declined to say what the redesigned Lord & Taylor store of about 150,000 square feet will look like.  Richard Baker, chairman of Hudson’s Bay, told The Associated Press that WeWork will also lease space in the upper floors in three of the company main stores — Hudson’s Bay stores in Toronto and Vancouver, Canada, as well as its Galeria Kaufhof in Frankfurt, Germany.  Department stores have been struggling to follow their customers online, with many closing stores and selling lucrative real estate. Big chains like Macy’s had been under pressure from shareholders to get more value out of their real estate holdings. But Consolo agreed with Baker that the Hudson’s Bay deal with WeWork is a dramatic change in how retailers are trying to capitalize on their real estate.  “We definitely think there is a future for department stores for people who reinvest in the business,” Baker said.  On Friday, Hudson’s Bay had said that CEO Jerry Storch would step down at the end of the month.  ____  Follow Anne D’Innocenzio at http://www.Twitter.com/adinnocenzio",3.4741379310344827,58,"[3.0, 2.5, 4.5, 4.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 1.5, 3.0, 1.5, 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 3.5, 2.5, 0.5, 4.0, 0.5, 5.0, 3.0, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 5.0, 3.5, 3.0, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.0, 4.0, 3.5, 2.5, 2.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.0, 3.5, 3.0, 1.5, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5]"
981,2522,10,24,2017,2017-10-24,Vox,"Electric buses are coming, and they’re going to help fix 4 big urban problems","There is a ton of hype around electric cars right now, for understandable reasons. Several snazzy new models have been released recently, range continues improving, and ambitious cities are pledging to get rid of gas and diesel cars altogether. It’s a heady time.  But here’s a little appreciated fact: Personal vehicles are probably the most challenging to electrify cost-effectively. (Dragging one or two passengers around over long distances in a 2-ton vehicle takes a lot of energy.) The case for electrification is actually stronger for other types of vehicles.  At the top of the list: buses! City transit buses are ideal candidates for electrification.  For one thing, the world is rapidly urbanizing and particulate pollution — especially from diesel, the fuel of choice for older buses — is increasingly seen as a health crisis. Old buses drive around the city all day, at low speeds, spewing diesel smoke directly into urbanites’ faces, leading to countless illnesses and early deaths. (Diesel smoke is a big contributor to the 6.5 million deaths a year caused by air pollution.)  Electrification would mean that buses emit virtually no air pollutants or greenhouse gases. (The power plants where their electricity is generated might still generate those pollutants, but even if it is powered by coal plants, an electric bus averages far less pollution per-mile than a diesel bus.) Urban air quality would notably and immediately improve.  As a fuel, electricity is far cheaper than diesel or natural gas, and given that buses are utilized four times as much as the average personal vehicle, those savings add up. And because EVs of all kinds are simpler and have fewer parts, maintenance costs are lower.  Finally, electric buses are also just a much, much nicer experience — lower to the ground, roomier (diesel engines take up lots of space), not choked with the smell of fuel, and quieter, indeed close to silent. It is difficult to quantify the impacts of noise pollution in urban areas, but, well, imagine a dense urban area without big diesel engines roaring to life every few seconds. It would be nice.  All of this has been true for decades, of course. People were talking about battery-electric buses (BEBs) at the turn of the century. What’s changed is that the technology has advanced in leaps and bounds (range and power have doubled in just the past few years), an actual EV industry/supply chain has been established, and charging infrastructure is spreading.  The cost differential is still daunting — a BEB still costs $200,000 to $300,000 more up front — but the cumulative advantages have grown to the point that dozens of cities are rushing to replace their fleets. The latest is New York City, which announced on April 25 it will convert its public bus system to an all-electric fleet by 2040, or sooner.  Let’s take a quick look at some recent developments.  Electric bus sales are growing briskly, but will they boom?  There aren’t many reports available to the public on the global bus market (plenty of paywalled reports, if you’ve got $6,500 burning a hole in your pocket). But we can extract the gist from various summaries and, uh, purloined copies.  Analysts seem to agree that for the next 10 years or so, sales of nondiesel buses will grow much faster than diesel, though by absolute numbers diesel will remain the dominant fuel, because diesel buses are growing from a much larger base.  For instance, Navigant Research recently issued a report looking the global market for medium- and heavy-duty buses and projected this for the next 10 years.  Over the next decade, they see the global bus market expanding from just over 800,000 to over a million. The share taken by diesel will decline from 58 to 51 percent. Hybrids and BEBs, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.9 percent, will go from 21 to 22 percent by 2027. (BEBs are a growing part of that segment, with sales growing 40 percent just over the past year.)  The analysts at Freedonia Group are a little more bullish, projecting hybrids and BEBs to hit 22 percent by 2021. P&S Market Research projects a CAGR of 3.5 percent. All analysts agree that growth of nondiesel buses will be fastest in the developing world, particularly China and India, where air pollution issues are worst.  In short, analysts are being conservative (as analysts are wont to do), projecting steady incremental growth based on current trends. If they’re right, BEBs will grow, but will remain a relatively marginal presence in the global bus fleet for the next decade.  Perhaps not surprisingly, Ryan Popple, the CEO of electric bus company Proterra, thinks those analysts are missing the boat (or, uh, the bus).  In a February 2017 podcast interview with The Energy Gang, Popple predicted that, in the US alone, BEBs will represent a third of all new transit sales by 2020, 50 percent by 2025, and 100 percent by 2030.  In other words, he thinks BEBs will hit an inflection point, growth will radically accelerate, and they will eat the urban transit market whole, in fairly short order.  Why is Popple so confident? It has to do with lifecycle costs.  Costs, broadly considered  A recent paper from researchers at Carnegie Mellon University set out to compare different bus options based on their total lifecycle costs, which means construction, fuel, maintenance, infrastructure, air pollution impacts — everything.  They found that BEBs are currently competitive, on a total lifecycle-cost basis, with liquid natural gas (LNG), compressed natural gas (CNG), and hybrid diesel buses. That means BEBs can plausibly compete with roughly 40 percent of the current bus market, without any subsidies.  But here’s the twist. It is typical, in the US, for local transit agencies to get a big chunk of their transit capital funding from the federal government (specifically, the Federal Transit Administration). So the researchers modeled what would happen from a city’s perspective if 80 percent of the upfront capital costs of their bus purchases were covered.  Here’s what they found — note that there are two columns for each type of bus, the left with 80 percent of capital covered, the right without.  Because capital costs are the biggest chunk of BEB lifecycle costs — remember, they cost $200,000 to $300,000 more than diesel buses up front — outside capital helps them the most. In fact, for cities with federal funding, it makes BEBs the lowest cost option. (Note that this would be true even without considering air pollution or climate benefits.)  This point is important and worth dwelling on a moment. It is a perpetual problem for clean energy technology that it costs more up front but saves more money over the long haul; purchasing decisions tend to be made by myopic agents biased against upfront costs. Most clean energy markets require tweaks and incentives to overcome this misalignment of incentives.  Municipal transit decisions in the US have a built-in counter-balance to that problem. Municipal officials, because they do not have to raise the full upfront capital, are freed to consider lifecycle costs. This makes municipal transit a huge potential market for EBs.  There’s still a great deal of bias toward the status quo, of course — any new technology has to overcome it. Cities know how to plan for and deal with liquid-fueled fleets. The needs of electric fleets are somewhat murky.  Luckily, the barriers to BEB adoption — the high upfront costs, the limited range, the unfamiliarity of charging infrastructure — are being rapidly overcome. Let’s take a brief look at how the market and technologies are evolving (faster than anyone predicted). As you’ll see, a snapshot of today’s costs scarcely does justice to the potential.  As BEB tech advances, the market grows and big players jostle for advantage  The bulk of the buzz in the BEB space is around California-based Proterra. It was founded way back in 2008, but in 2014, the midst of a slump, it hired CEO Ryan Popple away from Tesla to turn the company around and make it more, uh, Tesla-ish.  And that’s just what he’s done. Popple pulled some top talent from Tesla and, crucially, adopted Tesla’s strategy of focusing exclusively on EVs, designing them from the ground up rather than retrofitting existing vehicle designs. That has meant some bold choices, but it seems to be paying off — the company is growing, drawing new funding, and riding a huge wave of hype, straining to keep up with demand (like, uh, Tesla).  To date, Proterra has sold 400 BEBs to a variety of cities around the US, but it is rapidly ramping up manufacturing capacity, hoping to crank out 400 BEBs a year going forward.  Because it uses ultra-lightweight carbon fiber for the body rather than steel or aluminum, Proterra’s buses are thousands of pounds lighter than their competitors’. Combined with custom-designed batteries, its newest model is producing jaw-dropping results.  To wit: Last month, Proterra’s brand new, 40-foot Catalyst E2 Max traveled more than 1,000 miles on a single charge. (Yes, you read that right.)  That 1,101.2-mile drive set the new all-time world record for distance traveled by an electric vehicle — a record previously held by an experimental one-seater EV that was, according to the company, 46 times lighter.  The long, flat battery packs in the floor and ceiling hold between 440 and 660 kWh of energy (double the company’s previous bus), translating to a nominal range of between 200 and 350 miles, depending on the configuration. That is, needless to say, longer than most transit routes in America.  The bus boasts two electric motors, which give it 510 horsepower for acceleration (compared to a diesel bus’s 280) and allow it to tackle 26 percent grades, “more than twice the performance of the average 35- or 40-foot diesel bus, and 72 percent better than competing electric transit vehicles.”  In short, relative to diesel buses, Proterra’s new bus is quieter, accelerates faster, copes with hills better, smells better, has comparable range, and boasts radically lower fuel costs. Not bad.  Proterra is also licensing its drivetrain — it will be used by the EU’s Van Hool for its new line of BEBs — and has (like, ahem, Tesla) open-sourced its fast-charging technology, which can fully charge a bus in 10 minutes.  Proterra recently opened a new manufacturing facility outside LA, hoping to ramp production to keep up with demand.  It is far from alone, though, in this growing market. Earlier this month, Chinese automaker BYD, backed by billionaire financier Warren Buffet, unveiled a massive expansion of its manufacturing facility in Lancaster, California, more than quadrupling it to 450,000 square-feet. (It is powered entirely by renewable energy.) The facility will be cranking out not just buses, but electric trucks for various medium- and heavy-duty applications.  Volvo, a leader in the space, recently unveiled a schmancy new version of its 7900 series BEB. It gets 125 miles on a full charge, but, interestingly, Volvo is also offering wireless charging embedded in roads as part of a “total solution” for cities.  Hyundai recently unveiled a BEB (the “Elec City,” get it?) with 180-mile range. Volkswagen, still reeling from its diesel scandal, will invest $1.7 billion in developing electric (and eventually autonomous) trucks and buses. New Flyer, one of the world’s biggest transit companies, recently unveiled its new Xcelsior Charge BEB, with a 200-mile range. Tata Motors is going crazy with BEBs in India. And so on.  As these companies scale up, it creates more and more of an actual industry, a supply chain of parts and expertise that aspiring new companies can draw on. With scale and learning come falling costs.  Right now, BEBs are just barely on the cusp for many cities — a close and agonizing economic decision. But as battery costs continue to fall, economies of scale kick in, and simple urban envy goes to work, the market will expand rapidly, the business case will become clearer, and the trickle of cities will become a flood. It has already begun.  Here in #Winnipeg, touring the New Flyer bus factory floor.

McKenna (@ec_minister) October 13, 2016  Cities are going gaga for BEBs  In October, representatives from a dozen global cities signed the Fossil-Fuel-Free Streets Declaration, which pledges them to purchasing only zero-emissions buses (i.e., BEBs) starting in 2025. From North America, Vancouver, BC, Los Angeles, and Seattle signed.  Los Angeles has committed to transitioning its entire bus fleet (the nation’s second largest, which previously transitioned from diesel to CNG) to electricity by 2030. It recently ordered 60 new 40-foot BEBs from BYD and 35 new 60-foot, articulated BEBs from New Flyer, with an option to purchase 65 more after testing.  “We have two choices,” said Mayor Eric Garcetti in July. “We can wait for others, and follow, at the expense of residents’ health — or lead and innovate, and reduce emissions as quickly as possible. I’d much rather do the latter.”  King County Transit, which serves Seattle, recently announced a commitment to purchasing 120 BEBs by 2020, starting with 73 from Proterra (“more than 20 percent of Proterra’s entire sales since its inception,” notes Fred Lambert). Eight will go in service this year; 11 more next year.  But LA and Seattle are not alone. New York, which has the largest transit fleet in the country, is testing 10 all-electric buses and plans to purchase 60 more by 2019 and go all-electric by 2040, InsideClimate News reports. Washington, DC now has 14. Chicago has plans to buy 20 to 30 BEBs. Louisville, Kentucky has 15. Twin Cities’ Metro Transit is getting six this year. Park City, Utah, will get seven (in addition to the six it has). Portland, Oregon, will get five. Albuquerque, New Mexico, is ordering 18 60-foot, articulated BEBs from BYD. Up in Canada, Edmonton will buy only BEBs beginning in 2020, while Montreal will poke its toe in the water with three. And so on.  And that’s just North America, where BEBs are currently 1 percent of the fleet. In China, they’re already at 20 percent. If I tried to cover all the Asian and EU cities electrifying their bus fleets, this post would never end.  The future is BEB  The municipal transit market, while extremely large, is also fairly slow-moving. Buying buses is a big decision, transit planning tends to be a plodding process, and federal grants take forever.  Nonetheless, I’m with Popple. Contra Navigant et al, I don’t think this is going to be a matter of steady linear growth for the next 10 years. At some point, likely within the decade, the market will cross a threshold and start rocketing up the bottom of the “S curve” new technologies tend to follow. No analyst wants to predict exactly when that will happen — they’ll look dumb if they guess too early, but won’t look dumb if they’re too late like all the other analysts — but I don’t think it’s very far away.  BEBs are already tiptoeing around at the edge of penciling out for lots of cities. As the industry scales up, costs come down, and the benefits of BEBs become visible to the urban public, more and more cities will board the bandwagon. Eventually, the lifecycle-cost lines will cross decisively and there will be no coherent case for not going all electric.  My prediction: That virtuous cycle begins relatively soon and, as Popple says, by 2030, BEBs will be the default choice for new transit.  In 2030, no city official would dream of ordering a deafeningly loud, literally poisonous people-moving machine that depends on tens of thousands of gallons of imported liquid fossil fuel at fluctuating, unpredictable prices.

Edgar Hoover as he talks about the death of Lee Harvey Oswald, released for the first time on Thursday, Oct. 26, 2017, is photographed in Washington. The public is getting a look at thousands of secret government files related to President John F. Kennedy's assassination, but hundreds of other documents will remain under wraps for now. The government was required by Thursday to release the final batch of files related to Kennedy's assassination in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963. But President Donald Trump delayed the release of some of the files, citing security concerns. (AP Photo/Jon Elswick)  WASHINGTON (AP) — It was a showdown 25 years in the making: With the world itching to finally get a look at classified Kennedy assassination files, and the deadline for their release just hours away, intelligence officials were still angling for a way to keep their secrets. President Donald Trump, the one man able to block the release, did not appreciate their persistence. He did not intend to make this easy.  Like much else surrounding investigations of the 1963 killing of President John F. Kennedy, this week’s release of 2,800 records from the JFK files was anything but smooth. It came together only at the last minute, with White House lawyers still fielding late-arriving requests for additional redactions in the morning and an irritated Trump continuing to resist signing off on the request, according to an account by two White House officials. They spoke only on condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions.  The tale of the final hours before the congressionally mandated 25-year release deadline on Thursday adds a new chapter to the story of Trump’s troubled relationship with his spy agencies. He again flashed his skepticism and unpredictability in dealing with agencies long accustomed to a level of deference. Intelligence officials, meanwhile, were again left scratching their heads about a president whose impulses they cannot predict.  And those officials had their own story tell, some rejecting the notion they were slow to act on Trump’s expectations for the documents. The CIA began work months ago to get its remaining assassination-related documents ready for release on Thursday, according to a person familiar with the process. The person, who was not authorized to publicly to discuss the process and spoke only on condition of anonymity, said the goal was to have all the agency’s documents ready to be released in full or with national security redactions before the deadline.  Since taking office, Trump has challenged the integrity of intelligence leaders, moved to exert more control over U.S. spying agencies and accused his predecessor of using government spycraft to monitor his campaign. In the JFK files matter, one White House official said, Trump wanted to make clear he wouldn’t be bullied by the agencies.  Whatever occurred in the lead-up to deadline day, Trump was irritated Thursday that agencies still were arguing for more redactions. The president earlier in the week had tweeted to tease the release of the documents, heightening the sense of drama on a subject that has sparked the imaginations of conspiracy theorists for decades. Under a 1992 law, all of the records related to the assassination were to be made public unless explicitly withheld by the president.  Just before the release Thursday, Trump wrote in a memorandum that he had “no choice” but to agree to requests from the CIA and FBI to keep thousands of documents secret because of the possibility that releasing the information could still harm national security. Two aides said Trump was upset by what he perceived to be overly broad secrecy requests, adding that the agencies had been explicitly warned about his expectation that redactions be kept to a minimum.  “The president and White House have been very clear with all agencies for weeks: They must be transparent and disclose all information possible,” White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah said Friday.  Late last week, Trump received his first official briefing on the release in an Oval Office meeting that included Chief of Staff John Kelly, White House Counsel Don McGahn and National Security Council legal adviser John Eisenberg. Trump made it clear he was unsatisfied with the pace of declassification.  Trump’s tweets, an official said, were meant as a signal to the intelligence community to take seriously his threats to release the documents in their entirety.  According to White House officials, Trump accepted that some of the records contained references to sensitive sources and methods used by the intelligence community and law enforcement and that declassification could harm American foreign policy interests. But after having the scope of the redactions presented to him, Trump told aides he did not believe them to be in the spirit of the law.  On Thursday, Trump’s top aides presented him with an alternative to simply acquiescing to the agency requests: He could temporarily allow the redactions while ordering the agencies to launch a new comprehensive examination of the records still withheld or redacted in part. Trump accepted the suggestion, ordering that agencies be “extremely circumspect” about keeping the remaining documents secret at the end of the 180-day assessment.  “After strict consultation with General Kelly, the CIA and other agencies, I will be releasing ALL JFK files other than the names and addresses of any mentioned person who is still living,” Trump wrote in a Friday tweet. “I am doing this for reasons of full disclosure, transparency and in order to put any and all conspiracy theories to rest.”  Trump returned to the topic in a Saturday night tweet: “JFK Files are released, long ahead of schedule!” The deadline set by law came Thursday, the day the documents were released.  ___  Associated Press writer Deb Riechmann contributed to this report.",3.8333333333333335,3,"[3.5, 4.0, 4.0]"

Public education officials in New Mexico have retreated from proposed science standards that would have deleted or omitted references to evolution, human contributions to global warming and Earth's age. (AP Photo/Morgan Lee, file)  SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — Public education officials in New Mexico have retreated from proposed science standards that would have deleted or omitted references to evolution, human contributions to global warming and Earth’s age.  Scores of scientists and engineers from Los Alamos National Laboratory — the birthplace of the atomic bomb that is located in energy-dominant New Mexico — joined a broad backlash against the standards promoted by Republican Gov. Susana Martinez’s administration.  Responding to public outrage, education officials went back this week to a template followed by at least 18 states and designed to make science education more engaging and effective.  ___  WHAT PROMPTED THE FIGHT?  In its first overhaul of science teaching guidelines since 2003, New Mexico relied on Next Generation Science Standards designed by a consortium of states and the National Academy of Sciences.  Public Education Secretary Christopher Ruszkowski proposed a New Mexico-specific version that would ensure “flexibility and local control” for science materials, curriculum and classroom lessons.  That version dropped references to evolution and Earth being 4.6 billion years old. The study of global warming was couched in vague terms of temperature “fluctuations.” It added guidelines for studying the state’s oil and natural gas industry, mining and ski resort snowmaking.  Science teachers associations recognized concessions to those who doubt human-caused climate change and scientific evolutionary theory. More than 60 leading scientists at Los Alamos took out a full-page newspaper ad, pressuring state officials to backtrack.  School boards and business associations described a setback in efforts to prepare students for college and careers.  Hundreds flocked to a public hearing to denounce the plan as teachers unions, faith leaders and Democratic officials protested on the education department’s lawn. Indoors and out, no one spoke in support of the science changes.  ___  WHY ARE SCIENCE STANDARDS DIVISIVE?  The proposal would have left less-experienced teachers at the mercy of personal opinions about climate change from parents and onlookers, said Glenn Branch, deputy director of the nonprofit National Center for Science Education that defends teaching evolution and other science-based classroom subjects.  He said science standards have become a battleground for climate change issues in several states, citing West Virginia as the most prominent example of evasive language in school teaching guidelines.  Plus, in the energy-reliant state of New Mexico, public school districts depend on billions of annual dollars in tax revenue, fees and royalties from the oil and natural gas sector that are channeled through state government.  School administrators in oil-heavy southeastern New Mexico tread lightly on what causes climate change.  “We literally have gas wells right next to our playgrounds,” said T.J. Parks, superintendent of Hobbs Municipal Schools. “I’m certainly not going to throw any stones at the oil industry. That is who we are.”  At the same time, Parks said advanced placement classes and testing dominate teaching decisions about science in his district. In Hobbs, there was no controversy, he said.  Chris Norris, who has two elementary school children in the Santa Fe public schools, said the proposal felt like an assault on scientific theory and the state’s enlightened reputation.  “It bothers me intensely,” he said. “It doesn’t represent us.”  Ruszkowski, the head of public education, said his office developed the tailored science standards during informal conversations with students, teachers and parents. He has declined to name anyone in those discussions.  ___  WHAT WAS THE SOLUTION?  Ruszkowski said Wednesday night that the science standards would not include the contentious changes. The final version trimmed passages about local accomplishments in science and industry from 35 to a half-dozen.  People on both sides claimed a measure of victory, including Ruszkowski for following through on promises to listen to the public.  State Sen. Mimi Stewart of Albuquerque, chairwoman of an influential education committee, expressed pride in the outpouring of public concern — from scientists in particular — noting that the Democratic-controlled Legislature has little authority to intervene in education department decisions on academic standards.",4.029411764705882,17,"[4.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 2.0, 5.0, 4.5, 1.5, 4.0, 3.0, 5.0, 4.0, 2.5, 5.0]"
1368,2970,11,3,2017,2017-11-03,Vox,The Senate’s tax plan would cut alcohol taxes. That would be a public health disaster.,"Deep within the latest Republican tax plan in the Senate, there’s a new idea that could literally put lives at risk: The proposal would cut taxes on alcohol.  The alcohol industry has been lobbying for such cuts for years. It’s finally getting what it wanted: The Senate proposal would cut federal alcohol excise taxes by 16 percent by effectively reducing taxes across the board for beer, wine, and liquor over the next two years, according to an analysis by Adam Looney at Brookings.  To many Americans, this might seem like a good idea. It means cheaper booze, after all.  But economists and public health experts argue this would amount to a public health disaster; alcohol is if anything underpriced, they argue, given the external costs that it already carries. Consider: Alcohol is linked to 88,000 deaths each year in the US — making it the third leading cause of preventable death in America after smoking and the combination of poor diet and physical inactivity. And death is only one external cost of alcohol, with others including more crime, car crashes, and reduced economic output. All of this is enabled by cheap alcohol, which makes it easier to drink in excess.  This problem would be made worse by Congress’s tax cuts. Looney analyzes the research on alcohol prices and estimates that “the legislation will cause … approximately 1,550 total alcohol-related deaths annually from all causes.” Since the tax cuts expire after 2019, that amounts to 3,100 more preventable deaths over the next two years — and more if Congress extends the tax cuts further.  From Looney’s perspective, the alcohol tax should actually be higher. For one, Congress has failed to raise federal alcohol taxes, which are separate from state taxes on alcohol, since 1991. (They were increased somewhat regularly before then.) This has already left the taxes in a pretty bad state: As the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) noted in 2016, “current excise tax rates on alcohol are far lower than historical levels when adjusted to include the effects of inflation.”  “The great opportunity we have is to restore taxes to the real value that they had a few decades ago,” Philip Cook, a public policy expert at Duke University who wrote Paying the Tab: The Costs and Benefits of Alcohol Control, previously told me. “That’s justified by the current social costs of drinking, and would have all kinds of beneficial effects, while being justified just from the point of view that drinkers should pay for the damage that they do.”  Congress is not only shirking this opportunity, but it’s actually taking the opposite route. Based on all the research on alcohol taxes, that will lead to more preventable deaths.  How the Senate proposal would cut alcohol taxes  The current Senate tax plan would make several big changes to alcohol taxes, which are broadly separated between beer, distilled spirits (liquor), and wine:  It would cut the per-barrel tax for beer from $18 to $16 for the first 6 million barrels that brewers produce or import, with anything beyond that still taxed at $18. And for small domestic brewers, the rate would be cut from $7 to $3.50 for the first 60,000 barrels and $16 beyond that.  It would enact a tiered system for distilled spirits. Today, distilled spirits are taxed at $13.50 per proof gallon. Under the proposal, they would be taxed at $2.70 per proof gallon for the first 100,000 gallons produced or imported, $13.34 for above 100,000 and up to about 22.1 million gallons, and the current $13.50 rate beyond that.  It would give producers and importers greater access to a wine tax credit.  It would eliminate some other regulations on alcohol.  The tax cuts would last through 2019, but Congress could extend them at any point.  The tax cuts are aimed at supposedly helping small producers. But Looney of Brookings argues that, based on his analysis, “the benefits will accrue to producers across the board, providing windfalls to the large oligopolies that dominate the beer, wine, and spirits industry — and to foreign producers.”  The changes would also create a potential loophole for large producers, particularly foreign ones that are more difficult for US law enforcement officials to oversee and regulate. Looney gives an example: “For instance, a large French producer who would not otherwise qualify for the lower rates could divide its production among multiple labels or multiple importers, each below the 250,000 bottle limit, evading the tax and producing a comparative advantage for the foreign producer over the American producer.”  The changes need approval from the House, Senate, and White House. It’s unclear what the tax plan’s chances of passing — much less this particular part of the plan — are.  Congress could raise the alcohol tax instead  Instead of cutting alcohol taxes, Congress could consider raising them. In fact, there’s a plan out there that already explains how this could work.  The CBO routinely releases a report called “Options for Reducing the Deficit.” As part of this, it analyzes the possibility of raising the federal government’s alcohol excise taxes.  In the 2016 report, the CBO looked at what would happen if excise taxes were raised to $16 per proof gallon for all alcoholic beverages, along with the elimination of tax credits for small producers and exemptions for personal use. It found that this would raise $70.4 billion over 10 years.  How? First, it would help level taxes between different kinds of alcoholic beverages. As the CBO explained, “the alcohol content of beer and wine is taxed at a much lower rate than the alcohol content of distilled spirits in part because the taxes are determined on the basis of different liquid measures.” This leads to big disparities:  Distilled spirits are measured in proof gallons, which denote a liquid gallon that is 50 percent alcohol by volume. The current excise tax levied on those spirits, $13.50 per proof gallon, translates to about 21 cents per ounce of pure alcohol. Beer, by contrast, is measured by the barrel, and the current tax rate of $18 per barrel translates to about 10 cents per ounce of pure alcohol (under the assumption that the alcohol content of the beer is 4.5 percent). The current levy on table wine is $1.07 per gallon, or about 6 cents per ounce of pure alcohol (assuming an alcohol content of 13 percent). Wines with high volumes of alcohol, and sparkling wines, face a higher tax per gallon.  A $16 per proof gallon tax for all alcoholic beverages, along with the elimination of related tax credits and exemptions, would level the playing field.  It would also increase alcohol taxes across the board, the CBO found: “Under this option, the federal excise tax on a 750-milliliter bottle (commonly referred to as a fifth) of distilled spirits would rise from about $2.14 to $2.54. The tax on a six-pack of beer at 4.5 percent alcohol by volume would jump from about 33 cents to 81 cents, and the tax on a 750-milliliter bottle of wine with 13 percent alcohol by volume would increase from about 21 cents to 82 cents.”  This is just one idea for raising alcohol taxes. Some experts would like to see taxes raised by more or less. But since the CBO has actually reviewed this proposal, it offers a useful starting point — one that would raise $70.4 billion over 10 years.  An alcohol tax increase would bring huge gains for public health and safety  Obviously, this means your alcohol will cost more — 40 cents for a fifth of distilled spirits, nearly 50 cents for a six-pack of beer, and more than 60 cents for a typical bottle of wine.  “What the hell, man?” you might be thinking. “Why do you want the government all over my booze?”  The simple answer: It would save lives.  Raising alcohol taxes would increase the price of alcohol, which would make drinking more expensive, which would make people less likely to excessively drink. So fewer people would be getting drunk and doing the kinds of dumb things people do while drunk. That includes not just drunk driving but other alcohol-related problems like crime — 40 percent of violent crimes in the US involve alcohol in some way — and risky sex.  “It’s a disinhibition theory,” Charles Branas, a researcher at Columbia University, previously told me. “So it’s not so much aggressiveness, but that decisions and judgment that would normally be held in check are suddenly disinhibited under consumption of alcohol.”  One question with this is, well, does it work? Sure, you can increase the tax and make alcohol cost more. But does that actually get people to drink less?  The research shows a higher alcohol tax not only gets people to drink less, but has a particular impact on excessive drinking and its negative outcomes.  The Task Force on Community Preventive Services in 2010 reviewed the research on alcohol’s “price elasticity,” which is how much consumption changes with price. The results were clear: “Nearly all studies, including those with different study designs, found that there was an inverse relationship between the tax or price of alcohol and indices of excessive drinking or alcohol-related health outcomes. Among studies restricted to underage populations, most found that increased taxes were also signifıcantly associated with reduced consumption and alcohol-related harms.”  This chart shows the findings, with each number representing the percentage effect on excess consumption for every 1 percent increase in the price of alcohol:  There’s a simple explanation for why higher alcohol taxes are effective for reducing excessive drinking in particular: If someone is only buying a six-pack of beer or one bottle of wine a week, then a price increase of 50 or 60 cents probably won’t mean much. But as someone buys more and more, that extra cost builds up — and eventually becomes inhibitive.  Other research backs up the idea. David Roodman, a senior adviser for the Open Philanthropy Project, has conducted really thorough, impressive reviews of the research, from the effects of incarceration on crime to the domestic economic impacts of immigration. He also in 2015 took a look at the research on the alcohol tax. His findings were incredible (emphasis mine):  The literature on this topic is large, and at first glance it seemed that the high-quality studies contradicted each other. Yet as I dug deeper, I found a pattern: the larger the experiment — the larger the price change — the clearer the effects. In the end, I believe the preponderance of the evidence says that higher prices do correlate with less drinking and lower incidence of problems such as cirrhosis deaths. And I see little reason to doubt the obvious explanation: higher prices cause less drinking. A rough rule of thumb is that each 1% increase in alcohol price reduces drinking by 0.5%. Extrapolating from some of the most powerful studies, I estimate an even larger impact on the death rate from alcohol-caused diseases: 1-3% within months. By extension, a 10% price increase would cut the death rate 9-25%. For the US in 2010, this represents 2,000-6,000 averted deaths/year.  To put it another way, paying about 50 cents more for a six-pack of Bud Light would probably save thousands of lives every single year.  This is a conservative estimate. It only counts deaths from alcohol-caused diseases. The number of saved lives would be higher if it accounted for alcohol-related deaths due to violence, car crashes, and other problems.  And yes, a higher alcohol tax would have an effect in those other areas as well. A 2010 review of the research in the American Journal of Public Health, for example, concluded, “Our results suggest that doubling the alcohol tax would reduce alcohol-related mortality by an average of 35%, traffic crash deaths by 11%, sexually transmitted disease by 6%, violence by 2%, and crime by 1.4%.”  In short, higher alcohol prices — and taxes — really do reduce alcohol-related problems, including heavy drinking and underage consumption.  A common counterargument is that higher alcohol taxes could lead to job losses, since the alcohol industry may be forced to fire workers or hire fewer people to make up for the profits lost as a result of the taxes and as people cut back on their drinking. But studies and researchers have found that the revenue from the taxes and the spending shift from alcohol to non-alcohol products can lead to, on net, more jobs.  But even if higher alcohol taxes lead to fewer jobs in some cases, they could still be worth it. Jobs aren’t everything; public health and safety matter too.  By simply raising alcohol taxes, America could save lives, combat crime, and slow the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. That does mean you’ll have to pay a bit more at the checkout line next time you buy your favorite chardonnay, or maybe you’ll have to pass on the chardonnay altogether — but the research suggests it’d be worth the cost.",4.071428571428571,7,"[4.0, 2.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 3.5]"

Trump begins a five country trip through Asia traveling to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)  JOINT BASE PEARL HARBOR-HICKAM, Hawaii (AP) — President Donald Trump paid a solemn visit to the memorial at Pearl Harbor, a sacred journey for a commander-in-chief about to depart on an Asia trip that will be shadowed by fears of another international conflict.  Trump saluted Friday after entering the USS Arizona memorial following a short boat ride with first lady Melania Trump. They approached a wreath of white flowers — a gift from the couple — and watched as two sailors who stood beside it at attention placed the wreath near a wall of names of the fallen.  The Trumps then tossed white flower petals into the waters above the battleship’s sunken hull, as the president then peered down where the rusted wreckage is visible at the water’s surface.  Nearly 1,200 crew members died on the USS Arizona during the December 7, 1941 surprise attack by Japan that plunged the U.S. into World War II.  Trump, who had spoken earlier in the day about being eager to see the sacred site for the first time, appeared moved by the visit. As the wreath was quietly placed into position, Trump crossed his arms in front of him, closing his eyes as he bowed his head in remembrance.  President Trump is preparing for his first official trip to Asia with North Korea tensions at the fore. AP’s Asia-Pacific News Director previews his visit which includes stops in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. (Nov. 3)  As the sun began to fade over the Pacific, Trump then listened intently to a National Park Service tour guide, stopping briefly at a display that explained how some survivors of the attack, when they die years later, have chosen to be cremated and have their ashes placed in the sunken ship alongside the remains of their fallen colleagues.  Trump said not a word about North Korea or its nuclear ambitions on Friday, the eve of his first official visit to Asia. He will arrive in Japan on Sunday morning, the first of five countries he will visit over 11 days as he exhorts Asian allies to increase pressure on Pyongyang to abandon its deadly ambitions.  Hawaii acted as a sort of midway point on Trump’s trip halfway around the world. He arrived at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam Friday after a daylong flight from Washington.  The president quickly donned a lei after he left Air Force One with his wife, who also wore a wreath of flowers. He signed autographs and gave high-fives to kids who were among a group of civilians and service members that gathered for the arrival.  Trump wasn’t the only attraction to arrive on base. A few in the crowd shouted their admiration for White House chief of staff John Kelly.  “We love you Gen. Kelly,” one person shouted at the retired four-star Marine general who stood several feet behind the president.  Trump was briefed by leaders of the U.S. Pacific Command. The growing threat from North Korea — a crisis that will shadow the entire trip — was expected to be among the topics discussed. Trump was also meeting with the governors of Alaska, Hawaii and Pacific U.S. territories, all potential targets of any successful attempt by North Korea to strike the U.S. with a nuclear-tipped missile.  “We are going to visit very shortly, Pearl Harbor, which I’ve read about, spoken about, heard about, studied, but I haven’t seen. And that is going to be very exciting for me,” Trump said at the start of a briefing with leaders of the U.S. Pacific Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in the region.  The USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor marks the final resting place of more than 1,000 sailors and Marines who were killed on the battleship during the surprise attack on what President Franklin Roosevelt deemed “a date which we live in infamy.” Accessible only by boat, the memorial straddles the ship’s sunken hull.  A total of more than 2,300 sailors, soldiers and Marines died as a result of the attack, as well as 68 civilians, according to the National Park Service.  The visit to the memorial comes soon after Trump was embroiled in a controversy over his attempt to console the grieving families of America’s war dead. The family of one of the four soldiers killed in a Niger ambush last month said the president disrespected them when he called to offer a condolences, a charge Trump vehemently denied.  And The Associated Press discovered that a number of families of soldiers killed since Trump took office had not received a call from the president, despite his claim that he had called nearly all of them.  ___  Associated Press writer Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this report.  ___  Follow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire",3.4285714285714284,7,"[5.0, 4.5, 2.5, 1.5, 4.0, 1.5, 5.0]"

The late Robert Morin, a 50-year staff member of the Dimond Library at the University of New Hampshire, shocked the community after his passing when they learned that he had left his entire $4 million fortune to the school. Morin, who was also a graduate of the university, asked that $100,000 of his fortune go directly to the library. He told his financial advisor that he trusted the school to “figure out what to do with” the rest.  Administrators drew the ire of students and alumni when they announced that they had decided to use $1 million of Morin’s gift for a video scoreboard for the school’s newly renovated football stadium. Community members weren’t happy with the decision, arguing that the stadiums $25 million budget should have been more than enough.  “Apparently, $25 million just wasn’t enough,” wrote one graduate, arguing that the decision is “a complete disgrace to the spirit and memory of Robert Morin.”  Another University of New Hampshire alumnus echoed the same sentiment: “I am not inherently opposed to some of the money going to the football program. I am opposed to it going to a scoreboard which, in the age of planned obsolescence, will be out of date in 5? 10? Years.”  “Use it to endow a scholarship for a player who wants to go to grad school maybe. … Pay it forward; make it meaningful,” she added.  Administrators at the University of New Hampshire tried to justify the decision by claiming that Morin became a passionate fan of the school’s football team in the last 15 months of his life. “In the last 15 months of his life Morin lived in an assisted living center where he started watching football games on television, mastering the rules and names of the players and teams,” the school wrote in a 2016 press release.  An investigative piece on the controversy published this week by Deadspin argues that the university used Morin as a marketing prop. “It was on measures like this that UNH cheated Morin by treating him less like a human being than a marketing prop,” author Craig Fehrman wrote. “This treatment had started early, of course, during those initial PR huddles, and it only got worse once a real backlash to the scoreboard emerged.”  “The librarian’s fandom had absolutely nothing to do with the scoreboard,” Fehrman added, “but through a careful and shameless juxtaposition, UNH implied that it had.”  Fortunately, $2.5 million from the gift will go towards a new career center for University of New Hampshire students and alumni.",3.033333333333333,15,"[0.5, 5.0, 3.0, 2.5, 5.0, 3.5, 3.0, 0.5, 3.0, 5.0, 2.0, 4.0, 4.0, 0.5, 4.0]"

Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, meet before the start of a hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Oct. 18, 2017, the morning after they reached a deal to resume federal payments to health insurers that President Donald Trump had halted. Sen. Alexander says Trump called him Wednesday morning ""to be encouraging"" of bipartisan efforts to come up with a plan to stabilize health insurance premiums. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)  WASHINGTON (AP) — The authors of a bipartisan plan to calm health insurance markets said Wednesday they’ll push the proposal forward, even as President Donald Trump’s stance ricocheted from supportive to disdainful to arm’s-length and the plan’s fate teetered.  “If something can happen, that’s fine,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “But I won’t do anything to enrich the insurance companies because right now the insurance companies are being enriched. They’ve been enriched by Obamacare like nothing anybody has ever seen before.”  The agreement by Sens. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Patty Murray, D-Wash., on a two-year extension of federal subsidies to insurers that Trump has blocked gained an important new foe. The anti-abortion National Right to Life said it opposed the measure because it lacked language barring people from using their federally subsidized coverage to buy policies covering abortion, said Jennifer Popik, the group’s top lobbyist.  In another blow, Doug Andres, spokesman for House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said Ryan “does not see anything that changes his view that the Senate should keep its focus on repeal and replace of Obamacare.” With hard-right conservatives wielding considerable influence and unwilling to prop up President Barack Obama’s health care law, it was unclear if Ryan would be willing to even bring the measure to his chamber’s floor.  President Donald Trump is expressing support for an agreement struck by two leading lawmakers to extend federal payments to health insurers. (Oct. 17)  Overall, it was a bad day for the bipartisan accord, with several Republicans conceding that it likely needed Trump’s backing to survive.  “Without the president supporting it, I don’t think you have the votes in the House or the Senate,” No. 3 Senate GOP leader John Thune of South Dakota told reporters, adding, “We’re stalled out.”  Alexander and Murray shook hands on their agreement this week after months of intermittent talks. Failure to restore the federal payments to insurers could result in higher premiums for millions buying their own individual policies and drive carriers from unprofitable markets. Many in Congress would love to avoid blame for two such tumultuous events.  The compromise has won warm endorsements from Democrats and some Republicans. It includes steps won by Republicans to make it easier for insurers to avoid some coverage requirements under Obama’s 2010 overhaul.  But Trump has lambasted the subsidies as insurance company bailouts.  “It’s not a full approach and we need something to go a little further,” said White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders.  The money reimburses carriers for lowering co-payments and deductibles for about 6 million lower-income customers, which the companies must do under Obama’s statute.  Without those funds, insurers would likely boost premiums by an average 20 percent, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has projected. This would especially hit many buying their own health insurance who make too much to qualify for tax credits that help reduce premiums for lower earners.  Confusingly, Trump praised the bipartisan agreement early Tuesday as a “very good solution,” only to berate it in an evening speech. Some said his objections Wednesday to enriching insurers could be addressed by strengthening language in the compromise to ensure the money directly benefits customers, not companies.  “We will keep working on it,” said Alexander. He said he and Murray would formally unveil the bill Thursday and predicted that “some form of the proposal” would become law by year’s end. It could become part of a must-pass bill preventing a federal shutdown due in December.  “The president has had six positions on our bill,” Murray told reporters. Asked if the measure was still alive, she said, “Of course it is.”  Alexander said Trump called him Wednesday morning and encouraged him to continue his effort, but left wiggle room.  “I may want to add something to it,” Alexander said in a brief interview with The Associated Press, describing what Trump told him about the deal. “And it may have to be part of a larger negotiation.”  Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, criticized the plan, saying: “It would last two years and spend a whopping amount of money and not solve the problem and lead us down a path of never getting the problem done.” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has been non-committal.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said to address Trump’s aversion to enriching insurers, Democrats had offered to delay the measure’s impact for a month after enactment to let insurers lower premiums after payments were restored. Insurers in some states have installed higher premiums for next year, anticipating the subsidies would end. Schumer said White House officials rejected that idea.  GOP co-sponsors include Sens. John McCain of Arizona, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Tennessee’s Bob Corker. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said Alexander has eight or nine Republican co-sponsors, and Democrats plan to provide an equal number to build bipartisan pressure.  Also behind the measure were America’s Health Insurance Plans, the giant trade group for insurers; AARP representing the elderly; the National Retail Federation, which lobbies for merchants plus doctors, hospitals and patients groups.  ___  AP Congressional Correspondent Erica Werner and reporters Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, Ken Thomas, Kevin Freking and Jill Colvin contributed.",3.25,8,"[4.0, 5.0, 0.5, 4.5, 4.5, 3.5, 1.5, 2.5]"
597,1993,10,13,2017,2017-10-13,Breitbart,Report: Jared Kushner ‘Enriched Himself’ After Failing to Disclose Business Ownership,"A House Judiciary Committee member is accusing White House Senior Adviser Jared Kushner of enriching himself by not revealing his stake in a real estate business on his financial disclosure forms — a move from which Kushner may have profited.  “It appears [Kushner] ended up being the beneficiary of that omission,” Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) told Newsweek. “He enriched himself by failing to disclose the asset.”  Kushner’s stake in the company, Cadre, was an “administrative error,” according to Kushner’s lawyer but Newsweek reports that it allowed Trump’s son-in-law to maintain a stake in a start-up as it attracted investors and doubled its venture funding.  Kushner submitted his financial disclosure form on March 9 to the Office of Government Ethics, with the company he co-founded with his brother Joshua and a Harvard classmate not specifically listed. Newsweek lays out how different Kushner’s disclosure was from how he eventually amended it:    Kushner’s lawyer says Cadre was not specifically cited on the March 9 form because his holding company, BFPS Ventures, acquired his interest in Cadre on February 17. That transaction appears to be noted on his financial records as a $100,000 to $250,000 sale. But that amount does not match subsequent disclosures. When Kushner finally amended his financial disclosure form on July 21, he valued his interest in Cadre from $5 million to $25 million.  The outlet reports that his failure to include the full value of Cadre in his filing may have allowed him to hold onto most of his interest rather than divest. Additionally, the company may not have been as attractive to investors attracted to the company’s White House ties.  Left-wing billionaire George Soros was one of the initial investors of the project, who reportedly opened up a $250 million line of credit between his offices and Cadre. But it raises the question as to whether a conflict of interest could have arisen. Representatives for Cadre told Newsweek Kushner has a “small, passive investment” in the company, but no operational or advisory role.    “You can have foreign governments or other individuals who have significant interests before Jared Kushner. This is the man responsible for Middle East peace talks and the American Innovation office, Virginia Canter, executive branch ethics counsel for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told Newsweek.  “The point is, Cadre could result in a benefit to him and there’s no way for us to have any insight or to hold him accountable,” she said, before adding that it points to a “systematic problem” considering Kushner’s previously reported problems with his security filings.

Four other families said they have not received a call and were upset. One said Trump had not called but that they knew the late soldier would not want his death politicized. An additional family said it had corresponded with the White House but declined to elaborate.”  This isn’t the only time Trump has claimed to have an excellent memory that conflicts with the facts.

Trump can expect a friendly reception in Japan, his first stop on a five-nation Asia trip that kicks off Sunday, Nov. 5, 2017. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File)  TOKYO (AP) — President Donald Trump can expect a friendly reception in Japan, his first stop on a five-nation Asia trip that kicks off Sunday.  He and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe largely see eye-to-eye on how to deal with the vexing problem of North Korea’s weapons development, even if a solution remains elusive. America’s trade deficit with Japan could be a point of contention, though Trump has aimed his recent rhetoric on trade at China, not Japan.  The two leaders will meet on the golf course Sunday before holding formal talks on Monday. A look at what’s on tap:  NORTH KOREA  North Korea’s rapid advances in missile development are making the potential threat much more real for both Japan and the United States. As it seeks to send missiles farther, North Korea has test-launched two over northern Japan and into the Pacific Ocean this year. While they were too high to be seen or heard on the ground, the Japanese government set off emergency sirens and warnings advising people to seek shelter. Abe has pushed for stronger U.N. sanctions on North Korea, and joined Trump in saying China should do more to pressure its neighbor. Trump and Abe are likely to agree that what is needed is more pressure, not dialogue, as they have in the past.  ___  TRADE  One of Trump’s first moves as president was to pull the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement that had been signed with 11 other countries after years of tough negotiations. While widely anticipated, it was a blow to Japan and the other TPP members. In line with Trump’s preference for country-to-country trade deals, Vice President Mike Pence and Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Taro Aso have been leading an “economic dialogue” aimed at forging closer ties. Japan’s trade surplus with the U.S. is much smaller than China’s, and Japanese automakers, especially, have sought to mute criticism by setting up shop in the U.S. and hiring American workers. But Trump has complained about a weakening of the yen over the past five years that has aided Japanese exporters and other corporations with significant business overseas.  ___  ABDUCTIONS  Trump’s address to the U.N. General Assembly in September, in which he warned the U.S. might have “to totally destroy North Korea,” got attention in Japan for another reason. “We know it kidnapped a sweet 13-year-old Japanese girl from a beach in her own country to enslave her as a language tutor for North Korea’s spies,” he said. In so doing, Trump touched on an issue that Abe has made a priority to resolve: the Japanese citizens who were abducted by North Korea in the 1970s and 1980s. Five returned in 2002, but the fate of the others remains unclear. Trump plans to meet with the relatives of some of the abductees while he is in Japan.  ___  FORE!  Golf diplomacy has become part of Japan’s playbook on Donald Trump. Abe made a stopover in New York soon after the U.S. presidential election last November and presented the then-president-elect with a pricey Japanese Honma driver. Trump reciprocated with a golf shirt and other golf-related goods. The two hit the links at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida after a summit meeting in Washington in February. They will be joined by top Japanese pro Hideki Matsuyama on Sunday at the Kasumigaseki Country Club outside of Tokyo. The prestigious club changed its policy to allow women to be full members in March after coming under pressure as the venue for golf at the Summer Olympics in Tokyo in 2020.

Wild turkeys have bounced back in New England in what's considered a success story for wildlife restoration. But as they spread farther into urban areas, they're increasingly coming into conflict with humans who say they ravage gardens, damage cars and attack people. (AP Photo/Collin Binkley)  BOSTON (AP) — Not everyone is celebrating the return of the wild turkeys.  After being wiped out from New England in the 1800s, the birds have stormed back in what’s considered a major success story for wildlife restoration. But as they spread farther into urban areas, they’re increasingly clashing with residents who say they destroy gardens, damage cars, chase pets and attack people.  Complaints about troublesome turkeys have surged in Boston and its suburbs over the past three years, causing headaches for police and health officials called to handle problems, according to city and town records provided to The Associated Press. It’s a familiar dilemma for some other U.S. towns from coast to coast that have been overrun by turkeys in recent years.  Boston city officials say they received at least 60 complaints last year, a threefold increase over the year before. Nearby Somerville, Belmont and Brookline have seen similar upticks, combining for a total of 137 turkey gripes since the start of last year.  “Several years ago it was more of an isolated situation here and there,” said David Scarpitti, the wild turkey and upland game biologist for the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife. “Now it’s starting to spread into communities all around Boston.”  Wild turkeys are increasingly clashing with their human neighbors as they spread out into urban areas. New England's turkey population has rebounded, but some residents complain that the birds ruin gardens, damage cars and even attack people. (Oct. 13)  Often the grievance is little more than a wayward turkey blocking traffic, but in at least five cases turkeys became so aggressive that police said they had to shoot them as a matter of public safety. Some area residents have suffered minor injuries from the birds, including a 72-year-old woman who told police she was bruised in August after a gang of turkeys scratched and pecked her during a walk.  Turkeys in the wild are far stronger and faster than the ones that land on Thanksgiving tables, experts say. Males in particular are driven to show physical aggression as a way to climb the social pecking order, and they sometimes view humans as potential competitors.  “Turkeys don’t really mean to harm people — it’s just tied to their social dynamics within the flock,” Scarpitti said. “They lose perspective that humans are humans and turkeys are turkeys. They just want to assert dominance over anything.”  Even the earliest Americans picked up on that characteristic, with Ben Franklin famously writing that the turkey is a “Bird of Courage, and would not hesitate to attack a Grenadier of the British Guards who should presume to invade his Farm Yard with a red Coat on.”  In the town of Brookline, Tess Bundy has come to loathe the turkeys that roost behind her home and often come charging when she leaves. She called police in April after a big tom repeatedly launched itself at her and her infant daughter, backing down only after Bundy whacked it several times with a shovel.  “They’re terrible. Every year they’re worse,” said Bundy, a history professor at Merrimack College. “I really do think that they’re a menace to the town.”  The complaints have sent some cities searching for answers, including in Cambridge, where the City Council says it’s working on a plan. Officials in Brookline issued new guidance for fowl encounters in August, telling residents to “step toward the turkey and act confidently.”  Wildlife experts say much of the problem can be blamed on residents who leave out food for turkeys, which entices flocks to settle in and helps them survive winters.  Towns with similar problems in New Jersey, Iowa and Oregon have banned turkey feeding in recent years, and Montana enacted a similar statewide ban in May. But the idea hasn’t spread to the Boston area, where some residents say they enjoy the return of native wildlife.  Not far from two sites where turkeys were shot by police, Brookline resident Suzette Abbott says she’s had no problems with the turkeys that roam her block.  “I don’t think they’re dangerous,” Abbott said. “In the spring they look pretty amazing when the males are displaying their colors. I think they’re quite beautiful if you actually look at their feathers.”  ___  Follow Collin Binkley on Twitter: @cbinkley.",3.7,5,"[4.0, 3.5, 5.0, 2.5, 3.5]"

TechCrunch reports that following a number of tweets from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey last week, in which he discussed more aggressive rule enforcement on Twitter’s platform, the company has announced a crackdown on hate and abuse on the social media network as part of a new update. A number of Dorsey’s tweets can be seen below.  1/ We see voices being silenced on Twitter every day. We’ve been working to counteract this for the past 2 years. — jack (@jack) October 14, 2017  2/ We prioritized this in 2016. We updated our policies and increased the size of our teams.

Speaking to TechCrunch a Twitter representative said, “Although we planned on sharing these updates later this week, we hope our approach and upcoming changes, as well as our collaboration with the Trust and Safety Council, show how seriously we are rethinking our rules and how quickly we’re moving to update our policies and how we enforce them.”  Twitter’s head of safety policy also outlined the company’s new tactics when dealing with abuse in an email to Twitter’s Trust and Safety Council. In the past, Twitter’s policies have not placed specific guidelines on how to deal with violent tweets or images, “hate symbols” have also not been clearly defined. The company still hasn’t specifically defined “hate symbols” but did say that, “at a high level, hateful imagery, hate symbols, etc will now be considered sensitive media.” This means that certain “hate symbols” will show a warning that users must click on to reveal the image.  With “violent groups” on their platform, Twitter, “will take enforcement action against organizations that use/have historically used violence as a means to advance their cause.” These violent groups have also not been defined by the company. Twitter already takes action against individuals or groups that promote or threaten violence but soon tweets that glorify violence will also be monitored. “Murdering makes sense. That way they won’t be a drain on social services,” the email states as an example.  Updates to policies relating to non-consensual nudity, such as revenge porn or creep-shots, have been clearly outlined, “We will immediately and permanently suspend any account we identify as the original poster/source of non-consensual nudity and/or if a user makes it clear they are intentionally posting said content to harass their target. We will do a full account review whenever we receive a Tweet-level report about non-consensual nudity. If the account appears to be dedicated to posting non-consensual nudity then we will suspend the entire account immediately.”  Unwanted sexual advances on the platform will also be subject to greater scrutiny, “We are going to update the Twitter Rules to make it clear that this type of behavior is unacceptable. We will continue taking enforcement action when we receive a report from someone directly involved in the conversation. Once our improvements to bystander reporting go live, we will also leverage past interaction signals (eg things like block, mute, etc) to help determine whether something may be unwanted and action the content accordingly.”  Twitter’s head of policy wrote in an email, “We realize that a more aggressive policy and enforcement approach will result in the removal of more content from our service. We are comfortable making this decision, assuming that we will only be removing abusive content that violates our Rules. To help ensure this is the case, our product and operational teams will be investing heavily in improving our appeals process and turnaround times for their reviews.”  The full email can be read below:  Dear Trust & Safety Council members, I’d like to follow up on Jack’s Friday night Tweetstorm about upcoming policy and enforcement changes. Some of these have already been discussed with you via previous conversations about the Twitter Rules update. Others are the result of internal conversations that we had throughout last week. Here’s some more information about the policies Jack mentioned as well as a few other updates that we’ll be rolling out in the weeks ahead. Non-consensual nudity Current approach We treat people who are the original, malicious posters of non-consensual nudity the same as we do people who may unknowingly Tweet the content. In both instances, people are required to delete the Tweet(s) in question and are temporarily locked out of their accounts. They are permanently suspended if they post non-consensual nudity again.  Updated approach We will immediately and permanently suspend any account we identify as the original poster/source of non-consensual nudity and/or if a user makes it clear they are intentionally posting said content to harass their target. We will do a full account review whenever we receive a Tweet-level report about non-consensual nudity. If the account appears to be dedicated to posting non-consensual nudity then we will suspend the entire account immediately. Our definition of “non-consensual nudity” is expanding to more broadly include content like upskirt imagery, “creep shots,” and hidden camera content. Given that people appearing in this content often do not know the material exists, we will not require a report from a target in order to remove it. While we recognize there’s an entire genre of pornography dedicated to this type of content, it’s nearly impossible for us to distinguish when this content may/may not have been produced and distributed consensually. We would rather error on the side of protecting victims and removing this type of content when we become aware of it.  Unwanted sexual advances Current approach Pornographic content is generally permitted on Twitter, and it’s challenging to know whether or not sexually charged conversations and/or the exchange of sexual media may be wanted. To help infer whether or not a conversation is consensual, we currently rely on and take enforcement action only if/when we receive a report from a participant in the conversation.  Updated approach We are going to update the Twitter Rules to make it clear that this type of behavior is unacceptable. We will continue taking enforcement action when we receive a report from someone directly involved in the conversation. Once our improvements to bystander reporting go live, we will also leverage past interaction signals (eg things like block, mute, etc) to help determine whether something may be unwanted and action the content accordingly.  Hate symbols and imagery (new) We are still defining the exact scope of what will be covered by this policy. At a high level, hateful imagery, hate symbols, etc will now be considered sensitive media(similar to how we handle and enforce adult content and graphic violence).  More details to come. Violent groups (new) We are still defining the exact scope of what will be covered by this policy. At a high level, we will take enforcement action against organizations that use/have historically used violence as a means to advance their cause.  More details to come here as well (including insight into the factors we will consider to identify such groups). Tweets that glorify violence (new) We already take enforcement action against direct violent threats (“I’m going to kill you”), vague violent threats (“Someone should kill you”) and wishes/hopes of serious physical harm, death, or disease (“I hope someone kills you”). Moving forward, we will also take action against content that glorifies (“Praise be to <terrorist name> for shooting up <event>. He’s a hero!”) and/or condones (“Murdering <x group of people> makes sense. That way they won’t be a drain on social services”).  More details to come. We realize that a more aggressive policy and enforcement approach will result in the removal of more content from our service. We are comfortable making this decision, assuming that we will only be removing abusive content that violates our Rules. To help ensure this is the case, our product and operational teams will be investing heavily in improving our appeals process and turnaround times for their reviews. In addition to launching new policies, updating enforcement processes and improving our appeals process, we have to do a better job explaining our policies and setting expectations for acceptable behavior on our service. In the coming weeks, we will be: updating the Twitter Rules as we previously discussed (+ adding in these new policies)  updating the Twitter media policy to explain what we consider to be adult content, graphic violence, and hate symbols.  launching a standalone Help Center page to explain the factors we consider when making enforcement decisions and describe our range of enforcement options  launching new policy-specific Help Center pages to describe each policy in greater detail, provide examples of what crosses the line, and set expectations for enforcement consequences  Updating outbound language to people who violate our policies (what we say when accounts are locked, suspended, appealed, etc). We have a lot of work ahead of us and will definitely be turning to you all for guidance in the weeks ahead. We will do our best to keep you looped in on our progress. All the best,  Head of Safety Policy",4.25,4,"[5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 4.5]"
1623,3378,11,13,2017,2017-11-13,Associated Press News,Trump does not publicly rebuke Duterte for drug war killings,"President Donald Trump speaks with Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte at an ASEAN Summit dinner at the SMX Convention Center, Sunday, Nov. 12, 2017, in Manila, Philippines. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)  MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has sanctioned a bloody drug war that features extrajudicial killing. He called Barack Obama a “son of a whore.” This week, he boasted that he murdered a man with his own hands.  All that went unmentioned in public by President Donald Trump when the leaders held talks Monday in the Philippines.  Reporters saw the beginning of the leaders’ bilateral meeting during which Trump praised Duterte’s hospitality, the organization of the summit he was hosting and even Manila’s weather. Trump said nothing about human rights and both leaders ignored shouted questions about the violent drug crackdown. The two men also shared a laugh in the meeting when Duterte called reporters “spies.”  Later, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that the 40-minute meeting focused on ISIS, illegal drugs, and trade. Human rights, she added, briefly came up in the context of the Philippines’ fight against illegal drugs. She did not say if Trump was critical of the violence.  That appeared to conflict with the Philippines’ version of the meeting. Harry Roque, a spokesman for Duterte, said “there was no mention of human rights. There was no mention of extralegal killings. There was only a rather lengthy discussion of the Philippine war on drugs with President Duterte doing most of the explaining.”  Breaking with his presidential predecessors, Trump has largely abandoned publicly pressing foreign leaders on human rights, instead showing a willingness to embrace international strongmen for strategic gain. He has cozied up to autocrats such as Saudi Arabia’s King Salman, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi and Russian President Vladimir Putin. And earlier in this trip to Asia he made no mention of human rights during multiple appearances in Beijing with Chinese President Xi Jinping.  “Trump seems very comfortable with strongmen. It’s not just that he won’t criticize Duterte. I wouldn’t be surprised if he patted him on the back,” said Mike Chinoy, senior fellow at U.S.-China Institute at the University of Southern California, before the meeting.  Duterte’s war on drugs has alarmed human rights advocates around the world who say it has allowed police officers and vigilantes to ignore due process and to take justice into their own hands. Government officials estimate that well over 3,000 people, mostly drug users and dealers, have died in the ongoing crackdown. Human rights groups believe the victim total is far higher, perhaps closer to 9,000.  “Human rights groups, I think, will be quite disappointed by the visit,” said Amy Searight, director of the Southeast Asia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “It’s unlikely that human rights or rule of law or due process are going to be topics that President Trump will raise.”  Duterte has strenuously defended the violence and boasted of participating himself.  Late last year, he bragged that he personally pulled the trigger and killed three people years ago while serving as mayor of Davao City. And last week, while in Vietnam for an international summit, he said he took his first life years earlier.  “When I was a teenager, I had been in and out of jail, rumble here and there,” Duterte said during a speech in Danang, where he briefly crossed paths with Trump on the sidelines of an international summit. “At the age of 16, I already killed someone.”  He claimed he fatally stabbed the person “just over a look.” His spokesman later tried to downplay the comment, saying, “I think it was in jest.”  Trump has shown little interest in pressuring Duterte to rein in the violence, instead saluting him during a May phone call.  “I just wanted to congratulate you because I am hearing of the unbelievable job on the drug problem,” Trump told Duterte, according to a transcript of the conversation that later leaked. “Many countries have the problem, we have a problem, but what a great job you are doing and I just wanted to call and tell you that.”  Trump also criticized Obama during the call, noting that his predecessor “did not understand” the drug problem the Philippines faces. Meanwhile, Duterte was openly critical of Obama in the final year of his presidency, including cursing his name.  White House officials have suggested there is a strategy behind Trump’s flattery of Duterte.  Advisers have said that while Trump was always unlikely to publicly chastise the Philippine president, he may offer criticisms behind closed doors. Trump would plan to hold his tongue in public in order not to embarrass Duterte, whom he is urging to help pressure North Korea and fight terrorism, and to avoid pushing him into the arms of China.  “If the administration is not going to care about human rights in China, why would you care in the Philippines?” asked Gordon Chang, Asia expert and author of “Nuclear Showdown: North Korea Takes On the World.” He said the “logical thing to do is keep them close and not let Duterte flirt with China. In our struggle with China, we need all the friends when we can get.”  Duterte has seemed less committed to the strategic partnership with the U.S. Searight said a good relationship is “vital to the United States given its location on the South China Sea and the enhanced access that the American military has gotten in recent years with the Philippines.”  White House aides have suggested that Trump’s strategy has worked before, pointing to his interactions with el-Sissi. Trump refrained from chastising the Egyptian leader but quietly worked with him to help engineer the release of American prisoner Aya Hijazi in April.  Trump dismissed the notion that he buddied up to dictators. He said Saturday he has great relationships with all sorts of leaders, “every person in that room today,” after leaving a summit in Vietnam attended by Duterte and Putin, among others.  Human rights groups have expressed dismay at Trump’s public silence, believing that the spotlight an American president can shine on human rights abuses overseas can rally pressure on an authoritarian regime to change its ways.  “In the old days, we used to call on the U.S. government to raise human rights issues during these trips,” said John Sifton, Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch. But given the administration’s lack of credibility in raising human rights abuses, he said, they have pivoted to a different tack, focusing on international attention.  “We haven’t given up,” Sifton said.  ___  Associated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report.  ___  Follow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire",4.625,4,"[5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.5]"
960,2476,10,23,2017,2017-10-23,Associated Press News,"Kelly on O’Reilly: Abuse, shaming of women has to stop"," Megyn Kelly poses on the set of her new show, ""Megyn Kelly Today"" at NBC Studios on Thursday, Sept, 21, 2017, in New York. Kelly says she complained to her bosses about Bill O'Reilly's behavior after she had accused former Fox chief Roger Ailes of sexual harassment, and that the abuse and shaming of women has to stop. Kelly, now with her own show on NBC, spoke Monday, Oct. 24, 2017, after it was revealed in The New York Times that Fox paid a $32 million settlement to former Fox analyst Lis Wiehl shortly before his contract was renewed. O'Reilly was fired in April. (Photo by Charles Sykes/Invision/AP, File)  NEW YORK (AP) — Megyn Kelly took on her former Fox News Channel colleague Bill O’Reilly in blunt terms on Monday, revealing she had gone to her bosses to complain about O’Reilly’s behavior and saying the size of a newly revealed $32 million settlement of harassment charges made by a Fox analyst was “jaw-dropping.”  O’Reilly responded, in part, by posting a copy of a thank you note Kelly had sent to him for a gift given at a baby shower.  The New York Times reported that O’Reilly had agreed to the $32 million deal to set aside allegations that include a nonconsensual sexual relationship with former Fox analyst Lis Wiehl, bringing to six the number of harassment settlements involving him. The deal was reached a month before O’Reilly signed a contract extension and three months before O’Reilly was fired because of publicity about the cases against him. O’Reilly has said he’s done nothing wrong.  More than just an embarrassment that Fox had hoped was in its rear-view mirror, the story could have costly consequences. Fox’s parent company, 21st Century Fox, is awaiting a decision by British regulators regarding its purchase of the Sky satellite television company, and the issue of Fox News’ management is being considered.  Kelly, on her NBC show Monday, refuted O’Reilly’s claims that no one had complained about him, saying Fox “was not exactly a friendly environment” for women who had stories to tell about abuse.  She said she went to Fox leaders Bill Shine, who has since resigned, and Jack Abernethy, who is now president of Fox News Network, after her memoir was published last November with her anger about O’Reilly’s suggestion that people who complained about their treatment at Fox were disloyal. Kelly had written in her book about alleged harassment by Fox’s one-time leader Roger Ailes.  “Perhaps he didn’t realize the kind of message his criticism sends to young women across the country about how men continue to view the issue of speaking out about sexual harassment,” Kelly said she wrote to her bosses.  O’Reilly’s attitude of “shaming women into shutting the hell up about harassment on the grounds that it will disgrace the company” is precisely how Fox got into the mess it was in, she said. Later Monday, she posted a copy of the email she sent to her bosses. “You’ve got a hell of a guy hosting that 8 p.m. hour,” she wrote.  Kelly said she was told O’Reilly would be spoken to and, hours later, he said on the air that people who don’t like what is happening in the workplace should leave or go to human resources. She said it’s clearly not just Fox that handles the issue of harassment badly.  “This must stop,” she said. “The abuse of women, the shaming of them, the threats, the retaliation, the silence of them after the fact — it has to stop.”  O’Reilly and Kelly’s shows once ran back-to-back on Fox’s prime lineup. Now those time slots are filled by Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity. O’Reilly, speaking Monday on the radio program hosted by another ex-Fox colleague, Glenn Beck, said he found Kelly’s comment incomprehensible.  “I don’t know why Megyn Kelly is doing what she’s doing,” he said. “I helped her dramatically in her career.”  His website posted notes penned to O’Reilly by Kelly in 2009 and 2012. In one, she thanks O’Reilly for publicizing a book written by her husband. In the other, she thanks him for the “darling body suit and snuggly” given at a baby shower. “You’ve become a dear friend (no matter what you say) and I’m grateful to have you in my life,” she wrote in the note.  O’Reilly also posted a note from Gretchen Carlson, whose lawsuit against Ailes led to his downfall. She’s been critical of O’Reilly, and of Fox allowing Hannity to bring him back on the air for an interview recently. In the undated note to O’Reilly, she wrote, “thank you for being my friend.”  Carlson’s response on Twitter to the note: “So what. Still paid $32M.”  “If you still want to think I’m a bad guy, go ahead,” O’Reilly told Beck. He said the Times’ story about the Wiehl case was designed to get keep him out of the marketplace.  “This is an attack on an American citizen, me, for political purposes,” he said. “It has done enormous damage to me and my family. It is a horror show and should never happen in this country.”  On her show, Kelly said she’s still being victimized by Fox. She said Fox’s powerful public relations chief Irena Briganti is “known for her vindictiveness” and “to this day, she pushes negative articles on certain Ailes accusers, like the one you are looking at right now.”  Briganti was not at work Monday. 21st Century Fox issued a statement saying Briganti was “a valued colleague and she has our full support.”  Kelly also interviewed former Fox anchor Juliet Huddy on her show. Huddy, who appeared with her lawyer Doug Wigdor, also settled harassment claims against O’Reilly, and said she wrestled with the idea of signing non-disclosure agreements. The one she signed prevented Huddy from giving any details about her case against O’Reilly. She said she struggled with the concept, knowing that it would help other women who feel abused if they knew there were others out there like them.  Huddy said she still isn’t working in the broadcast business after leaving Fox.",3.1560283687943262,282,"[1.5, 3.5, 1.5, 3.5, 2.0, 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 4.5, 4.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 4.5, 2.5, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.0, 2.5, 5.0, 2.5, 2.5, 1.5, 2.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.0, 2.5, 4.5, 1.5, 4.0, 2.5, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 1.5, 0.5, 4.5, 4.0, 5.0, 3.0, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5, 5.0, 2.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 2.5, 0.5, 0.5, 4.5, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0, 3.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.5, 4.5, 2.0, 4.0, 2.5, 5.0, 1.0, 4.0, 3.5, 4.5, 3.0, 3.5, 3.0, 2.5, 5.0, 3.0, 3.0, 4.5, 4.0, 0.5, 1.5, 3.0, 1.5, 5.0, 3.5, 2.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.0, 1.0, 3.0, 1.0, 1.5, 3.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 1.5, 4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 3.5, 0.5, 3.5, 3.0, 3.5, 2.5, 5.0, 3.0, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.0, 2.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 1.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 2.0, 3.5, 4.5, 0.5, 4.0, 1.5, 5.0, 5.0, 3.5, 5.0, 4.0, 2.5, 4.5, 4.5, 2.5, 4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.5, 1.0, 3.0, 3.5, 0.5, 2.0, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.0, 0.5, 0.5, 3.5, 4.5, 0.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.0, 2.5, 5.0, 1.5, 3.0, 5.0, 3.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.0, 1.0, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 0.5, 2.5, 0.5, 4.0, 1.5, 4.5, 2.5, 5.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0, 3.0, 4.0, 4.0, 2.5, 3.5, 0.5, 4.5, 0.5, 4.5, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 0.5, 5.0, 2.5, 3.0, 5.0, 3.5, 2.5, 4.5, 1.5, 3.5, 4.0, 2.5, 2.5, 1.5, 2.5, 4.5, 2.5, 4.0, 2.5, 2.0, 3.5, 5.0, 1.5, 2.5, 2.5, 3.5, 3.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.0, 2.0, 3.0, 1.0, 4.5, 3.0, 5.0, 0.5, 2.0, 0.5, 4.5, 2.0, 3.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 1.0, 5.0, 0.5, 4.0, 4.5, 0.5, 4.5, 0.5, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 3.0, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 2.0, 5.0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 3.0]"
141,857,9,13,2017,2017-09-13,Fox News,US producer prices rose in August as energy costs shot up,"Higher energy costs led to prices at the wholesale level rising in August at the fastest pace in four months.  The Labor Department said Wednesday that its producer price index, which measures inflation pressures before they reach the consumer, rose 0.2 percent last month. It was the largest monthly increase since a 0.5 percent gain in April. Inflationary pressures have largely been subdued in recent months. Much of the increase in August came from a 3.3 percent surge in energy costs. Food expenses slipped in August, including a sharp 20.6 percent decline in wheat prices.  The survey was taken before Harvey and Irma struck the southern part of the United States, events that will likely cause prices to further rise in the coming months as the rebuilding process begins. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said he is ""braced"" for a temporary ""spike"" in producer prices because of the hurricanes.  Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, rose 0.1 percent last month. Over the past 12 months, wholesale prices are up a moderate 2.4 percent while core prices have risen 2.0 percent.  Despite the monthly increase, relatively low inflation has been a constant throughout the recovery from the Great Recession will continue. For the past five years, inflation has stayed below the Federal Reserve's target of annual price gains of 2 percent. The Fed's preferred measure of core inflation for consumers has risen just 1.4 percent over the past 12 months.  For producers, food expenses slipped in August. This included a sharp 20.6 percent decline in wheat prices, the biggest decline since April 2008. Producer costs for plastics, investment advice and airline passengers also fell in August.  Prices for iron and steel scrap rose in August as did the costs for industrial chemicals.  The Fed is closely monitoring inflation to determine whether to raise a key short-term interest rate.  The U.S. central bank raised the rate in March and June from relatively low levels. Many investors and analysts believe it could hike the rate against at a December meeting, but that depends in large part on whether inflation appears to be headed toward staying consistently at 2 percent.",2.25,2,"[2.0, 2.5]"

Some in the military community are furious that Trump has drawn John Kelly’s family tragedy into a political brawl. Trump this week suggested that President Barack Obama did not properly console Kelly’s family when his son, Robert, was killed in Afghanistan in 2010. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Enraged and rattled by the political brawl over military mourning, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly returned this week to the one place he could go clear his head — Section 60 of Arlington National Cemetery, some of the saddest ground in America. There, amid the memorials to the recent war dead is Grave 9480, the final resting place of Kelly’s son, Robert, a Marine killed in 2010 in Afghanistan.  “The only thing I could do to collect my thoughts was to go and walk among the finest men and women on this Earth,” Kelly told reporters Thursday, as he mounted a vigorous defense of President Donald Trump’s handling of the “sacred” job of consoling families of fallen soldiers.  Kelly’s remarks invoking his son and his personal grief was a startling shift for the reserved, retired Marine general who has largely recoiled at injecting his family’s loss into the political arena. Since the younger Kelly was killed by a land mine in remote Helmand province, his father has labored to keep Robert’s death out of the spotlight — no easy task as the highest ranking military official to lose a child in the wars. Kelly only occasionally references his son in remarks, often growing emotional as he recounts the heartbreaking events or is asked to describe Robert.  “Finest man I ever knew,” Kelly said on Fox & Friends in May.  On Memorial Day, he and Trump visited Robert’s grave at Arlington.  “We grieve with you. We honor you. And we pledge to you that we will always remember Robert and what he did for all of us,” Trump said, singling out the Kelly family during his remarks to the nation that day. Turning to Robert’s father, then the secretary of homeland security, Trump added, “Thank you, John.”  But Trump this week pushed Kelly into new terrain.  Seeking to defend his record of outreach to Gold Star families, Trump suggested former President Barack Obama should have called Kelly after Robert’s death but didn’t.  “You could ask Gen. Kelly, did he get a call from Obama?” Trump said in an interview on Fox News Radio.  Trump’s willingness to raise the tragedy set many in the military community seething.  “If there is one sacred ground in politics it should be the ultimate sacrifices made by our military,” wrote Chuck Hagel, a defense secretary under Obama and before that, a Republican U.S. senator. In an email to The Associated Press, Hagel added: “To use General Kelly and his family in this disgusting political way is sickening and beneath every shred of decency of presidential leadership.”  “I would be surprised if he comes in and starts allowing people to use his family as a tool,” said Charles C. Krulak, a former Marine Corps commandant who has known John Kelly since the mid-1990s.  The public controversy this week clearly was painful for Kelly, whose son had been awarded the Purple Heart. Kelly knew in 2010 that his son was patrolling with his men through mine-filled battlefields and had just days earlier warned the family of the potential danger, according to a report in The Washington Post. When Gen. Joseph Dunford Jr. rang the elder Kelly’s doorbell at 6:10 a.m. on November 9, 2010, John Kelly knew Robert was dead. Dunford, Kelly told reporters Thursday, said Robert “was where he wanted to be exactly, what he wanted to be with exactly the people he wanted to be with.”  “Hours after my son was killed his friends were calling us from Afghanistan telling us how great a guy he was. Those are the only phone calls that really matter,” Kelly said Thursday. But, he allowed, there’s “not really much that can take the edge off” such a loss.  In March 2011, Kelly accompanied his boss, Defense Secretary Bob Gates, on a visit to the Sangin district, in Helmand province — the scene of some of the most intense fighting of the war and where Robert Kelly had been killed.  As Gates’ senior military assistant, Kelly stood silently among young Marines gathering under a harsh sun as Gates applauded what they had accomplished.  “Your success, obviously, has come at an extraordinary price,” Gates said without mentioning names.  Asked to elaborate on Robert in the Fox interview, Kelly hesitated at first — then it came tumbling out.  “Finest guy. Wonderful guy. Wonderful husband, wonderful son, wonderful brother. Brave beyond all get out. His men still correspond with us. They still mourn him as we do.”  ___  Follow Kellman and Burns on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/APLaurieKellman and http://www.twitter.com/RobertBurnsAP .  ___  Associated Press writer Rhonda Shafner contributed to this report.",3.097560975609756,41,"[4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 2.5, 5.0, 3.0, 4.5, 2.0, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0, 1.5, 3.0, 3.0, 2.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 3.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 3.5, 2.5, 2.0, 0.5, 4.5, 4.5, 2.5, 0.5, 3.5, 5.0, 0.5, 0.5, 3.0, 3.0, 4.5, 2.5]"

In 2004, Bill Gates said “two years from now, spam will be solved.” That never happened. And while the spam rate saw a steady decline after 2011, there has been an recent uptick as the maliciousness of spam has increased.  In the first half of 2017, the spam rate reached 54 percent, after bottoming out at 53 percent for both 2015 and 2016 with “all signs point to a continuation of this upward trajectory,” software security giant Symantec said in an October 2017 internet security report.    5 PHISHING SCAMS YOU NEED TO BE AWARE OF  The report cites email as the most frequently used delivery mechanism for malware. “No other distribution channel comes close,” Symantec said. “The attackers just fire off a spam message to a target...and that’s it—no need to rely on indirect methods where the target might or might not visit a compromised site or click a malicious banner ad.""  “It is a direct channel to an end user...[and] can cut a large swath through a variety of network security layers,"" Symantec added. Malicious spam can also often result in ransomware, a Symantec spokesperson told Fox News.  Enter infamous spambots  Lately, the operative word is ""malicious"" for spam arriving in your inbox.  ""A lot of spam is aimed at dropping malware on your machine,"" Jonathan Penn, Director of Strategy internet security firm Avast, which offers products such as Avast Internet Security, told Fox News.  ""That malware is often a botnet, and botnets are especially stealthy since their value is directly tied to how long they can remain undetected,"" Penn added.  The most widely used method to distribute malicious email is spambots, which is often part of a larger botnet – a bunch of Internet-connected devices running bots – and is “one of many tasks that the particular botnet carries out,” according to the Symantec report.  The Onliner spambot, which bypassed email filters to make it appear as though the emails were coming from legitimate sources, got a lot of attention this past summer because it inadvertently exposed its own email spamming list that included 711 million addresses.

President Donald Trump and Republican leaders are promoting their tax-cutting plan as needed relief for the stressed American middle class and a catalyst for job creation. Democrats say they're the ones looking out for the middle class, by fighting against proposed tax cuts that would benefit big corporations and the wealthy but hurt the average American. But what exactly defines this middle class, championed and courted for its votes by both sides? Lawmakers and experts have differing views on the numbers. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)  WASHINGTON (AP) — What is middle class?  President Donald Trump and Republican leaders are promoting their tax-cutting plan as needed relief for the stressed American middle class and a catalyst for job creation.  Democrats say they’re the ones looking out for the middle class, by fighting against proposed tax cuts that would benefit big companies and the wealthy but hurt the average American. It’s not easy to exactly define this middle class, whose members are championed and courted for their votes by both sides. Lawmakers and experts have differing views on the numbers.  The Tax Policy Center sets its “middle quintile” — third slice of five — of household income, including tax-exempt employee benefits like health insurance, at $48,300 to $85,600 a year. But be careful about calling that middle class, it says — there’s no formal definition.  Other experts see the middle-income range at around $44,000 to $72,000 (middle quintile), or $72,000 to $112,000 (fourth quintile, both based on 2015 data).  At the high end, Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama, as candidates, defined middle class as earning up to $250,000 a year. That raised eyebrows because it’s in about the top 5 percent of incomes, and the two Democrats had pledged not to raise taxes on the middle class.  The House narrowly passed a GOP budget on Thursday. Speaker Paul Ryan expressed enthusiasm, while Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said it was ""drawing a line in the sand"" between the middle class and extremely wealthy. (Oct. 26)  The median, or midpoint, U.S. household income was $57,617 last year, according to the Census Bureau.  Trump, in his rallying pitches for the far-reaching tax overhaul that is his main legislative priority, sounds the theme constantly. “We will cut taxes for hard-working, middle-class families,” he pledges. “It is time to ignite America’s middle-class miracle once again.”  To fill middle-class stockpots, Trump is promising that the tax cuts would bring a $4,000 or $5,000 pay raise annually for the average family. Skeptical tax experts and Democrats say the claim is based on fuzzy math.  Pro-tax cut troops have fanned out to middle-class neighborhoods around the country with a message to voters on their doorsteps: slashing taxes for corporations would unleash an economic bonanza. The resulting new jobs, faster growth and ample pay raises would help them and everyone else, the residents are told.  “That sort of trickle-down ... is a very hard message,” says James Thurber, professor and founder of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University. “Because of the burden of governing, they (the Republicans) have a problem having an effective messaging system.”  For the opposition Democrats, on the other hand, “It’s easier to have a clear message here that the tax plan would hurt the middle class and the working class,” Thurber suggested.  The nearly $6 trillion tax plan calls for cutting the corporate tax rate from 36 percent to 20 percent, reduced taxes for most individuals, and doubling the standard deduction used by most average Americans to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for families. The number of tax brackets would shrink from seven to three or four, with respective tax rates of 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent and to be determined. Inheritance taxes on multimillion-dollar estates would be repealed.  The middle-class family could take advantage of a heftier child tax credit and the extra money that could come from the bigger standard deduction.  But there are too many holes in the spare nine-page plan, like the income levels tied to each tax bracket and what might happen to other deductions used by middle-class people, to know how it actually would affect individual taxpayers and families.  A chief architect of the plan, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Kevin Brady, was pressed by reporters this past week: Will it truly help the middle class? Can the Republicans guarantee that everyone will get a break, that no ordinary person will end up paying more?  “The elevator goes down at every (income) level. ... I can guarantee that every American will be better off,” said Brady, R-Texas. He acknowledged, though, “It could be that a singular exception exists.”  But mainly Brady’s answer was stay tuned: The proposed income levels to correspond with each tax bracket will soon be revealed.  That’s where the math comes in. Under the current regime of seven brackets, the biggest group of U.S. taxpayers (about 30 percent) falls in the second-lowest bracket, paying a 15 percent tax rate. An individual with taxable annual income between $9,325 and $37,950 is in that group. Because it’s the largest group, some might consider it as standing in for the middle class.  Some critics of the Republican plan say that because it would eliminate the 15 percent bracket, some people who’ve been taxed at 15 percent could be pushed into the next higher bracket, 25 percent.  That’s not yet known, says Daniel Berger, a research associate at the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution. It totally depends on where the plan masters set the income levels.  “It’s theoretically possible that everyone in the 15 percent bracket would go to the lower bracket, the higher bracket, or they would split between the two,” Berger said.  Jared Walczak, a senior policy analyst at the conservative Tax Foundation, notes that an earlier Republican plan floated last year set the 25 percent tax rate for the same income level as currently, $37,950 to $91,900. If the new plan kept that income range unchanged or raised the bottom amount for the 25 percent rate, no one now paying 15 percent would be pushed into a higher rate, Walczak said.",3.236842105263158,76,"[3.0, 4.0, 2.5, 2.5, 2.0, 4.0, 0.5, 4.5, 1.0, 3.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.5, 4.0, 4.5, 2.5, 1.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 3.0, 2.0, 3.5, 2.5, 0.5, 5.0, 4.5, 5.0, 0.5, 3.5, 2.5, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 1.5, 4.0, 2.5, 4.5, 2.5, 0.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.0, 0.5, 2.0, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 1.0, 4.5, 2.5, 3.5, 2.5, 4.5, 3.0, 3.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.0, 3.0, 4.0]"

Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, walks to a closed-door security briefing at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, Oct. 25, 2017. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)  PHOENIX (AP) — U.S. Sen. Jeff Flake’s decision to bow out of a re-election fight could spur a rush of other Republican candidates who hope to take on his only announced challenger in the Arizona primary next year.  The freshman senator’s decision came after months of saying he expected a tough primary and general election but believed he could win. Behind the scenes, though, a drumbeat of polling showed him badly damaged by comments he made about President Donald Trump in a book released over the summer and an ongoing battle with his party’s leader that began before last year’s election.  Flake faced a challenge from former state Sen. Kelli Ward, who failed in her effort to beat Sen. John McCain last year but has gained traction this year. Former Trump strategist Steve Bannon attended a fundraiser last week for Ward, who has embraced the anti-establishment, anti-incumbent wing of the party driven by Trump with help from Bannon.  But mainstream Republicans in Arizona believe Ward cannot beat U.S. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, a moderate Democrat who is the only well-known candidate running from her party. They have been searching for another GOP candidate who can draw support from Trump populists, and Flake’s decision to step aside opens the door. In the background, the White House also has been seeking another candidate.  Flake’s departure has further raised the stakes for what is sure to be a bitter and expensive election battle next year in Arizona as the GOP fights to hold on to a seat and the Democrats seek an opening to pick one up.  Ward discounts talk that she’s unelectable, saying people are rallying behind her.  “The people who are dismissive, some of them have sour grapes because they didn’t get in at the right time to be able to build the organization that I’ve built,” she said before Flake’s announcement.  Despite the party turmoil, Ward and other potential Republican candidates benefit from Arizona’s conservatism. Democrats in recent elections have hoped to make inroads, most recently when Hillary Clinton poured money and resources into the state last year only to lose by 4 percentage points. Republicans also hold every statewide office and a majority in the Legislature.  Trump boasted Wednesday of his popularity in Arizona as he ridiculed Flake.  “So, look, (Flake’s) poll numbers are terrible,” Trump said. “He’s done terribly for the great people of Arizona, a state that likes Donald Trump very much as even you will admit. And he would have never won. In fact, even in the primary, he’s way down in the primary.”  The names of other potential GOP challengers in the Senate race have been floated for months, but none has entered the race. They include state university regent Jay Heiler; former state GOP chairman Robert Graham; state Treasurer and 2016 Trump campaign chief operating officer Jeff DeWit; and Reps. Paul Gosar and Trent Franks.  The other three GOP members of Arizona’s House delegation could be wild cards — David Schweikert, Andy Biggs and Martha McSally.  A spokesman for Republican Gov. Doug Ducey said he was “absolutely not” considering running for Senate.  Republican political consultants in Arizona are split on whether there will truly be a flood of candidates.  “Somehow they all seem unlikely to me,” Constantin Querard, a top campaign consultant, said of those already in the mix. “Because if you were not going to run against a mortally wounded candidate with the support of the president and millions of dollars of outside spending, why would you suddenly be interested in the race without all of those things?”  Another longtime Republican campaign consultant, who conducted polling showing Flake in bad trouble, isn’t so sure. Chuck Coughlin said a candidate who can draw support from the pillars of the GOP establishment in Arizona — Flake, McCain, Ducey and former Gov. Jan Brewer — would be the one to take on Ward.  “The question is, who can most closely thread the needle there between Trump, McCain, Flake, Brewer, the current governor,” Coughlin said. “Who is that?”  “One thing I’d guarantee you is Kelli Ward will face a primary opponent, there’s no doubt in my mind on that,” he added.  Another potential problem for Arizona Republicans is the health of McCain, who was diagnosed this summer with an aggressive form of brain cancer and acknowledges his prognosis is poor. A vacancy in McCain’s seat before April means a second Senate race would be on the 2018 ballot.  Flake told The Associated Press as recently this month that he was in the race to win and discounted both Ward and Sinema.  By Tuesday, things were different for Flake.  “If I could run the kind of race I’d like to run and believe I could win a Republican primary, I might go forward,” he told reporters at the U.S. Capitol after his announcement. “These days, it seems that unless you’re on every policy the president has, then somehow you’re not a conservative.”  Flake is a throwback Arizona conservative, with strong small government credentials but a libertarian streak along the lines of the late Sen. Barry Goldwater. He sparred with the president over free trade, which he supports, immigration reform and opening relations with Cuba.  Those positions put him in the crosshairs of Trump and the grass-roots populists he courts.  ___  This story has been corrected to show that Rep.

(AP Photo/Chris O'Meara)  TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — For nearly half her life, Ruby Williams has prayed for her daughter, Brenda: “Lord, let her be alive.”  She’s repeated this prayer tens of thousands of times, starting in the mid-1970s, when she lived in a four-bedroom apartment with her husband and 12 children. Now 89 and a widow, she prays in a modest home near downtown Tampa, where she lives with two of her children.  Brenda, Williams’ third child, has been missing since 1978. Since then, her family has subsisted on slender threads of hope: Maybe Brenda just walked away. Maybe she was living a new life, with a different family. Maybe she’d had a mental break and ended up in some faraway city, confused and living on the streets.  Nearly 40 years later, on a blazingly hot Florida day in August, the Williams family was summoned to the Tampa Police Department.  “It must be news about Brenda,” Williams thought. But she did not accompany two of Brenda’s sisters to the police department. Instead, she stayed home in her darkened living room to pray once more: “Lord, let her be alive.”  Sheila Williams, who idolized her older, glamorous sister, and Sharon Scott, who has searched for leads on Brenda’s disappearance for decades, came to their mother’s home hours later to deliver the news.  Brenda Williams’ family always prayed they would find her alive. But forensics did not bring a happy ending to their 40-year mystery. (Oct. 9)  Ruby Williams clasped her hands tight in her lap. Her children and grandchildren surrounded her. Most everyone sniffled and wiped away tears. They waited for Sharon and Sheila to begin speaking.  “Lord, let her be alive.”  ___  The police had given up, if they’d ever even been interested in the case — at least that’s how it seemed to Sharon Scott.  But her sister prodded her: “Let’s go!”  Sheila Williams loves watching the news, and a local segment had caught her attention: Law enforcement and other officials would soon gather for a symposium on cold cases. Maybe, she thought, they’d be able to talk with detectives there about Brenda.  Scott wasn’t convinced, but her baby sister won out. They dug up a faded, photocopied picture of Brenda they hoped to show police.  Once there, however, it became clear the event wasn’t open to the public. They stood out — they were among the only black women there.  Sheila took deep breaths and ran her fingers over the photo. All around them were detectives, forensic scientists, state attorneys, lawyers — and lifelike sculpted busts of the missing and the dead, carved to draw attention to 19 cold cases .  As speeches about Florida’s backlog of 20,000-plus cold cases began, a bust caught Sheila’s eye: an African-American woman with a short afro and big, haunted eyes. It kind of looked like her — and like Brenda.  Sheila gasped and glanced at the photo in her hands. She elbowed her sister, then nudged a police officer next to her.  “Don’t they look the same?” She pointed at the photo, then the bust.  The officer shushed her.  Sheila couldn’t help herself. She walked to the clay sculpture. She held the photo next to the face. Sharon glanced from her sister, to the photo, to the bust and back again. Sheila began to sob.  A detective stepped forward and ushered the women into a room. He swabbed their cheeks for DNA. Perhaps, detectives said, there would be a match. The woman’s body had been found in a patch of scrub brush used as an unauthorized trash dump in 1985 just outside downtown Tampa. Detectives didn’t know her name.  Could it be Brenda?  ___  Brenda grew up in the family’s crowded, chaotic apartment in a Tampa housing project and at 15, gave birth to a baby girl. That didn’t stop her from, as her sisters said, “being wild.”  She had minor brushes with the law and was incarcerated for a spell. When released, she got pregnant again, and at 22, had another girl. But to her family, she was getting her act together. She rented her own apartment a few streets away. Her mom proudly told neighbors that Brenda was finally going to church.  Sheila looked up to Brenda. Perhaps it had something to do with their birthdays — Brenda was born Feb. 1, 1955; Sheila, nine years and 364 days later. Or maybe it was how Brenda loved high heels, listened to The Isley Brothers and became the first Williams girl to drive.  By the time Sheila was 11, she was eager to spend the night at Brenda’s to get away from the chaos at home. But things weren’t always calm at Brenda’s, either. She dated a man who could be violent. When Sheila saw him beating her sister, she ran home to tell the rest of the family so they could defend her.  In April 1978, 22-year-old Brenda headed out for the night. Sheila cared for Brenda’s daughters, then 7 years and 9 months old.  “Don’t open this door for anyone,” Sheila remembers Brenda saying as she swept out of the house in her signature heels.  Brenda met up with Susanie “Cookie” Austin at a party. Austin remembers Brenda bursting in and asking if she wanted to go out on the town.  “I said no,” said Austin, now 61. “I never saw who she was with.”  Austin said she didn’t give much thought to Brenda’s question — the pair went drinking and dancing on occasion — until days later, when Brenda’s daughter knocked on the door.  “Have you seen my mama?” the girl asked.  A chill went through her. Brenda hadn’t come home? “It disturbed me so bad,” Austin said.  Everyone figured Brenda was just in trouble again, but within a day, the family started to worry. They checked everywhere. She wasn’t in jail and hadn’t been arrested. The family recalls calling police but says officers told them that because Brenda was an adult, there wasn’t much they could do unless relatives had evidence she’d been harmed.  Over the next few months, neighbors and friends stopped by the family’s apartment. They’d heard Brenda was in Bradenton. Someone claimed to have spotted her in Sarasota. Perhaps an ex-boyfriend had something to do with her disappearance.  Brenda had seemingly vanished into the humid Tampa air.  ___  Over the years, Sharon had done her own detective work. She knocked on the door of a Fort Lauderdale woman who shares her sister’s name, combed through articles at the library, looked into a tip that Brenda was at a mental health hospital, called detectives every year. She even found a woman in Tampa using her sister’s name and Social Security number.  And yet, Sharon got nowhere.  That never surprised Sheila.  “My sister was black. My sister was in and out of jail. My sister took drugs. Now that I’ve grown up and I’ve lived life and I see how they treat skin color, and we were poor, it didn’t make a difference,” she said recently in her apartment in a different housing project, not far from where she and her siblings were raised. “Brenda was a nobody to them.”  She paused and looked down. “Skin color makes a big difference. I feel like when skin is as dark as ours, things don’t matter. If you’re poor, people don’t listen.” (Tampa police say they have no record of Brenda Williams reported as a missing person in the 1970s but that they would have handled it with care as in any other such case.)  Months after the sisters gave DNA samples, Sheila was still convinced that Brenda was the woman from the sculpted bust — a woman who, they would learn, had been buried in a pauper’s grave in a cemetery a stone’s throw away, the one shaded by moss-draped oaks where their father and grandmother are buried, the one filled with names familiar across the city’s black community.  Sharon still wasn’t so sure.  “Every time I go out of town, I’m looking,” she said. “I’m looking at faces. I’ll stare at somebody who resembles my sister. When I see homeless people, I’ll look, and think, ‘That could be my sister.’”  The first time detectives called the family, about a month after the Tampa event, Sheila learned her feeling had been wrong; it wasn’t Brenda. Police still couldn’t identify the woman from the pauper’s grave, but the DNA tests ruled Brenda out.  After all that — seeing the bust that looked so much like Brenda, giving DNA samples, rehashing the case to reporters — the family was no closer to the truth. Once again, they thought, officials had given up.  But months later, in August, detectives called again.  “We have some findings,” they said. Cryptic, the sisters thought, but they rushed to the police department. It clearly was important — the chief was there. So was the forensic scientist who had exhumed the body they initially thought was Brenda’s.  The detectives talked about the science behind DNA and cold cases while the sisters wondered: What’s taking so long? Why are we here?  Then, the news: The sisters’ DNA was a match with a jawbone found in a Tampa field by a schoolboy in 1986.  After 40 years, Brenda Williams had been found.  ___  “Lord, let her be alive.”  The prayer Ruby Williams had relied on through the years still ran through her mind hours after the meeting, as children and grandchildren with long faces and wet tears filtered in and out of her home.  Brenda’s two daughters were there, now grown women, stunned.  It was a lot to take in, after decades of silence. Police said they don’t know how Brenda died. All they had is the jawbone, which they released to the family. Brenda’s loved ones used it to hold a proper funeral service Sept. 10, even as Hurricane Irma threatened the state.  Brenda had waited 40 years, and they wouldn’t let her wait any longer.  ___  Follow Tamara Lush on Twitter at http://twitter.com/tamaralush .",4.111111111111111,9,"[4.5, 4.0, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0]"

1122,2701,10,28,2017,2017-10-28,Vox,First charges filed in probe of Trump-Russia collusion: what we know and don’t know,"A federal grand jury has approved the first criminal charges in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of the Trump presidential campaign and its ties to Russia, a monumental step in the probe that has loomed over so much of President Donald Trump’s first year in office.  CNN first reported the news late Friday night. Reuters and the Wall Street Journal have now also reported that charges have been filed.  The indictments are sealed, so the specific charges and, most importantly, the person or persons being charged are not yet known. Arrests could be made as soon as Monday, according to CNN.  Mueller has been leading the Russia probe since May; he was appointed shortly after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. The investigation includes exploring any possible collusion between Trump’s 2016 campaign and the Russian government, the Trump family’s financial ties to Russia, and any obstruction of justice by Trump in the investigation that was started by Comey.  Vox’s Zack Beauchamp and Andrew Prokop explained the Mueller investigation in more detail here.  What isn’t clear from Friday’s news is the target or targets of the Mueller indictments. But two prominent Trump officials have long been at the center of the Russia investigation: Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and Gen. Michael Flynn, who served briefly as Trump’s national security adviser.  Manafort’s house was raided in the course of the investigation, and people close to him have been issued subpoenas. Mueller’s team reportedly told Manafort, who ran Trump’s campaign during the summer of 2016, to expect an indictment.  As Vox previously explained, “Manafort’s history of pro-Russia consulting work and experience with international skullduggery have long made him a prime suspect for potential collusion.” He is said to have attended a meeting at Trump Tower in 2016 with Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian attorney. No firm evidence of collusion has yet surfaced, but the Mueller probe has also investigated Manafort’s work before the presidential campaign, whether he properly disclosed his work for foreign entities, and whether he has ever been involved in illegal money laundering overseas.  The endgame, according to previous reports, is federal investigators want to use the pressure of criminal charges to get convince Manafort to provide more details on any possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.  Mueller is also known to be investigating Gen. Flynn, as Vox has documented. Previous reports have suggested that Flynn may have been involved in efforts to contact Russian hackers about accessing Hillary Clinton’s emails. Flynn was also reported to have had extensive contact with Russian officials during the presidential campaign.  Flynn, whom Trump had appointed to be his national security adviser after aiding his 2016 campaign, stepped down in February once it became clear he had lied about his contacts with a Russian ambassador shortly after the election.  As of mid-Saturday morning, Trump — who suggested he could attempt to remove Mueller if the Russia investigation went in directions that he didn’t like — had not yet tweeted or otherwise commented about the pending charges.  So here is what we know for sure:  Charges have been filed and approved by the federal grand jury, the first of Mueller’s investigation  Arrests could be made in next few days  And what we don’t:",3.769230769230769,13,"[5.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.0, 5.0, 2.0, 4.5, 5.0, 0.5, 4.5, 4.0]"

During a speech at the Remembrance Project conference, an organization that represents the illegal alien crime victims’ families, Bannon blasted the Bush dynasty, calling out President George W. Bush specifically on his lack of leadership on the issue of illegal and legal immigration.  “You want to know why I detest the elites of the Republican Party,” Bannon said. “Where were they? Where is Jeb Bush? Where were all these guys? Bush… Bush… Old man Bush – and the son today got a book out, you know. ‘The demise of the Republican Party, this Republican Party is falling apart.

I don’t care how long you wear the boots, brother. You’re a Yankee brahmin, okay.  Bannon also slammed the employers of illegal aliens, the mainstream media, and the Democratic Party for not only turning a blind eye to illegal immigration but incentivizing more of it.  “Here’s the bottom line … here’s why it happened and here’s why it’s continuing to happen: People make money off it,” Bannon said. “They want the cheap labor, right.

You should count, that’s the way the country was founded.”  As Breitbart News recently reported, under President George W. Bush, more than 30,000 illegal aliens were allowed at one time to enter the United States following Hurricane Katrina in order to take American blue-collar jobs that would have otherwise gone to U.S. workers who had been devastated by the storm.  Additionally, former Department of Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge, appointed by Bush, routinely called for amnesty for illegal aliens and promoted open borders policies.",1.0,3,"[0.5, 0.5, 2.0]"
4,82,8,29,2017,2017-08-29,Vox,Hurricane Harvey is a humanitarian disaster. It will also send gas prices soaring.,"Hurricane Harvey has already taken an enormous human toll on the Gulf Coast, killing at least eight people and forcing around 30,000 to seek shelter from the unprecedented rainfall. But it’s also devastating American energy production — and people across the US are likely to feel the effects at the gas pump in the weeks to come.  At least 10 oil refinery plants in the Houston and Corpus Christi areas have shuttered in the past few days due to record levels of rain and flooding from Harvey. Given how crucial Texas is to oil refinement for the entire country, that’s an enormous disruption.  “At this moment now, we’re talking about somewhere around 15 to 16 percent of all US refining capacity offline,” Patrick DeHaan, a senior petroleum analyst at GasBuddy, a firm that monitors gasoline pricing, told me.  Refinery plants process crude oil and turn it into usable products like gasoline and jet fuel. With so many refineries shut down, gasoline is growing scarcer, and prices are set to soar for consumers.  DeHaan estimates that in the next two weeks, gasoline prices could increase between 20 and 35 cents percent per gallon in the Gulf Coast region, between 10 and 25 cents per gallon in the Midwest, and between 5 and 15 cents per gallon on the East and West Coasts.  It’s unclear how long it will take for the oil refineries to start operating at full capacity again; it will take weeks at least, according to experts. But if history is any guide, prices should also come down fairly quickly after they peak.  According to PIRA Energy, a forecasting and analytics unit of energy data provider S&P Global Platts, gasoline prices typically return to normal two to four weeks after a crisis-induced peak, like after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.  The price of American oil is actually declining  But while gasoline prices are spiking, the price of crude oil is actually declining — US crude oil futures, publicly traded financial products that reflect wholesale oil prices, dropped more than 3 percent on Monday.  The main reason is that it’s easier to shield oil rigs from hurricanes than it is to protect oil refineries from them.  A great deal of oil production takes place in offshore rigs that are evacuated and go offline in advance of storms but can handle the rain and wind relatively well. They’re built for the water and based in the water, so they’re just not susceptible to being flooded in the same way, and they can return to production quickly.  Oil refineries, by contrast, are based on land. That makes them vulnerable to flooding and costly long-term damage.  “After Hurricane Katrina hit, the disruption to production was short-lived, but damage to refiners was long-lasting — some of them were down for more than a year,” Antoine Halff, a scholar at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy and former analyst at the International Energy Agency, told me.  Many analysts and the market predict that once again, production will resume far more quickly than refining. That means we’re likely to see a huge buildup of crude oil that normally would be processed and turned into gasoline and other products but now won’t have anywhere to go until refineries are back online. The supply of crude oil will temporarily surpass the usual demand, which is what’s sending its price downward.  But there’s another wrinkle: Over the past decade or so, the Gulf Coast has seen an enormous boom in shale oil production — a form of oil production with land-based facilities.  And while those shale oil facilities were theoretically built to withstand coastal flooding, there’s reason to be skeptical. Halff says thousands of small oil companies have built up their operations on the Gulf Coast with extreme haste and they simply haven’t been tested.  “It’s not clear that all that new capacity was built to the highest standards of flood resilience,” he says.  Given the unprecedented nature of the rainfall, floods might overwhelm shale oil facilities and take them offline for long periods of time. If that happens, then the US’s energy challenges may end up being even worse than we thought.",3.5,1,[3.5]

Mrs. May’s long-awaited intervention, during a speech in Florence, Italy, was being watched closely in capitals on the Continent and in London, where members of her cabinet have been fiercely divided over Britain’s tortuous divorce from the bloc. The speech aimed to open the way to serious negotiations on what is commonly known as Brexit, and to a broader and more productive discussion about Britain’s relationship with the bloc.  However, while offering some concessions designed to do that, Mrs. May did not give any fresh insight into the type of ties she ultimately wants Britain to have to the bloc — a question that divides her cabinet and her Conservative, or Tory, Party.  The European Union’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, issued a cautious response, saying in a statement that, “We look forward to the United Kingdom’s negotiators explaining the concrete implications of Prime Minister Theresa May’s speech. Our ambition is to find a rapid agreement on the conditions of the United Kingdom’s orderly withdrawal, as well as on a possible transition period.”",2.75,6,"[4.5, 3.5, 3.0, 3.0, 0.5, 2.0]"
1528,3196,6,20,2017,2017-06-20,Vox,Making cities more dense always sparks resistance. Here’s how to overcome it.,"Urban density, done well, has all kinds of benefits. On average, people who live in dense, walkable areas tend to be physically healthier, happier, and more productive. Local governments pay less in infrastructure costs to support urbanites than they to support suburbanites. Per-capita energy consumption is lower in dense areas, which is good for air pollution and climate change.  Plus, dense, walkable areas tend to be buzzy and culturally vibrant. There’s a reason they are often so expensive to live in — lots of people want to live there. Demand exceeds supply.  But creating a dense, walkable area almost always means increasing the density of a built environment that already exists. Especially in developed countries, they’re not building a lot of new cities. They’re working with existing ones. And cities built after the advent of the automobile were generally built around cars, which generally means low density.  Densifying can mean up-zoning to allow greater height in existing urbanized areas, or to allow duplexes, triplexes, or apartments in previously single-family areas. It can mean allowing for mother-in-law units (“accessory dwelling units,” or ADUs, in the lingo) or units along back lanes and alleys. It can mean extending transit to new areas.  But one way or another it means change. It means telling the residents of an area that a bunch more people are moving in. And that always generates resistance, sentiment that has taken on the name NIMBY [Not In My Backyard].  I asked urbanist Brent Toderian, who has worked with numerous cities on densification projects, how he thinks about, and deals with, NIMBYs in 2017. (More of our conversation here.)  David Roberts  My hometown of Seattle is full of purportedly progressive people who enjoy urban amenities like everyone else, but if you ask them to up-zone, it’s a revolution. Talk a little about NIMBYs.  Brent Toderian  I work all over the world, and there are NIMBYs everywhere. Density is never easy. Change is never easy. We have a bias towards the status quo and we tend to weigh loss more heavily than gain. That is human nature.  To me, NIMBY is not a pejorative. It means people are saying, “that thing — we don’t want it in our backyard, in our neighborhood.” There’s nothing inherently bad about that. Sometimes it’s a reasonable point! I don’t want an abattoir in my backyard. I don’t want a concrete-batching plant in my backyard. There are things we don’t want in our backyard, and when you combine that with human nature, almost anything in your backyard that you don’t currently have is going to be a challenge.  So I don’t begrudge NIMBYs. I value them. I listen carefully and I learn what they’re afraid of, why they say no. Often I will learn how to do yes better and address their fears, or at least mitigate them.  NIMBYs are not necessarily the problem. They are behaving normally for humans. The problem is politicians and other decision-makers who know better, who don’t do the right thing because of NIMBY fear. If you’ve had a long process, heard from thousands of people, investigated and understood the technical issues, know your aspirations as a city, and you let 10 or 15 individuals at the last minute show up at council and turn it down? I don’t blame those 15 individuals, I blame the leaders.  I think we need to train our politicians on how to work with the NIMBY mindset and do the right thing in its context. Doing a “yes,” but a better yes, educated by NIMBY fear.  David Roberts  How can public officials get better at that?  Brent Toderian  If you think NIMBYs are hard, it’s astronomically worse when the NIMBYs are right. So you should do everything you can to avoid helping the NIMBYs be right.  I’ll often point to existing buildings and say, “If I thought that’s what I was going to get as a community, I’d be against it too.” The city has to be able to virtually guarantee the quality of the outcome from the urban design, livability, multimodal perspective. And a lot of cities have not set up the culture, the structure, the capacity, the training, or the tools to deliver quality. So when NIMBYs express a fear of change over density, they’re often right.  Don’t let them be right, is what I’m saying. Vancouver has a track record of delivering density in a pretty good way, so we can have a different conversation about change and density and height.  David Roberts  How do you make density something that communities welcome?  Brent Toderian  I don’t support stupid density. I sometimes have as much concern about the YIMBY [Yes In My Backyard] movement as I do about the NIMBY movement. I don’t buy an absolute not-in-my-backyard, but I also don’t buy the argument that we should get rid of our zoning codes and have at it, build as much as we can. Both of those are the extreme.  The conversation needs to be around quality city-making, so I talk about QIMBY — not the Mayor of Springfield on the Simpsons, but quality in my backyard.  Density done well has three components.  One, it has to be of a very high design quality. I don’t just mean aesthetics, although that can be part of it, but it’s about profound relationships being addressed through smart design.  The second piece is that it has to be multimodal. In fact, it has to have active transport priority: walking, biking, and transit have to be emphasized. If you try to design density around cars, it’s a recipe for failure. You have to make walking, biking, and transit not just available, but delightful.  The third piece is amenities and a diversity of housing types, to make density not just compact, but livable and lovable. It’s the difference between cramming people in and creating great neighborhoods. So, amenities such as parks and green spaces, public and people places, heritage preservation and integration, community and cultural facilities, civic facilities, even things like incubator space for artists. Amenities are the things that give communities heart and vibrancy. It also includes housing diversity: rental housing and public housing.  Unless you are planning in a magical city where you have infinite resources — and I haven’t seen that city yet — you are struggling to pay for those kinds of amenities, or achieve that kind of housing diversity. In many cases, you can’t mandate it from developers, because that’s beyond your power. So tools like density bonusing are critically important to delivering that piece of the puzzle.  David Roberts  Explain density bonusing.  Brent Toderian  You have a base density, but [a developer] can increase to a higher density by negotiating amenities that make that higher density more livable. The key is to make sure that you’re spending the value on things that make density successful.  I help cities set up these systems all over the world. It makes the conversation about density with developers different. It gives them a higher level of certainty within the political process, which they like.  And it gives the community a sense that the additional density is translating into something that’s going to support quality of life. They can see a connection between the additional density and amenities their community needs, but probably won’t be able to afford.  And that’s key: It should always pay for things the community couldn’t realistically afford without the density. It doesn’t replace the obligation to pay for the basics. But most cities are struggling to pay for things that go beyond the basics.  Vancouver has the most robust density bonusing system in the world. It’s not even close. And it’s one of the keys to our livability. It’s entirely changed the politics.  It is somewhere between a disappointment and travesty that cities are creating massive amounts of value through municipal decisions around density without leveraging some of that value to pay for the things that cities are struggling to afford, the amenities that make density livable and lovable.  David Roberts  You’ve said that it’s often harder for cities to stop doing the wrong thing than it is to start doing some of the right thing. Is that because of established constituencies?  Brent Toderian  Yes. Because there are angry people who will yell at you. You need the will to stand up to that. When I work with cities, a lot of my time is spent preparing them for the storm.  I’ve sat in the municipal chair; I’ve felt the storm directly. I’ve had development agencies try to get me fired for taking firm positions. My job in Calgary was almost literally to turn things around, and you never do that without making many people upset.  This is going to sound overly simplistic, but the truth is, it often starts with a better city-wide conversation. In Vancouver, you can’t swing a stick without hitting an event talking about cities. Its constant, it’s unrelenting. It wasn’t always that way, but it’s certainly that way now.  There’s other cities I work in where the conversation is non-existent, so when you try to introduce a new policy, a new strategy, or an unusual development that doesn’t match the status quo, it’s very easy for all hell to break loose.  Having a broad conversation about city-making doesn’t mean those individual conversations are miraculously easy, but they are different, because you can draft behind a broader conversation with broader participants, who aren’t just against things but are also for things.  A lot of my work with cities and even state-level governments is about changing the larger conversation so that all the smaller conversations aren’t so angry and bloody.  David Roberts  What are some quick wins that can help build public support?  Brent Toderian  You can support catalyst projects [one-off demonstration projects], but ultimately, it’s going to be about the quality of your results. One of the best ways to improve the conversation about development is to make sure there’s better development. If you don’t like NIMBYs, don’t make them right.",4.25,2,"[4.0, 4.5]"

On Monday, Sept. 11, 2017, Equifax said it has made changes to address customer complaints since it disclosed a week earlier that it exposed vital data on about 143 million Americans. Equifax has come under fire from members of Congress, state attorneys general, and people who are getting conflicting answers about whether their information was stolen. Equifax is trying again to clarify language about people’s right to sue, and said Monday it has made changes to address customer complaints. (AP Photo/Mike Stewart, File)  NEW YORK (AP) — Credit agency Equifax traced the theft of sensitive information about 143 million Americans to a software flaw that could have been fixed well before the burglary occurred, further undermining its credibility as the guardian of personal data that can easily be used for identity theft.  Equifax identified a weakness in an open-source software package called Apache Struts as the technological crack that allowed hackers to heist Social Security numbers, birthdates, addresses and full legal names from a massive database maintained primarily for lenders.  SECURITY FOR DUMMIES  The disclosure , made late Wednesday, cast the company’s damaging security lapse in an even harsher light. The software problem was detected in March and a recommended software patch was released shortly afterward. Equifax said the database intrusion began in May and continued until July.  Security experts said Equifax had more than enough opportunity to block intruders by sealing the security hole. “There is no excuse for not following basic cybersecurity hygiene,” said Nate Fick, CEO of the security firm Endgame. “Some heads should definitely roll for this; it’s only a question of how many.”  The company didn’t respond to inquiries on Thursday.  Equifax was already under fire for not disclosing the break-in until Sept. 7 — nearly six weeks after the company discovered it— as well as for its handling of consumer inquiries about their exposure whether their personal information had been compromised and how they could protect their identities.  THE ENRON COMPARISON  On Thursday, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, called for the resignations of CEO Richard Smith and Equifax’s entire board of directors unless the company offers consumers more comprehensive identity-theft protection for the next decade. So far, Equifax is merely offering free credit monitoring for a year. It’s also temporarily waiving fees for people who freeze their credit records to prevent identity thieves from defrauding them.  “What has transpired over the past several months is one of the most egregious examples of corporate malfeasance since Enron,” Schumer said, invoking the name of a notorious company that manipulated energy markets and eventually went bankrupt.  Investors are clearly concerned about Equifax’s fate. The company’s stock has lost nearly a third of its value since it disclosed the breach. Three Equifax executives, including the company’s chief financial officer, preserved a significant chunk of their wealth by selling stock worth a combined $1.8 million just after management learned of the breach, but well before the public was notified.  Equifax said last week that the officials didn’t know about the breach at the time of those sales.  MORE INVESTIGATION  In another sign of the storm swirling around Equifax, the Federal Trade Commission took the unusual step of announcing it has opened a probe into the company’s practices.  The FTC is not the only Washington authority looking into the breach. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau previously announced its own investigation, and the House Financial Services Committee plans to hold hearings on the breach in early October when Smith is scheduled to testify. Politicians from both major parties are calling for additional investigations by Congress or the Department of Justice, raising the possibility of criminal charges.  A proposal to impose sweeping reforms on Equifax and its two main peers, TransUnion and Experian, also has been drawn up by Rep. Maxine Waters, D-California.  _____  Liedtke reported from San Francisco.",5.0,2,"[5.0, 5.0]"

Gusting winds and dry air forecast for Thursday could drive the next wave of devastating wildfires that are already well on their way to becoming the deadliest and most destructive in California history. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg)  SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Smoke from the wildfires north of San Francisco plunged air quality levels in the Bay Area to the same unhealthy level as China’s notoriously polluted capital, sending people to emergency rooms and forcing schools to close and people to wear masks when they step outside.  The region has endured days of choking smoke since the fires began Sunday night and claimed at least 31 lives and destroyed thousands of homes and businesses. The smoke cast a dull haze over San Francisco’s scenic skyline, and poor visibility has led to numerous flight delays and cancellations at the city’s airport.  Air quality in most of the region Thursday and Friday was as bad as smog-choked Beijing, according to the Bay Area Air Quality Management District.  “We have unprecedented levels of smoke and particles in the air that we normally don’t see,” said Ralph Borrmann, a spokesman for the district.  He called it the worst air quality ever recorded in many parts of the Bay Area.  Since Wednesday, about 15 percent of flights in and out of San Francisco International Airport experienced delays because air traffic controllers have had to separate aircrafts at a greater distance, airport spokesman Doug Yakel said Friday.  Officials warned that very fine smoke particles, thinner than a human hair, can get lodged in the lungs and into the bloodstream, causing irreparable damage to the body. In Solano County, hospitals there received more than 250 people who complained of toxic air inhalation, county health officer Bela Matyas said Thursday.  At an Ace Hardware store in San Francisco’s financial district, phones were ringing nonstop with customers looking to buy breathing masks. But they were sold out, as were most stores in the area.  With winds expected to keep blowing in smoke from the fires to populated areas this weekend, many schools decided to close Friday. Organizers canceled weekend events, including an Oktoberfest in Walnut Creek and a fitness festival and half marathon in San Francisco.  Sports teams are monitoring the air quality as they prepare to host games.  The Oakland Raiders are still planning to host the Los Angeles Chargers in Oakland on Sunday, but the team said it will keep monitoring and will update fans if there are changes. The NFL had considered moving the game if it becomes necessary.  Officials at the University of California, Berkeley and Stanford University planned to proceed with games Friday and Saturday, respectively. Stanford encouraged fans to bring donations for victims of the fires to the game.",4.5,1,[4.5]

The information comes one day after Manafort appeared in court on charges including money laundering and other financial crimes.  In a court filing, the office of special counsel Robert Mueller says the precise value of Manafort’s assets is hard to quantify.  They say in November 2016 and January 2017, he noted assets to be worth approximately $25 million, but he has provided significantly higher amounts at other times.  The prosecutors say Manafort’s business associate, Rick Gates, who was also charged Monday, has also stated conflicting amounts.

(Oct. 31)  Trump has nominated former campaign adviser Sam Clovis to serve as chief scientist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  Clovis had communicated with George Papadopoulos, who admitted to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians intermediaries last year.  Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan says she has concerns about Clovis’ qualifications to coordinate agricultural research, and his contact with Papadopoulos raises a whole separate set of questions.  Meghan Cline, a spokeswoman for Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts of Kansas, says the committee will announce a hearing date for Clovis soon.  __  3:45 p.m.  The White House is continuing to distance itself from the former campaign aide thrust into the center of special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe.  White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders says Tuesday that George Papadopoulos is an example of “somebody doing the wrong thing while the president’s campaign did the right thing.”  She said the campaign fully cooperated with investigators while “what Papadopoulos did was lie.”  Sanders also said Trump only met Papadopoulos once and said he played a “minimal role, if one at all.”  Papadopoulos has provided key evidence in the first criminal case connecting Trump’s team to alleged intermediaries for Russia’s government. Court documents unsealed Monday show he admitted to lying to the FBI about meetings with Russian intermediaries.  ___  11:35 a.m.  The Associated Press has confirmed the identities of two foreign nationals at the center of contacts between Russia and a former adviser to President Donald Trump’s campaign.  Emails obtained by the AP show that George Papadopoulos’ conversations, cited in court papers, were with Joseph Mifsud and Ivan Timofeev.  Mifsud is a professor and honorary director of the London Academy of Diplomacy. Ivan Timofeev is director of programs at the Russian International Affairs Council in Moscow.  Court papers filed by special counsel Robert Mueller did not name the men. They say a professor told Papadopoulos in April 2016 that the Russians had “dirt” on Democrat Hillary Clinton in the form of emails. They also say Papadopoulos had discussions with the other man, described as having connections to the Russian foreign ministry.  __  10:20 a.m.  President Donald Trump is tweeting that the “biggest story” out of the charges announced Monday in the Russia investigation is the resignation of Democratic lobbyist Tony Podesta from his eponymous firm.

The president added, “He and his brother could Drain The Swamp, which would be yet another campaign promise fulfilled.

Sekulow says: “The president has not indicated to me or to anyone else that I work with that he has any intent on terminating Robert Mueller.”  On pardons, Sekulow says: “I have not had a conversation with the president regarding pardons. And pardons are not on the table.”  ___  6:50 a.m.  The Kremlin says Russia is not implicated by the first criminal cases against associates of President Donald Trump.  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov says that “so far Russia doesn’t figure in any way in these charges which have been made” and that Russia hopes that they do not feed “hysteria.”  Peskov adds that accusations of Russian meddling in the election remain “unfounded,” and “we are observing (the situation) with interest.”  Peskov also says that connections between former Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos and a man he believed to have links to the Russian Foreign Ministry did not prove any complicity by the Russian government.  ___  3:10 a.m.  Special counsel Robert Mueller has sent a warning to individuals in President Donald Trump’s orbit: If they lie about contacts between the president’s campaign and Russians, they’ll end up on the wrong end of federal criminal charges.

Downey's severely decomposed body was found in February of 1984 but wasn't identified until this spring when the FBI began using new fingerprint technology to resolve identity cases dating back to the 1970s. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)  DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Just after Thanksgiving Day in 1983, James Downey dropped off his older brother, John, at a Houston bus station, then quickly turned away so neither the police nor a motorcycle gang affiliated with his brother could later demand details about where the bus was headed.  For 34 years, he didn’t hear a word about him. Then this spring Downey received a heart-breaking call, one that more than 200 families across the country have gotten in the last few months since the FBI began using new fingerprint technology to resolve identity cases dating back to the 1970s.  Authorities reported that the remains of a man found beaten to death decades ago along a brushy path in Des Moines, 800 miles away, had been identified as his brother.  “We always figured something had happened to him,” James Downey said from his home in Houston. “We all assumed he’d got killed somewhere or died in an accident.”  Since launching the new effort in February, the FBI and local medical examiner offices have identified 204 bodies found between 1975 and the late 1990s. The cases stretch across the country, with the largest number in Arizona, California, New York, Florida and Texas.  Using a new computer algorithm, an FBI unit has taken another look at fingerprints from about 1,500 bodies found years or even decades ago and succeeded in making more than 200 matches to prints previously on record. (Oct. 31)  “We didn’t know the actual potential success. We were hoping to identify a few cases, maybe five or 10,” said Bryan Johnson, a manager in the FBI’s Latent Fingerprint Support Unit who proposed the effort. “We’re really proud that we found another way of doing this.”  Under the new program, Johnson and eight others in the FBI unit ran fingerprints from about 1,500 bodies through a new computer algorithm that could make matches from low-quality prints or even a single finger or thumb. Previously, the standard algorithm typically needed quality prints from all 10 fingers to make a match.  The unit is now urging local authorities to search through other old case files and send in smudged or partial prints that couldn’t previously be matched.  The FBI’s newfound ability was key to the Des Moines case because by the time Downey’s body was found in February 1984, it had been buried under snow and dirt for months and was severely decomposed. Authorities sought the public’s help in identifying the body, including publishing drawings of distinctive tattoos in the local newspaper, but no one came forward.  “We know he was murdered and dumped in this area but Des Moines police never really developed any leads on it and basically forgot about the case,” county Medical Examiner Greg Schmunk said.  It was one of several cases that medical examiner investigators called “shelf dwellers,” referring to cremated remains that would sit for decades on storage shelves.  But the fact that this was a homicide and the unusual tattoos — including a skeleton clad in Nazi garb and a cartoon figure wearing a hat and smoking a cigarette — prompted investigators to rummage through police archives and resubmit the single available thumbprint into the Missing and Unidentified Persons System, called NamUs.  They were shocked months later when the FBI’s Johnson called to confirm they had matched the thumbprint to prints of Downey taken after an earlier arrest in Texas.  About 40 percent of the identifications through the FBI’s new process have been cases in Arizona. Most are people who died while attempting to make the dangerous desert crossing from Mexico.  Bruce Anderson, the forensic anthropologist for Pima County, Arizona, keeps more than 1,000 unidentified person charts filed along his office wall.  “If you can remove one of these charts, have one family reach out to you to confirm an identity, some of that weight on us is removed,” Anderson said.  In nearby Yuma County, Arizona, the FBI fingerprint initiative enabled authorities to finally identify a young woman whose body was found in 1999 near the Colorado River, where she was killed with a shotgun blast to her face.  For Sgt. Ryland Croutch, the identification of the victim as 18-year-old Angel McAllister, through a match with an earlier smudged print, was a relief. He’d been assigned to the killing only a few years after starting his job with the Yuma County sheriff’s office, and as the years passed had promised himself that he’d discover her identity before retiring.  “She was such a pretty young girl,” said Crouch, now 58. “And it sounds like she was smart, but she had some demons, people she liked to hang out with who were dangerous.” He said he’s hopeful that investigators now can find leads to her killer.

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said Saturday that the OPEC-led agreement is necessary to balance supply with demand.  Saudi Arabia is the world’s largest producer and the most influential member of OPEC. The agreement, which kicked in at the start of 2017, also included Russia and other non-OPEC countries.  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is expected to take up the agreement at its next meeting on Nov. 30.  In a statement, Prince Mohammed said that Saudi Arabia “affirms its readiness to extend the production cut agreement, which proved its feasibility by rebalancing supply and demand.”  The effect of the production limits approved by major oil countries has been muted by rising output from U.S. shale-oil producers. The prince said that high demand for oil has absorbed the increased supply from shale oil.  “The journey toward restoring balance to markets, led by the Kingdom, is proving successful despite the challenges,” he said.  On Friday, Brent Crude, the international benchmark oil, rose above $60 for the first time since 2015 as traders grew increasingly confident that OPEC will continue to limit pumping.  The slump in oil prices that began in mid-2014 has created budget problems for Saudi Arabia and other major producers. Prince Mohammed has laid out a sweeping plan to wean Saudi Arabia off its near total dependence on oil exports.  Jim Krane, an energy expert at Rice University in Houston, said Saudi Arabia needs to keep oil prices up to balance its budget and make the upcoming public sale of stock in Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil company, attractive to investors.  “Nobody is going to want a piece of Saudi Aramco with oil under $40, which is where it would be if OPEC wasn’t choking off supply,” he said.  Krane said OPEC cutbacks and higher prices would help boost U.S. production in Texas and North Dakota.",3.524390243902439,41,"[0.5, 3.0, 3.0, 2.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 5.0, 2.5, 2.0, 5.0, 4.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.0, 3.0, 5.0, 4.0, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 1.5, 5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 2.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 1.5, 3.5, 3.5]"

Day by day, the accusations pile up, as scores of women come forward to say they were victims of Weinstein. But others with stories to tell have not. For some of these women who’ve chosen not to go public, the fear of being associated forever with the sordid scandal _ and the effects on their careers, and their lives _ might be too great. Or they may still be struggling with the lingering effects of their encounters. (Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP, File)  LOS ANGELES (AP) — Authorities in Los Angeles and New York said Thursday they had opened new investigations into Harvey Weinstein, the latest in a series of criminal probes into conduct by the disgraced film mogul which has sparked a sexual harassment scandal roiling Hollywood and other industries.  The Manhattan district attorney’s office said a senior prosecutor has been assigned to investigate allegations by “Boardwalk Empire” actress Paz de la Huerta, who told CBS News that Weinstein raped her twice in her apartment in 2010. Spokeswoman Joan Vollero said New York police were also involved, but further details could not be provided.  De la Huerta spoke to CBS News by phone and said the first rape occurred in October 2010 after Weinstein gave her a ride home from a party, insisted on having a drink in her apartment and forced himself on her. She said the second rape occurred in December 2010 after Weinstein came to her apartment; she had been drinking and was not in a condition to give consent, CBS reported the actress said.  Los Angeles police are investigating allegations about Weinstein that occurred in 2015, but spokesman Josh Rubenstein said he could not provide any additional details. The department is also investigating a report by an Italian actress and model who said she was raped by Weinstein in 2013.  Charlotte Triggs, senior editor for People Magazine, discusses the sexual harassment, abuse and assault allegations leveled against some of Hollywood's biggest stars. (Nov. 2)  Weinstein representative Sallie Hofmeister reiterated a statement that Weinstein, 65, denies all allegations of non-consensual sex.  Authorities in Beverly Hills and London are also investigating Weinstein for possible criminal cases.  The investigations came four weeks after The New York Times published an expose of sexual harassment allegations against Weinstein, leading to his firing from the company he co-founded and his expulsion from the producers guild and the organization that bestows the Academy Awards.  The accusations against Weinstein have prompted numerous allegations of sexual harassment and abuse against powerful men in Hollywood and other industries.  CNN reported on Thursday that eight current or former “House of Cards” workers claim that Kevin Spacey made the production a “toxic” workplace and one ex-employee alleges the actor sexually assaulted him.  The workers’ identities were withheld from Thursday’s report because they fear professional fallout, the cable news channel said.  Among them is a former production assistant who alleged that Spacey assaulted him during one of the Netflix show’s early seasons, and CNN reported that all of the people described Spacey’s behavior as predatory.  The report accuses Spacey of allegedly targeting staffers who were typically young and male with nonconsensual touching and crude comments.  Netflix has suspended production on the series, which was slated to end after its sixth season. The streaming service and “House of Cards” producers said Thursday that one allegation against Spacey involved a remark and gesture made during production of the show’s first season in 2012. After, Spacey willingly participated in training and producer Media Rights Capital said it was not aware of any additional complaints against the actor since then.  The production company said it has instituted a hotline for complaints and will investigate them thoroughly. There was no word on the fate of “House of Cards” in Thursday’s statements.  A person with knowledge of the decision said late Thursday that Spacey’s publicist and talent agency CAA have parted ways with the actor. His representatives on Wednesday said the two-time Oscar winner was in treatment for an unspecified condition.  Also on Thursday, actor Corey Feldman appeared on “The Dr. Oz Show” and named the man who he said molested him when he was a young teen.  Feldman made his comments in an interview with series host Mehmet Oz and in an on-air call that Oz identified as being to the Los Angeles Police Department.  Los Angeles Police Department Officer Drake Madison says the department is aware of the show, but no report has yet been filed.  The Associated Press is withholding his name because the man could not be located to comment on Feldman’s allegations.  Feldman, 46, gained fame in the 1980s with films including “Gremlins,” ″The Goonies” and “Stand by Me.”  While the outcome of criminal investigations into allegations against Weinstein remains unclear, the producer may have to give sworn testimony in a lawsuit he filed against his former company.  Attorneys for The Weinstein Co. told a Delaware judge on Thursday that they want to take sworn testimony from the producer, who is suing to gain access to his personnel file and emails.  Weinstein’s seeking the records to defend himself in potential civil and criminal cases, and to help the company respond to a civil rights investigation by New York’s attorney general.  The judge said Weinstein could be deposed, even though his attorney said a deposition would be “tricky” and “fraught with problems,” given the ongoing criminal investigations. The attorney said Weinstein’s ability to testify would be limited without waiving his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination.  ___  AP Television Writer Lynn Elber and Entertainment Writer Anthony McCartney in Los Angeles, AP writer Randall Chase in Dover, Delaware, contributed to this report.",3.3181818181818183,88,"[0.5, 5.0, 3.0, 0.5, 3.5, 2.5, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.0, 1.0, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 2.5, 1.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.0, 5.0, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 2.0, 2.5, 1.5, 4.5, 4.5, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0, 2.5, 4.0, 0.5, 5.0, 5.0, 1.5, 3.5, 4.5, 2.5, 4.0, 4.0, 2.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.0, 0.5, 3.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 1.5, 4.5, 4.5, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 2.5, 1.5, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 2.0, 3.5, 4.0, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 0.5, 3.0, 4.0, 1.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 1.5]"
1137,2716,10,28,2017,2017-10-28,Fox News,Big tax cuts could spark America’s greatest economic growth since 1980s,"President Ronald Reagan wisely said: “You can’t be for big government, big taxes, and big bureaucracy and still be for the little guy.”  The Tax Reform Act of 1986 stands as the single greatest example we’ve known of bipartisan federal income tax policy. Once it was enacted, our nation had a simpler tax code with fewer tax exemptions and loopholes, and significantly lower rates. This brought relief to American families and businesses.  Now five administrations and two generations later, we must again act boldly and with bipartisanship to jumpstart our economy.  The Trump administration and Congress have an opportunity to build an economic legacy. By enacting comprehensive tax reform, they would spur economic growth and ensure American prosperity far into the future. Both Democrats and Republicans can be heroes to their constituents by passing tax reform and kicking off economic growth similar to what we experienced three decades ago.  Under President Reagan, the highest income tax rate was lowered from 50 percent to 28 percent and the bottom income tax rate went from 11 percent to 15 percent. The change to the tax code also removed the distinction between earned and unearned income.  Additionally, homeownership was encouraged by increasing the mortgage interest deduction. Americans kept more of what they earned and were incentivized to invest. The economy soared.  This is a far cry from our income tax code today, with the highest rate at 39.6 percent. The previous four administrations have reversed much of the progress made in 1986 and have managed to vastly increase the national debt from $2 trillion to more than $20 trillion.  When you factor in the current job-killing corporate income tax rate of 35 percent – the highest among the 35 nations in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development – the Trump administration is right to suggest that the time is now for Congress to pass the largest income tax reform measure since 1986.  Bipartisanship is required for this overhaul. This can be encouraged by demonstrating one basic economic principle that both Democrats and Republicans understand: incentives. Technically speaking, we’re talking about the behavioral effects of a tax cut.  The administration’s current tax reform plan suggests a corporate rate reduction from 35 percent to 20 percent. In addition, it cuts the pass-through rate to 25 percent and proposes allowing companies to fully expense nonstructural capital expenditures for at least five years, which would allow businesses to write off equipment purchases in full in the year of purchase.  The proposed tax bill would also simplify individual income tax brackets from eight to four (including the “zero” bracket). Individuals earning less than $12,000 a year – or couples earning $24,000 and filing jointly – would pay no tax, essentially doubling the standard deduction.  The remaining income tax brackets suggested are 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. There is also talk of raising the child tax credit, but by how much is yet to be disclosed.  While reducing the number of brackets is a definite positive, adding deductions and credits removes people from the tax rolls and reduces the impact and strength of the tax bill. However, the overall implications of this tax bill are extremely positive. If passed today, it would surely incentivize the Reaganesque economic growth that this country needs.  Incentives play an enormous role in human decision-making. Providing a benefit for an action will result in more of that action. However, there is a host of evidence that lower tax rates incentivize economic activity, which leads to growth in output, investment and employment.  Lowering the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent would encourage existing businesses to grow and invest in the United States, and would reduce barriers for new businesses to form. After all, entrepreneurs are an essential ingredient to our economic growth. You can’t love jobs and hate job creators.  The key challenge with any reform, especially tax reform, is ensuring its longevity. The “economic miracle of the 1980s"" was prevented from continuing on by the generations that followed it, President Trump said earlier this month in speech at the Heritage Foundation.  How do we learn from that experience and lay a foundation for long-term prosperity in future generations to come? The best way is to each our children and grandchildren that incentives matter. Most children already build an understanding of this principle by achieving good grades, earning an allowance and competing in sports.  We are our children’s first teachers, and we can help them understand that economics is more than a political or academic issue. The relationship between supply, demand and price is consistent throughout everyday life.  Today’s fifth-grader will vote for the first time in 2024. When we commit to raising economically educated children, we prevent readdressing economic policy every four to eight years. Talking with kids about how incentives work in their daily decision making, and then demonstrating how this applies to government policy, is the bridge we need to bring about long-term tax reform and prosperity.  The Trump administration and Congress have an opportunity to enact legislation that could result in the greatest economic growth since the 1980s. Holding members of Congress accountable and teaching children to think economically ensures this prosperity will last for generations.

Republicans, in an effort to pass the tax code, have explored trying to pass tax reform without Democratic support; while Democrats have complained that they have been left out of a crucial, bipartisan process in governing.

Sanders, however, said the GOP’s tax plan is about giving “tax breaks to people who don’t need it.” The senator said he supports “a tax cut for the middle class and working families.”  Throughout the evening, the two senators threw several verbal jabs at each other’s expense.  At one point, Cruz claimed that his 2016 presidential campaign tried to strengthen social security and said politicians in Washington were “recklessly letting it careen towards insolvency.”  “There are no changes at all,” Cruz said. “Every dollar, every penny of benefit is protected, but for young people, people my age …”  “You’re not so young anymore,” Sanders replied.  “You’d be surprised,” Cruz said.  Cruz also joked about the impersonation that comedian Larry David, star of HBO’s “Curb Your Enthusiasm” did of Sanders on an episode of “Saturday Night Live.”  “I’m not interrupting you,” Sanders said, waving his hand as a sign for Cruz to hurry. “Come on, come on.”  “You know, as some might say, curb your enthusiasm,” Cruz quipped. “By the way, the impression that Larry David does of you is spectacular and uncanny.” –Business Insider  Watch:  Ted Cruz to Bernie Sanders: ""As some might say, 'curb your enthusiasm'"" #CNNDebateNight https://t.co/m8N0COvcew — CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 19, 2017  No one does socialist curmudgeon Bernie Sanders like Larry David.

(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)  U.S. Customs and Border Protection says it is ready to block U.S. imports of seafood — as well as any other goods — produced by North Korean laborers who work in China.  An Associated Press investigation tracked salmon, squid and cod processed by North Koreans working at Chinese factories and shipped to American stores, including Walmart and ALDI. The North Korean workers found in Chinese factories aren’t allowed to leave, and receive only a fraction of their pay — most goes straight to the North Korean state. This means that American consumers buying seafood labeled “Caught in the USA, Processed in China” may inadvertently be subsidizing the government of Kim Jong Un as it builds nuclear weapons, and also supporting forced labor.  U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it is reviewing the allegations and if warranted, would “pursue all enforcement actions and prohibit goods from importation as appropriate.” The companies that responded also vowed to investigate ties with suppliers.  At this point anything made by North Korean workers anywhere is presumed to be made with forced labor, the State Department said in a statement Friday.  If you buy salmon from Walmart or ALDI, you may inadvertently have subsidized the North Korean government as it builds its nuclear weapons program, an AP investigation has found. (Oct. 4)  “North Koreans sent overseas do not have a choice in the work; the government ultimately assigns them and they are not free to change jobs,” said the statement, noting that wages and passports are typically withheld by North Korean supervisors.  GOP Congressman Chris Smith from New Jersey, who has repeatedly called for tougher enforcement, said the Labor Department has already identified trafficking in 12 sectors of goods exported by China.  “CBP should be stopping every shipment from those sectors — and now trafficking-tainted salmon too,” he said.  A White House National Security Council spokesman said the North Korean government’s scheme to outsource its labor underscores why the United States has pushed for restrictions on North Korean foreign workers. The spokesman said all countries should, at a minimum, ban companies from bringing in North Korean crews, as pledged in recent United Nations sanctions.  China is among the countries that have promised to comply, already banning imports of North Korean seafood, and saying no more North Korean workers will be allowed starting next year.  “But all nations must go further and reject what is clearly a despicable practice that only serves the regime’s nuclear ambitions,” said the NSC spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to comment.  Walmart said its supplier has addressed the problem, although it did not specify how. Walmart and ALDI said they are committed to human rights and fair labor practices, and expect the same from their business partners.  At a time when North Korea faces sanctions on many exports, the government is sending tens of thousands of workers worldwide, bringing in revenue estimated at anywhere from $200 million to $500 million a year. That could account for a sizable portion of North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile programs, which South Korea says have cost more than $1 billion.  North Koreans overseas work in construction in the Gulf states, shipbuilding in Poland, logging in Russia. In Uruguay, authorities told AP, about 90 North Koreans crewed fishing boats last year.  “I am not surprised at all,” said Anthony Talbott, who directs the University of Dayton’s Human Rights Center. “North Korea has probably the single highest level of state-sanctioned slavery in the world, it’s a major source of income for them.”  Among those North Korean laborers in China, roughly 3,000 are believed to work in the northeast industrial hub of Hunchun, just a few miles from the borders of both North Korea and Russia. AP documented North Koreans in several Hunchun seafood processing plants, and tracked their supply chains to importers, including Sea-Trek Enterprises in Rhode Island, where managers said they are being inundated with phone calls from customers and suppliers since the AP story.  Sea-Trek’s owners said that they hadn’t visited China and were unaware of the makeup of the workers, but would immediately cease dealings with the plant until the situation is resolved.  “Sea-Trek will not purchase product from any company using forced labor,” said vice president Mitch Sarnoff.  Mark Liszt, owner of Lawrence Wholesale, a national food distributor in Southern California, said it would investigate its suppliers as well.  “We’re middlemen,” said Liszt. “We do make a practice of trying to go and visit the plants that we buy from in person, but it’s not a perfect world that we can see into every single one.”  Some U.S. brands and companies had indirect ties to the North Korean laborers in Hunchun, including Chicken of the Sea, owned by Thai Union. Trade records show shipments came from a sister company of the Hunchun factory in another part of China, where Thai Union spokeswoman Whitney Small says labor standards are being met and the employees are all Chinese. Small said the sister company should not be penalized.  AP observed North Korean workers in Chinese factories building hardwood flooring, sewing garments and manufacturing electronics. Fordham University economics professor Giacomo Santangelo said he doubts it’s just fish processed by North Korean workers that reaches the U.S. markets.  “Now we need to ask, how many other products imported from China are made with North Korean labor?” he said.  Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York said U.S. officials must keep products made by North Koreans out of the United States.  “The administration needs to ramp up the pressure on China to crack down on trade with North Korea across the board,” he said.  Ohio’s Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, who helped pass North Korea, Iran and Russia sanctions this summer, said corporations also have a responsibility to make sure they are abiding by U.N. sanctions and U.S. laws.  However, Bucknell University political science professor Zhiqun Zhu said a sanction-based approach that cracks down on imports isn’t going to solve the problem.  “It has so many loopholes,” he said. “All sticks and no carrots will not make the North Korea problem disappear.”  ___  Read earlier story in seafood investigation — http://bit.ly/2kof26j — and more in the series: https://www.apnews.com/tag/RepublicofKim",5.0,1,[5.0]
381,1722,10,5,2017,2017-10-05,Associated Press News,Experts to start capturing rare vaquita porpoises in Mexico," U.S. Navy-trained dolphins and their handlers arrived in Mexico Thursday to participate in a last-ditch effort to catch, enclose and protect the few dozen remaining vaquita porpoises to save them from extinction.  Mexican authorities and an international group of experts say they will set out on Oct. 12 in a fleet of small boats to find the critically endangered and elusive marine mammals with the assistance of the dolphins.  Mexico — where rescue dogs became national heroes during last month’s earthquakes — was quick to release the names of the trained dolphins: Andrea, Fathom, Katrina and, understandably, Splash.  Mexican Environment Secretary Rafael Pacchiano said the U.S. government “has been a great ally in this process, in this unprecedented project.”  Experts acknowledge the catch-and-enclose plan is risky; breeding in captivity has successfully saved species such as the red wolf and California condor, but the vaquita has only been scientifically described since the 1950s and has never been bred or even held in captivity.  “The group of dolphins is trained to help us identify where the vaquitas are, so that once they are located, the group of scientists and veterinarians can capture them and take them to a sanctuary that is almost completely built,” Pacchiano said. The sanctuary is expected to be some kind of floating pen or net enclosure in a protected bay.  “The idea is to keep these vaquitas we capture in a safe, restricted space so that we can look at how to reproduce them and eventually recover the population, and eventually release them,” he said.  Jim Fallin of the U.S. Navy’s Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Pacific said the dolphins arrived at Mexico’s Gulf of California, also known as the Sea of Cortez.  “Navy Marine Mammal Program participation is being limited to four mature female dolphins selected for their gentle nature and demonstrated behavioral acumen,” Fallin said.  The dolphins will use their natural sonar to locate the extremely elusive vaquitas, then surface and advise their handlers, said Fallin. The dolphins have been trained by the Navy for tasks like locating sea mines.  Despite Mexico’s campaign to help the species, which are the world’s smallest and rarest type of porpoises, and live only in the Gulf of California, the number of remaining vaquitas is estimated to have dropped below 30.  Vaquitas are often caught in nets illegally set to catch totoaba fish, whose bladder is prized in China.  Mexico enacted a permanent ban on gillnet fishing in the northern Gulf of California earlier this year.  Alex Olivera, the Mexico representative of the Center for Biological Diversity, saluted the effort but noted the whole Gulf habitat must be protected.  “We support this last-ditch effort to save the vaquita from extinction, but it shouldn’t be used as an excuse to allow fishing to continue in its habitat,” said Olivera.  “This risky option became the only option, but vaquitas have never been captured alive before, so this effort is uncertain,” Olivera said. “It’s a high-stakes operation that’s happening because the Mexican government has shown an inability to protect the animals in the wild.”  Elsewhere, far off Mexico’s western Pacific coast, the head of the country’s nature reserves commission said Thursday that all fishing would be banned in territorial seas around the Revillagigedo Islands, located more than 400 miles (650 kilometers) from the coast.  Commission head Alejandro Del Mazo Maza said the ban imposed on the 57,175 square-mile (148,087 square kilometer) reserve would create the largest unfished marine park in North America.",3.75,6,"[2.5, 2.5, 5.0, 4.0, 4.5, 4.0]"

[VIDEO]  Remember that Geraldo insulted Geller when she was almost killed by two jihadists in Texas…  Geller has long been a target of radical Islamists. Her life has been threatened but she keeps up the fight:  Pam Geller has been spot on when speaking about the truth of jihadists. She spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about how she feels Hollywood is “in the pocket” of jihadis. Very interesting read and lots to learn from this very brave lady:  Pamela Geller has been on a rampage against radical Islam for years, beginning notably in 2010 by spearheading of the opposition to what she called the “Ground Zero Mega Mosque” near the site of the destroyed World Trade Center. Her most recent controversy was the organization of a “Draw the Prophet Muhammad” contest in Texas.  At the event, two self-described jihadists shot a security guard before police killed them. Then, on June 2, police killed a knife-wielding Muslim man in Boston whose goal was allegedly to behead Geller in retaliation for the contest. Even though the contest was a major news story, few media outlets published the winning cartoon. Geller’s group, American Freedom Defense Initiative, put the image on billboards, 100 of which debuted in St. Louis on Monday with the tagline “Support Free Speech.” She spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about how the (largely hostile) media is portraying these events.  Why are you being overly provocative, purposely insulting Muslims?  I am not being overly provocative or purposely insulting Muslims. Islamic jihadists, not I, made Muhammad cartoons the flash point for the defense of the freedom of speech when they began killing over them. If we don’t stand against them on that point, the only alternative is surrender and submission. I did not make the cartoons a flash point, the jihadis did.  But if you just don’t insult their prophet, they’ll leave you alone, no?  No. The death penalty for insulting Muhammad is just one aspect of Sharia. There is much, much more of infidel behavior that violates Sharia. If we refrain from drawing Muhammad, more demands to adhere to other aspects of Sharia will follow. Millions are suffering or have been slaughtered under Islamic Sharia law in Muslim countries. Islamic supremacists mean to impose it in the West.  There is no hate speech exception to the First Amendment. “Hate speech” is a subjective judgment. If it were outlawed, the authority with the power to decide what constitutes it would have the power to control the public debate.… If a group will not bear being offended without resorting to violence, that group will rule unopposed while everyone else lives in fear, while other groups curtail their activities to appease the violent group. This results in the violent group being able to tyrannize the others. Cartoons have been used as satire since the beginning of satire — especially in our country — and no one gets a pass. Not the Pope of Rome, president of the United States or Hollywood’s biggest movie stars.… If you don’t like it, don’t look at it, boycott the network that airs it, don’t buy the publication, make counter-images, make a million, fine, but you have to adjust to us, not we to you, and if that’s too much, don’t come here. Threaten violence? Commit violence? The consequences are yours to bear.  It seems many media pundits who claim allegiance to the First Amendment aren’t persuaded by your arguments.  They are afraid of being killed by Islamic jihadists and camouflage their fear and cowardice as “respect” for Islam and Muslims.  Are there any TV hosts who have been particularly hostile to you during interviews?  Yes. Martha MacCallum, Erin Burnett, Alisyn Camerota, Chris Cuomo — although he let me speak and make my case.  How about behind your back?  Yes. Bill O’Reilly and Laura Ingraham. They said I was insulting the entire religion, one held by our moderate allies such as Egypt and Qatar. They are wrong in assuming that we must submit to Sharia to placate moderates, rather than that moderates need to accept the freedom of speech. Roman Catholics don’t like their religion mocked or the mockery of other religions, but Roman Catholics don’t kill when their religion is mocked — and so no one talks about “provoking” them or “respecting” them. In any pluralistic society, we have to put up with being offended and even with our core beliefs being mocked. Roman Catholics have learned that. Mormons and others have learned that — look at The Book of Mormon on Broadway. Why must we condescend to Muslims and think they cannot learn that? It’s the low expectation of soft bigotry.  So this isn’t entirely a partisan issue where conservatives stand by you and liberals don’t?  No. Chris Hayes stuck up for me on MSNBC. This is not a left/right split, it is a free person/slave split.  Did any TV host say something that struck you as particularly wrongheaded?  They all say I have the right to draw Muhammad but shouldn’t out of respect. They don’t seem to realize that any surrender on this point will only be seen by the jihadists as a victory and embolden them to make more demands. CNN’s Erin Burnett said I relished being the target of a beheading. It’s madness. Who self-promotes to get killed?  So you’re not purposely courting danger, as Burnett and others have insinuated?  Of course not. I love life. But I will not live as a slave.  Are there any TV hosts you’d like to face off with but who won’t have you on?  Bill O’Reilly. I expect he knows he would be shown up.  We know about the man arrested who intended to behead you. Any other threats you can share?  I have received many threats. The FBI and NYPD are aware of them and on the case.  Anyone in Hollywood reach out to you to offer support?  No.  Should Hollywood care about threats against you?  They may think they’re exempt, but they aren’t. Islamic supremacists will be demanding they adhere to Sharia as well. Of course, most producers already are careful not to show anything that might offend Muslims, including accurate representations of jihad plotting and activity, so Hollywood is mostly already in their pocket. But this is their issue, and the entertainment industry should be on the front lines in the information battle space. The jihadists aren’t just coming for me, they are coming for all of us that believe in freedom.  So why do you think Hollywood, which routinely claims to push the envelope in its art, hasn’t supported you?  They’re afraid of being ostracized.  Your “Draw Muhammad” event certainly got a lot of news coverage. Should mainstream media outlets have published the winning cartoon?  Every media outlet should publish the Muhammad cartoons. They can’t kill us all. By kowtowing to violent intimidation, they are inviting more of it. Instead, they should be showing that we will all stand together for free speech. If the media had published the Danish cartoons back in 2005, this would never have become an issue. The submission by media, entertainment and academic elites empowered the savages.  The Southern Poverty Law Center included you on their list of “hate groups.” Are they right?  Of course not. They’re the hate group, using that label to demonize and stigmatize all who don’t share their hard-left agenda. The SPLC smear machine does not profile jihad groups, but they target and libel patriots, veterans, Tea Party organizations and other groups that work in defense of freedom. They named [Republican presidential contender] Ben Carson as a hate group. That should tell you everything you need to know about them. Their [sympathizers] have violently attacked family groups, and one tried to assassinate Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council.

711,2124,10,17,2017,2017-10-17,Vox,He left the NFL and is becoming a cop — but says the NFL protests over police brutality have a point,"Cameron Gordon has seen both sides of the NFL protests. In 2015, he won the Super Bowl with the New England Patriots, and retired a couple of seasons later. Now, in 2017, he expects to graduate from the 133rd Recruit Class of the Michigan State Police by the end of November.  So his take on the national anthem protests is particularly illuminating: “I like the discussion that it’s caused,” he told Politico.  Gordon’s take on the protests, in which NFL players typically kneel or lock arms instead of standing for the national anthem before games to protest racial inequality and police brutality, is nuanced:  What they’re saying is, “We don’t feel a part of America and we’re submitting to the flag.” Which is saying: “I want to have those equal rights, I want to feel as though I’m being treated equally when I’m pulled over in a stop or when I’m in need of help.” I don’t want to feel as if I’m a criminal in every instance I run into law enforcement. … All law enforcement is not perfect. There’s bad apples. Just like athletes. I know how athletes are. All athletes aren’t perfect. … When the whole domestic violence thing was coming out, I was getting looked at as a person who was, you know, hitting women or something. And I was like, “No, that’s not the case. Everyone’s not like that.” Just like the blemishes that police officers are getting right now.  Ultimately, though, Gordon concluded that if he were still in the NFL, “There’s probably a good chance that I would take a knee. Yeah. And me being in law enforcement now, that’s why I’m torn, because I know why. I feel like I know why, and that’s because people want to be treated fairly. Like ‘Hey, can I be a part of something that I don’t feel like I’m a part of?’ and that’s … basic constitutional rights.”  Gordon’s point, in short, is that the protests do have a legitimate grievance — and he can understand that even as a soon-to-be-cop whose brother is also a police officer in Detroit.  President Donald Trump, however, has characterized the protests as an affront to the flag, military, and country. As Trump said — to wild applause — at a rally, “Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field’?” Trump later said his criticisms of the protests have nothing to do with race, but are instead about “respect for our country and respect for our flag.” He has particularly focused on how taking a knee is, in his view, disrespectful to military veterans.  Gordon disagreed: “There’s no reason why veterans should get mad at them taking a knee. I feel personally there’s no reason because veterans go across overseas to fight for our rights. That’s no different than what they’re trying to do in a peaceful way, and they have the right to do so. Taking a knee, it’s a silent protest. They’re not burning anything up. They’re not tearing anything up. It’s a way to start a conversation, and it’s different than what you typically see on television.”  This lines up more with what the actual protesters have said. Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who started the demonstrations last year, reportedly worked with Nate Boyer, a former NFL player who was previously a US Army Green Beret, to avoid offending military veterans. And Kaepernick was clear that his goal was to protest police brutality and racial inequality, not the country or military as a whole.  “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,” Kaepernick said during his original protests. “To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.”  For more on the NFL protests, read Vox’s explainer.

He knows that Obamacare made many of their situations worse for many of them who were lied to about keeping their plans and doctors. They are without care.

""Apple let him go,"" Peterson said in the video, after detailing that her original video went viral and became one of YouTube's top trending videos after it was posted.

The original video, which has since been taken down, showed off new features of the iPhone X, including using Apple Pay, shots from inside Apple's cafeteria and even shots of Bauer, who handed the phone to Peterson in the video.  On his LinkedIn page, Bauer, who previously worked at Broadcom before coming to Apple in August 2013, was a self-described ""RF guy"" at Apple.

""I'm going to get on the phone with someone,"" Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN), who played a key role negotiating the sanctions bill as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters on Wednesday. The bill was a direct punishment for Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election.  The law, which passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress and which Trump signed into law in early August, required the administration to identify which Russian entities would be penalized with new sanctions by October 1. They still have not done so. The State Department has said it is “working to complete the process and provide the public guidance to the relevant people just as soon as possible.”  Republicans have stopped short of claiming that the administration’s delays have been strategic. ""We're going to check into it,” Corker said. “I don't have any way of evaluating whether it's purposeful or not purposeful.""  But it’s no secret that Trump, who has emphasized wanting a warmer relationship with Russia, did not want to sign the bill into law — and did so grudgingly. At the time, he released a statement claiming he is much better at dealmaking than Congress is and angrily tweeted that Republican lawmakers were ruining his relationship with Russia.  Congressional leaders did their due diligence to make sure the administration was aware the legislative branch was tracking the progress of the bill. Sens. John McCain (R-AZ) and Ben Cardin (D-MD) wrote the president a letter the day before the deadline to press him to fully enact the sanctions bill.  They expressed concern “that Russia may attempt to work around sanctions by funneling the arms trade through companies not included in the administration’s guidance,"" the senators wrote, and also emphasized working with European allies to coordinate sanctions.  At the time of the sanction bill’s passing it was largely considered to be a clear act of checks and balances in Washington, taking the sanctions decision out of Trump’s hands.

446,1795,10,9,2017,2017-10-09,The New York Times,Trump’s Argument Against Immigrants: We’ve Heard It Before,"Now here is Mr. Trump, who built his presidential run on a promise to build a border wall, and who began his campaign by attacking Mexico as supposedly an exporter of rapists and other criminals. As in 1994 California, the anger is directed powerfully at those arriving without documentation. Last month, though suggesting he was open to compromise, the president announced he would end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, the Obama-era program that protected immigrants who were brought to this country illegally as children.  The Trump assault, however, extends to all forms of immigration. In August, he embraced proposals to cut lawful entries in half over the next decade. Preference would be given to people possessing special skills and higher education — hardly the tired, the poor and the wretched refuse embraced in “The New Colossus,” the Emma Lazarus poem affixed to Miss Liberty’s base.  Two weeks ago, Trump administration officials disclosed their intention to cap refugee admissions at 45,000 over the next year. That would be the lowest ceiling, by far, since a 1980 law gave the president authority to help set limits on those searching for a haven from persecution in their own countries.  Surveys show that Mr. Trump’s “America first” sloganeering helped him eke out victories in November in critical swing states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, where some longer-term residents are uncomfortable with rising numbers of Latino newcomers. Sudden diversity is rarely simple. For some, it is scary.  But California in the wake of Proposition 187 may point to where the country as a whole is headed. The most populous state has undergone a profound demographic shift since the mid-1990s. Latinos now have a plurality; they and Asian-Americans combined are the majority. Non-Hispanic whites account for less than 40 percent.  As the video shows, Latinos in California are registering to vote in ever larger numbers, though whites are still more likely to go to the polls. The Latino representation in the legislature grows as well, to include prominent figures like State Senator Kevin de León. He said that many Californians, and not just Latinos, have had “enough with the scapegoating” of certain ethnic groups whenever the state has economic or other troubles.  Now California is cerulean blue politically, and there lies a cautionary tale for Republicans. With demographics changing almost everywhere, they may yet find that the short-term gain of the Trump 2016 victory comes at their long-term expense.

Tim Kaine, D-Va., Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., speak informally on tax reform and the elections with reporters in the Senate Press Gallery at the Capitol in Washington. It’s an article of faith among Republicans that the GOP’s electoral fortunes next year hinge on whether they succeed in their longstanding dream to redraft the nation’s complex, inefficient tax code. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)  WASHINGTON (AP) — It’s an article of faith among Republicans — reinforced by the party’s drubbing in this week’s off-year elections in Virginia and New Jersey — that the GOP’s electoral fortunes next year hinge on whether they succeed in their longstanding dream to redraft the nation’s complex, inefficient tax code.  Without a win on tax reform, the argument goes, Republicans are sunk in next year’s midterm elections. Core Republican voters and donors would lose faith. GOP lawmakers would have few accomplishments to run on.  “One of the things you do have to do is pass the things that you ran on,” said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., former chair of the campaign committee for House Republicans. “The other side is already whipped up. There’s nothing you can do about that. But your own side loses faith and you get a depressed turnout. If you don’t get them done, you’re guaranteed a bad midterm.”  The head of the Republican National Committee, Ronna Romney McDaniel, said GOP voters are looking to see what Congress can achieve.  “I can’t say that’s going to be the make-or-break of 2018,” she said, adding that Republicans are “facing headwinds in the coming midterms.”  “I think it’s important that we get this done,” she added.  Democrats agree that failure on tax reform would be a political disaster for Republicans. But passing the coveted tax measure wouldn’t necessarily save them from a bad midterm. The downside risk of failure, both sides say, far exceeds the upside reward.  “Without tax reform I think we’re in the minority,” said Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho. “But that doesn’t mean it’ll save us by any stretch of the imagination. I think yesterday kind of demonstrated that.”  The pending House bill, little understood by the public, performs poorly in public opinion polls. Voters are generally unenthusiastic about tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy and are skeptical that they’ll see a tax cut.  An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll taken last month found that people by large margins believe the Trump-backed tax plan helps wealthy people and corporations. Just over four in 10 in the poll said they believe that it helps middle-income individuals and families, slightly more than the number who thinks it hurts them.  Losing Virginia GOP gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie ran on a promise of across-the-board tax cuts that failed to catch on.  “We had an experiment on tax cut politics in Virginia through Ed Gillespie’s campaign. And the tax cut gambit really fell flat,” said Geoff Garin of Hart Research, lead pollster for the campaign of the Democratic governor-elect, Ralph Northam. “If the Republicans think somehow that tax cut politics will heal their problems of having to run with Donald Trump and all the damage they’ve already done to themselves on health care, the laboratory experiment we had in Virginia yesterday makes it very clear that that will not happen for them.”  The tax measure, at least as currently drafted by House Republicans, would impose tax increases on many of the affluent suburban voters who just turned against Republicans not only in Virginia, but in New Jersey and New York’s Westchester and Nassau Counties. The measure would repeal a number of deductions cherished by upper middle-income taxpayers, including the state income tax deduction, while limiting the deductibility of mortgage interest on home loans exceeding $500,000.  “Look, it’s a lose-lose for them,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. “I think even if they pass the bill, as people learn all the things that are taken away it’s going to hurt them. But I think if they can’t pass a bill their ability to get things done is questioned, even by the deep Trump supporters. So it’s a lose-lose.”  Schumer has been urging Republicans to follow the model of the successful 1986 tax reform bill, in which former President Ronald Reagan worked with both Democrats and Republicans to gore special interest provisions while lowering tax rates.  Two weeks after Reagan signed the bill, however, Republicans suffered a drubbing in the 1986 midterms, losing control of the Senate with an eight-seat loss.  In the aftermath of Tuesday’s drubbing, Republicans sought to portray an air of calm, cautioning against reading too much into the results in two states — Virginia and New Jersey — that went for Democrat Hillary Clinton in last year’s election. They said that passage of their tax overhaul bill would pay off.  “I think that’s going to bear fruit politically, but most importantly it’s going to help people,” said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., at a Wednesday morning event held by The Washington Examiner. “If anything, this just puts more pressure on making sure we follow through.”  Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said of Virginia: “I see it as a blue state staying blue.”  ___  Associated Press writer Tom Beaumont in Des Moines, Iowa, contributed to this report.",2.8333333333333335,6,"[0.5, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.5]"

315,1651,10,6,2017,2017-10-06,Vox,What Trump’s Access Hollywood tape reveals about Harvey Weinstein and men in power,"On October 7, 2016, the Washington Post released a videotape of Donald Trump and Billy Bush hanging out on a bus.  “You know, I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them,” Trump said on the tape, filmed in 2005 when Bush was an Access Hollywood host and Trump was hosting The Apprentice. “It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait.”  “When you’re a star, they let you do it,” Trump continued, as Bush laughed. “Grab ’em by the pussy. You can do anything.”  In the year since the tape was released, we’ve seen several powerful men accused of the kind of behavior Trump described — Harvey Weinstein is just the latest. Many women have come forward to talk about their experiences, and as many have pointed out, it’s a hopeful sign that they’ve been able to come forward at all. But before we tell ourselves our society is no longer safe for harassers, let’s remember what happened to Donald Trump after he essentially bragged about assaulting women: almost nothing.  After the tape was released, Billy Bush had to leave Today, where he had been a host. Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) withdrew his endorsement of Trump. “As the father of three daughters,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said, “I strongly believe that Trump needs to apologize directly to women and girls everywhere.”  Trump did apologize, saying, “anyone who knows me knows these words don’t reflect who I am.” Beyond some public embarrassment, however, he faced few real repercussions. Despite his comments on the tape, despite the women who later said he had actually done some of what he bragged about, and despite a litany of racist and sexist comments made in public for all to see, Trump is now president of the United States. On Friday, his administration released regulations significantly weakening the contraceptive coverage mandate, thereby threatening birth control access for women and girls around the country.  Meanwhile, on Thursday, the New York Times published an exposé detailing multiple allegations of sexual harassment against the producer Harvey Weinstein, some of them recent and some dating back decades. According to the Hollywood Reporter, another such exposé is in the works at the New Yorker. The allegations appear to match rumors that have been circulating about Weinstein for years, as Vox’s Constance Grady notes. Weinstein has apologized, and has retained a “team of people,” including therapists and Lisa Bloom, a lawyer who has represented victims of sexual harassment. He has also promised to sue the Times.  It’s not clear what consequences Weinstein will face for his alleged harassment. According to the Times, he is planning to take a leave of absence from the Weinstein Company, of which he and his brother together own 42 percent. He has also said he plans to campaign against the National Rifle Association and that he is making a film about the president.  It can feel cathartic to see allegations that swirled for so long beneath the surface finally made public. At the same time, stories like Weinstein’s are a reminder that harassment by powerful men too often goes unchecked for years, decades, a lifetime. Many women have responded to the Times story with stories of their own of men who got away with too much for too long. As writer Ann Friedman put it on Twitter, “every industry has at least one of these powerful creeps. Look around. Do you know who the Weinstein is?”  At the Cut, Rebecca Traister argues that “something has changed” in our culture, as women increasingly come forward to say publicly what they once might have whispered among themselves. But she also notes that the allegations against Weinstein have only become public now that he has “lost power in the movie industry, is no longer the titan of independent film, the indie mogul who could make or break an actor’s Oscar chances.”  “Perhaps only a weakening of Weinstein’s grip permitted his expensive self-crafted armor to finally be pierced,” she writes.  Some men in power — Traister mentions Bill O’Reilly and Bill Cosby — have been brought low (or at least lower, as Cosby has so far avoided jail time) by accusations of harassment and assault. Many others remain.  The infamous Access Hollywood video doesn’t end with Trump’s comments about grabbing women “by the pussy.” It continues for several minutes, as Bush and Trump exit the bus and walk with actress Arianne Zucker to the set of the soap opera Days of Our Lives. On the bus, the two men can be heard discussing Zucker’s attractiveness, and Trump says, “I’ve got to use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her.” Off the bus, in her presence, the men are more polite, but as the three interact, the viewer gets a glimpse of what many women have to deal with every day.  First Bush requests that Zucker give each of them a hug. Later, Bush asks her to choose: Who would she pick, he asks, “if you had to take one of us as a date?”  “I’ll have to take the Fifth on that one,” she says.  This is all pretty tame compared with Trump’s earlier comments, or with some of the allegations against Weinstein. But it’s an example of the kind of low-grade harassment women put up with — and respond to with a smile — all the time. It’s telling that Zucker said last year that she was unsurprised to hear what Trump was saying about her and other women behind her back. “With that type of personality, I wasn’t shocked,” she said.  Countless women continue to go to work and put up with sexist jokes, unwanted hugs, comments that make them uncomfortable, small incidents that may be easy to brush off individually but that become a constant drain on women’s productivity, drive, and joy. Some of those women will experience larger incidents of harassment or assault, the kinds of encounters that allegedly left at least one assistant to Weinstein in tears.  Some will speak up about what happened to them. We can hope the country is becoming a safer place for women to do that; we can work to make it safer. At the same time, we have to acknowledge that last year, the nation heard a man bragging on tape about assaulting women, and this year he is our president.  “When you’re a star, they let you do it,” Trump said in 2005. He seemed to be talking about the women he said he liked to kiss without warning. But his words also apply to American voters, who heard exactly what this powerful man thought of women — who heard women say these were not just thoughts, but actions — and who decided to let it go.",0.5,1,[0.5]

The event takes place on the anniversary of the election that put Trump in the White House. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya)  DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Marking a year since President Donald Trump’s election, his fiercest advocates offered different approaches Wednesday for the Republican Party’s way forward after some tough losses Tuesday.  Appearing in key states Trump carried a year ago, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer and Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel called on Republicans to come together, while former White House strategist Steve Bannon maintained an aggressive tone toward any in the GOP who would stand in the president’s way.  Their remarks in Iowa and Michigan underscored the tension bubbling over in Washington.  “Let me tell you, there is a stark difference between the worst Republican and the best Democrat,” Spicer said during the Republican Party of Iowa’s annual Reagan Dinner in Des Moines.  Spicer lamented Republicans in Virginia who decided not to vote Tuesday for GOP gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie because he didn’t pass their “litmus tests.”  Bannon, meanwhile, took aim at veteran Republican lawmakers and entrenched party insiders, whom he has pledged to root out of the Senate next year. He grouped Gillespie — a lobbyist, former RNC chairman and adviser to former President George W. Bush — with the GOP forces of old.  Trump needs more outsiders at his side, Bannon said.  “He’s had some victories. He’s had some defeats,” Bannon said of Trump. “Most of the defeats are because the Republican establishment cannot execute on the plan.”  Bannon spoke at a Republican dinner in Macomb County, Michigan, a working-class Detroit suburb which former President Barack Obama carried twice but where Trump handily beat Democrat Hillary Clinton last year.  Despite Trump’s low approval ratings — 33 percent in a Gallup poll this week, the lowest of his presidency — McDaniel, who also spoke at the Iowa banquet, painted an optimistic picture of the economy, touted record party fundraising and said, “I feel very confident in the candidates I see running across the country.”  “I hope we expand our majority in the Senate so we can get more things done,” she said.  However, Bannon has pledged to find primary opponents for virtually every Republican senator standing for re-election next year, arguing they have not adequately defended Trump against attacks from within his own party, chiefly by Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker and Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake.  With Corker and Flake having announced plans to not seek re-election, Bannon is gunning for GOP Sen. Dean Heller in Nevada and has even mentioned challenging reliable conservatives such as John Barrasso of Wyoming and Deb Fischer of Nebraska.  One of Bannon’s chief goals is ousting Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, whom he blames for not following through on long-promised legislation to undo Obama’s 2010 health care law.  “They only understand one thing. You cannot be nice to these guys,” Bannon said, referring to McConnell. “You have to drop the hammer.

1437,3057,11,5,2017,2017-11-05,Breitbart,Gillespie Possibly Surging over Northam in Final Days of Virginia Governor’s Race,"Republican Ed Gillespie and Democrat Ralph Northam are virtually tied in the race for Virginia governor, but with signs that Gillespie may have come from behind to take the edge in the campaign’s final days.  Both candidates are focusing on issues that drive their respective party bases in a test of whether the Old Dominion has swung to the left, or can return to its center-right balance.  For much of the campaign, Gillespie has focused on bread-and-butter issues that Republicans typically use to persuade swing voters, talking about job creation, economic growth, reducing regulations, and improving education and health care. He was also running behind Northam for much of the campaign, despite the fact that Gillespie is a very seasoned and capable political strategist and campaigner.  Once a reliably red state, Virginia has trended sharply left in recent years, going for Barack Obama twice, and for Tim Kaine as governor and then as senator. The state also went for Hillary Clinton over President Donald Trump. Northam’s lead over Gillespie seemed due to this strong leftward current, given that Gillespie is a better candidate and his stand on swing-voter issues did better in the polls.  But in recent days, Gillespie has tapped into several of the issues that led to Republican victories in 2016, most notably Donald Trump’s nationwide victory with more Electoral College votes than any Republican since 1988.  Gillespie has come out swinging on immigration, hitting Northam hard for being soft on crime with an ad, “Left Wing Ralph Northam,” that explained, “MS-13 is a menace, yet Ralph Northam voted in favor of sanctuary cities that let dangerous illegal immigrants back on the street, increasing the threat of MS-13.”  Pushing back against the Far Left, Gillespie has also rallied to the defense of Virginia’s historical figures and monuments. Northam has said all of these statues and monuments must come down. In late October, a church in Alexandria, Virginia, where George Washington once attended has removed its plaque honoring America’s first president, showing how far that political movement has gone.  The Republican candidate has also been touting his support for the Second Amendment and pro-life causes, among other conservative priorities. The National Rifle Association—which is headquartered in Fairfax, Virginia—has also weighed in, pushing hard for Gillespie because of his support for gun owners.  On the other side of the ballot, Northam’s tactics have gotten desperate over the two weeks, corresponding to his lead evaporating.  Northam’s allies sparked national outrage recently, when the Latino Victory Fund ran an ad showing a pickup truck with a Gillespie bumper sticker running down children of color in the streets. A consensus has emerged that this ad is the most despicable low-blow of the entire 2017 election cycle, outraging voters and possibly backfiring on Northam’s campaign.

1049,2627,10,26,2017,2017-10-26,Fox News,Kaspersky Lab says it 'inadvertently' downloaded NSA hacking tools,"Embattled security firm Kaspersky Lab said its antivirus software did download secret hacking tools from a US computer back in 2014, but deleted them after realizing the data was classified.  ""The archive was deleted from all our systems. The archive was not shared with any third parties,"" Kaspersky Lab said on Tuesday.  The Moscow-based security firm has been fighting accusations that its antivirus software helped Russian spies steal confidential files from the US National Security Agency. On Tuesday, Kaspersky Lab tried to clear the air, and said its antivirus software did indeed download the secret hacking files, but only because they were flagged as malware after an NSA contractor's home computer was reportedly infected.  ""US law tolerates inadvertent acquisition of classified data, but doesn't allow to distribute it. We deleted it to follow the law,"" the company's CEO Eugene Kaspersky tweeted on Wednesday. The Russian security firm added: ""Kaspersky Lab has never created any detection of non-weaponized (non-malicious) documents in its products based on keywords like 'top secret' and 'classified'.""  In a statement, the security firm provided a timeline detailing how Kaspersky Lab came across the classified files, which seems to point the finger at the careless behavior of the NSA contractor.  In 2014, Kaspersky was investigating a shadowy hacking group called Equation, which experts now believe is actually the NSA. Ultimately, Equation Group hacking tools ended up in the hands of a group known as the Shadow Brokers, which reportedly has links to Russia.  As part of its investigation into the Equation Group, Kaspersky's antivirus software detected some unknown malicious code in a 7-zip archive on a US home computer. The archive was then uploaded to Kaspersky Lab for analysis, and was found to contain an arsenal of hacking tools.  According to Kaspersky Lab, the computer in question at one point downloaded and installed pirated software that contained a separate piece of malware called ""Backdoor.Win32.Mokes.hvl."" Kaspersky's software flagged it as malicious. However, to get the pirated software to run, the computer's user disabled Kaspersky's antivirus product. The computer was then infected with a backdoor that Kaspersky Lab says can give a hacker remote control over the system.  Kaspersky Lab isn't sure how long the computer was infected with the backdoor. But its software first detected its presence on Oct. 4 2014, with a final detection on Nov. 17 of that year. It's also unclear who may have been in control of the backdoor.  Jake Williams, founder of US cybersecurity firm Rendition InfoSec, said ""I think the story Kaspersky has laid out is completely plausible.""  It'll be up to the US government to back up its own claims against Kaspersky, he added. ""And they need to back their claims with data, not just accusations,"" Williams said.  Many of the accusations against Kaspersky have come from media reports that largely cite anonymous sources. Nevertheless, the US Department of Homeland Security is forcing federal agencies to stop using the company's antivirus software. Retailers such as Best Buy have also dropped Kaspersky Lab products from store shelves.  In response, Kaspersky Lab has offered up an independent review of the company's source code for flaws.

759,2174,10,18,2017,2017-10-18,Fox News,American Express CEO Kenneth Chenault to retire next year,"Kenneth Chenault, one of the most prominent black corporate leaders and long-time chairman and CEO of American Express, is stepping down next year, the company announced Wednesday.  Chenault, 66, will be replaced on Feb. 1 by Stephen Squeri, who will take over as both American Express' CEO and chairman of the board. Squeri, 58, is currently vice chairman at American Express.  Chenault took over as CEO in 2001 and guided the company through several seismic events, including the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. The company's headquarters in Manhattan is next door to the site of the World Trade Center, and it was severely damaged in the attack.  He also led the company through the financial crisis and subsequent Great Recession of 2008. While American Express did not hold any mortgages, its direct exposure to the health of the U.S. consumer put significant pressure on its business.  The company had to convert itself to a bank-holding company to access the Federal Reserve's emergency lending programs. It also became much more tightly regulated after the crisis, having to go through the Fed's annual ""stress tests"" like its bigger bank competitors like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America.  But Chenault's biggest challenge in his tenure would be new and fierce competition for its highly coveted, wealthy card members and credit card users.  Citigroup and Visa Inc. were able to steal away American Express' long-time customer Costco two years ago, which was a major blow to the company since Costco represented one of AmEx's biggest co-brand partnerships.  Meanwhile, Chase launched a new credit card called the Chase Sapphire Reserve Card that became a blockbuster hit and AmEx saw some of its Platinum Card customers jump ship to Chase. It caused other companies to announced their own ""me too"" high fee, high reward cards focused on going after AmEx's customers.  However AmEx pushed back, upping the rewards and perks of the card and has been able to retain at least a majority of those customers.  ""We have faced three major challenges and the reality is we have emerged stronger than we were before,"" Chenault said in an interview.  Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor and largest shareholder of American Express through his company Berkshire Hathaway, praised Chenault's performance.  ""Ken's been the gold standard for corporate leadership and the benchmark that I measure others against,"" Buffett said in a statement.  Squeri joined American Express in 1985 in the company's once well-known Travelers Cheques division. He rose through the ranks not in American Express' consumer card business, but through the company's merchant and commercial business divisions, working to get companies to use American Express' corporate cards and getting merchants to join its payment network.  The announcement came as American Express announced its third-quarter results. The company posted a profit of $1.36 billion, or $1.50 a share, compared with $1.14 billion, or $1.20 per share, in the same period a year earlier. The results beat analysts' expectations, who were looking for American Express to post a profit of $1.48 a share in the latest quarter.  The results were fueled by a noticeable rise in card member spending, and higher interest rates on balances customers were keeping on the cards. Unlike its competition, American Express makes most of its money on the fees it charges merchants to accept their credit and charge cards, the latter required to be paid off at the end of the each month.  The company did see a slight rise in the number of delinquencies and had to set aside additional funds to cover potential bad loans. However because AmEx primarily serves the well-to-do, its losses tend to be lower than the rest of the industry.",3.6320754716981134,53,"[5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 1.5, 4.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.0, 5.0, 3.5, 3.0, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 0.5, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 2.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.5, 3.0, 1.5, 4.0, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0, 2.0, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 2.5, 2.0, 0.5, 0.5, 5.0, 5.0, 2.5]"

1070,2648,10,27,2017,2017-10-27,Vox,Scotland may ban spanking. Decades of research suggests that’s a good idea.,"Last week, a member of the Scottish Parliament introduced legislation that would make spanking a crime on par with assault. And the Scottish National Party, which controls the Scottish Parliament, has pledged to make it law sometime early in 2018, Scotland’s national newspaper reports.  When that happens, Scotland will join a growing list of counties, states, and municipalities that have made hitting children illegal. Since Sweden became the first country to ban corporeal punishment in 1979, 51 other countries have adopted similar laws. (The United States is not among them.)  Current law in Scotland (and in the UK at large) allows for “reasonable chastisement” (yes, it’s vague) when it comes to disciplining kids. This new legislation would make Scotland the first UK country to turn that gray area into a fine black line.  “Giving children equal protection against assault will send a clear message to all of us about how we treat each other and underpin Scotland’s efforts to reduce violence,” John Finnie, the member of the Scottish Parliament who introduced the law, told reporters.  Opponents say that spanking — generally defined as hitting a child with an open hand on the behind — leads to a slippery slope of abuse and can cause emotional and behavioral problems down the line. The question of whether mild spanking definitely causes problems is hard to answer. (You can’t exactly run an experiment that involves hitting children.)  Here’s the state of the science. There’s not a lot of evidence that spanking provides a benefit to kids. And there’s some (controversial and contested) evidence that it can actually lead to harm.  The state of the science on spanking  In a 2016 meta-analysis in the Journal of Family Psychology, psychologists Elizabeth Gershoff and Andrew Grogan-Kaylor sifted through 75 studies on spanking, excluding research that analyzed other forms of physical punishment and abuse, such as hitting children with objects. The studies employed either cross-sectional (i.e., snapshot) or longitudinal (over the span of several years) designs. In all, the resulting data pool contained information on 161,000 children. It found “no evidence that spanking is associated with improved child behavior.”  The analysis found evidence that spanking is associated with troubling outcomes — like increased aggression, increased antisocial behavior, and mental health problems later in life. According to Gershoff, spanking “makes it clear to the children that you can hit somebody if you have power.” And that lesson sticks with a kid, making them act out later in life.  There are a lot of big caveats to mention here.  The size of these negative effects is small, the study notes, and there's no proof that spanking specifically caused these behaviors later in life. So it’s hard to tell if spanking leaves a lasting scar.  And the evidence in the broader literature is mixed. A 2013 meta-review on corporal punishment in kids found “trivial” correlations with negative outcomes. But a 2017 analysis in the journal Child Abuse & Neglect found in a correlational study that spanking was linked to similar adverse effects as childhood emotional abuse.  The research is not perfectly clear because behaviors like spanking are some of the hardest for social scientists to study and draw concrete conclusions from.  For one, researchers can't conduct spanking experiments where they randomly assign children to be hit. They also have to lean on questionnaires, where parents or children have to remember how punishments were administered.  There’s also the case that ""bad"" children are just spanked more, and are also generally more aggressive and antisocial throughout their lives. And even though this meta-analysis singled out studies only about spanking, it’s still possible the parents in these studies were also using harsher forms of punishment (like hitting children with objects) and didn’t mention it to the researchers.  Overall, when studying real-world behaviors like spanking, it’s very hard, if not impossible, to truly isolate the variable and study its absolute effect on behavior.  “Gershoff and Grogan-Kaylor’s most recent meta-analysis relies on correlational evidence that would be considered woefully inadequate in any other scientific field,” the American College of Pediatricians wrote in an scathing editorial bashing the meta-review. They said that “studies would be rejected if they were being used to halt a medical procedure, such as chemotherapy for combating cancer.” To reiterate: You just can’t study spanking like you could a drug.  The editorial noted only four of the studies limited the definition of spanking to “two open-handed swats to the buttocks for child defiance.” The other studies left the term “spanking” a bit more open to interpretation: They could mean smacks anywhere on the body. Then again, parents who hit their children might not be mindful of these differing definitions, or may use them interchangeably.  Bob Larzelere, the Oklahoma State University family science researcher who co-authored the College of Pediatricians editorial, says in an email that there are a few studies that show something called “conditional spanking,” where children only get spanked if they ignore another mild discipline (like a time out) may be effective in getting children to cooperate. Though the research on this disciplinary technique is unclear as to whether mild “conditional” spanking leads to a slippery slope of increasing violence, or whether it has long-term consequences for a child’s well-being.  At the very least, the 2016 meta-study makes a case that spanking doesn't lead to any long-term measurable good. Only one study of the 75 studies found an effect linking spanking to a positive life outcome. “If — in the real world — spanking was good for kids, some of these studies should have found that,” Gershoff told Vox in 2016.  Why parents spank  In 2016, I spoke with Gershoff in depth about her research. And I asked her why we assume spanking could be a helpful disciplinary strategy. “One is parents think it works,” she said. “And they think it works because it gets an immediate reaction out of the child. Immediately the child cries. The parent goes ""Aha! they understood that I am mad."" That’s gratifying to the parent, so the parent is rewarded by getting this reaction out of the child.”  The other reason: Parents themselves were spanked themselves as children, and are continuing the practice. But Gershoff didn’t think parents today should necessarily feel guilty for spanking their kids.  “We know now that children need to be in carseats and seat belts,” she said. “But those of us who grew up in the 1970s were in cars that didn't even have seat belts. Do I think my parents were bad parents for not putting me in a seat belt? No, because no one understood how important seat belts were.”  Even if the effect of spanking is null — not positive or negative — why should (however mildly) violent actions be condoned? The world over, children are routinely the subjects of violent abuse; the United Nations finds domestic violence is a leading cause of children’s deaths worldwide. And many argue that spanking is the first step on a continuum of violence. If a hand slap is good, why isn’t a rod better? It’s a dangerous slippery slope.",3.142857142857143,14,"[3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.0, 5.0, 3.0, 3.5, 5.0, 2.5, 1.5, 2.0, 0.5, 3.5]"

In an interview with Bloomberg, General Raymond called Earth’s orbital space “congested, contested and competitive” and claimed that “all three of those trends are trending upward.” He sees a “full range of threats” to national security interests, global positioning systems, and communications satellites.  The sources of those threats are many and varied, from rivals like China or Russia to over 20,000 pieces of dangerous debris threatening active orbital platforms on a daily basis. At any given time, the world’s more than 1,400 satellites are in danger of being destroyed by nothing more than this space garbage. With the U.S. effectively serving as “the space traffic control of the world,” some 400,000 observations are made every day by Space Command. Now, the threat of the intentional destruction of these vital technological support systems is moving into the spotlight.  General Raymond asserted that “our goal is not to have conflict in space” and he wants “to deter that conflict from happening.” Still, he believes that “it’s a war-fighting domain, and we need to treat it as such.” He used China’s 2007 termination of one of its own satellites to illustrate the possibility of that danger. The Pentagon seems to support this claim, saying that China “continues to develop a variety of counter-space capabilities designed to limit or to prevent the use of space-based assets.”  Russia is making many similar moves to tighten security and prepare for the possibilities of extra-planetary warfare. According to the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, “Russia believes that having the military capabilities to counter space operations will deter aggression by space-enabled adversaries and enable Russia to control escalation of conflict if deterrence fails,” justified by Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin as a countermeasure to U.S. ballistic missile defense systems.  According to General Raymond, it is an ever-expanding concern. Spaceflight is growing more and more accessible, drastically increasing traffic just outside of our atmosphere. In the interview, he noted that “as of today, 86 launches have occurred worldwide this year. In 2001 that number was in the low 50s.”  In July, the House Armed Services Committee voted in favor of creating a new branch of the military to provide “combat-ready space forces that enable the commanders of the combatant commands to fight and win wars.”  Follow Nate Church @Get2Church on Twitter for the latest news in gaming and technology, and snarky opinions on both.",2.985294117647059,34,"[5.0, 4.5, 0.5, 3.0, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.0, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 2.0, 3.5, 2.5, 3.0, 1.5, 1.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 3.0, 1.0, 4.0, 2.0, 1.0, 3.5, 4.5, 4.0, 1.5, 1.5, 3.5, 3.0]"

The statement marks a significant walk-back of Trump’s campaign promise in 2016 to relocate the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem “fairly quickly.”  In March 2016, in a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a prominent pro-Israel lobby group, Trump committed to moving the embassy to Jerusalem, explaining that it would increase the chance of peace with the Palestinians:  But when the United States stands with Israel, the chances of peace really rise and rises exponentially. That’s what will happen when Donald Trump is president of the United States. We will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem. And we will send a clear signal that there is no daylight between America and our most reliable ally, the state of Israel. The Palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the United States and Israel is absolutely, totally unbreakable. They must come to the table willing and able to stop the terror being committed on a daily basis against Israel. They must do that. And they must come to the table willing to accept that Israel is a Jewish state and it will forever exist as a Jewish state.  In his interview with Huckabee, Trump appeared to dump that logic in favor of the conventional wisdom that the chances for peace would be hurt by affirming Israel’s sovereignty in Jerusalem.  Huckabee: Ambassador [David] Friedman recently indicated that the embassy will be moved to Jerusalem. Do we have a timeframe? Trump: Well, we’re going to make a decision in the not-too-distant future. Right now, we are actually working on a plan that everybody says will never work — because for many, many years, it’s never worked, they say it’s the toughest deal of all, is peace between Israel and the Palestinians. So we’re going to work that, and if that doesn’t work — which is possible that it won’t, to be totally honest, I mean most people say it’s an impossible deal. I don’t think it is impossible, and I think it’s something that can happen. And I think it’s something that — I’m not making any predictions, but I want to give that a shot before I even think about moving the embassy to Jerusalem.  Trump appears to consider the embassy move a punitive measure, one that Palestinians can forestall by indulging peace talks. The implication is that an embassy move might not be included within the framework of a peace deal, and that Palestinians might not be required to recognize Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem in a peace agreement.

For Mexico’s part, a top priority remains finding ways to incorporate President Enrique Peña Nieto’s 2014 energy program in a modernized Nafta. This would further open up Mexico’s energy sector to private investment and could reduce the United States’ trade deficit with Mexico.  While many details remain to be worked out, the course of the Nafta talks is also likely to be directed by politics and the passions of Mr. Trump. The decision on Tuesday by Mr. Trump to end the Obama-era executive action that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation could ratchet up tension between the countries. And Mr. Trump’s ongoing commitment to making Mexico finance a border wall rankles its leaders.  “It is hard to reconcile the political language of the U.S. leaders and their aggressiveness and their sense of being abused by Mexico in the relationship,” said Alejandro Gómez-Strozzi, Mexico’s undersecretary of economy from 2000 to 2006. “Nafta needs some improvement, but not in the light that is being portrayed by the U.S. president.”  Mr. Trump may have to decide if he wants to tweak the deal and call it a win, get bogged down in painstaking details or bail on Nafta entirely.  Most trade experts agree that achieving a major rewrite of Nafta in the next few months is a long shot, if only because most major trade pacts take years to reach. To veterans of big trade agreements, the lack of immediate breakthroughs is not necessarily bad news for Nafta, but the urge to rush the negotiations could prove to be counterproductive.  “As you’re thinking about the timetable, you need to make sure you have enough time to consult with Congress, consult with stakeholders and find creative solutions to new problems,” said Michael Froman, who was a trade representative under President Barack Obama.",2.5,2,"[3.5, 1.5]"
818,2251,10,16,2017,2017-10-16,Vox,"What's so cool about the neutron star kilonova astronomers discovered, in 500 words"," ripples in space and time — have changed the world, again. On Monday, a huge team of scientists working in collaboration with LIGO, the US-based gravitational wave observatory, and VIRGO, an observatory based in Italy, announced they had for the first time used gravitational waves to locate an object in the sky. Specifically, they found two neutron stars that had crashed into one another 130 million light-years away.  The discovery means we’re truly in a new age of astronomy: one in which scientists can listen for ripples in spacetime and figure out where to look in the universe to see amazing phenomena unfold in real time.  Here’s a brief rundown of why today’s announcement was so damn cool  For the first time, scientists have detected the gravitational waves that formed during the collision of two neutron stars.  At the same time the gravitational waves were detected, a space-based observatory recorded a gamma-ray burst. These are high-intensity beams of radiation that periodically blast through the universe like a strobe laser light. This confirms that binary neutron star collisions can create gamma-ray bursts, and that gamma rays and gravitational waves travel at the same speed, the speed of light — something Einstein correctly predicted 100 years ago.  The neutron stars collided 130 million years ago. But scientists were able, in a sense, to study the entirety of the event: from when the neutron stars were orbiting one another to the moment they crashed to the burning aftermath. (LIGO-VIRGO recorded 100 seconds of gravitational waves from the collision. Previous recordings of black holes only lasted a few seconds.)  When neutron stars collide, they produce an explosion called a kilonova, and astronomers have never witnessed one before. The kilonova produced the gamma-ray burst, but it also contained the right ingredients and energy needed to create heavy elements like gold, platinum, and uranium.  Now that there are three gravitational wave observatories up and running across the world (one in Louisiana, one in Washington state, and one in Italy), scientists can zero in on where in the sky the gravitational waves are coming from. They used this data to create a map of where to look for the kilonova and sent it to a worldwide network of astronomers. (All of this occurred within a 12-hour window.)  Astronomers found the kilonova that very night! And then they sent the exact coordinates to our biggest, baddest telescopes (Hubble, Chandra, and others).  Observations from those telescopes studied the light from the kilonova and how it evolved over the course of a few weeks. By reading the color of light from the kilonova, scientists figured out which elements it produced.  And lo and behold, it produced gold and platinum. That means all the gold on Earth was likely produced in a kilonova. With these observations, scientists were able to peek at a tiny slice of creation.  Also cool: Astronomers have now observed this kilonova in every wavelength of electromagnetic radiation, and in gravitational waves. No other event has been recorded so thoroughly.  And, all of this took the work of thousands of scientists (one of the papers published Monday has 4,500 co-authors!), working collaboratively, world over.

Instead, Einstein offered a tip in the form of his theory on how to have a happy life.  “A calm and modest life brings more happiness than the pursuit of success combined with constant restlessness,” he wrote in German on a piece of hotel stationery.  On a second sheet, he wrote, “Where there’s a will, there’s a way.”  Einstein told the bellboy, according to the auction house, that if he was lucky, the notes might become more valuable than a regular tip.

Questioned about North Korea on Monday, Mr. Tillerson and Mr. Mattis acknowledged that Congress had not granted any authority to Mr. Trump to start a war. Still, they said, he possessed constitutional authority as commander in chief to strike North Korea in the event of an imminent attack against the United States.  But Mr. Tillerson demurred when pressed to say whether North Korea’s mere possession of a nuclear weapon that could reach the United States would be sufficient to enable Mr. Trump to strike on his own. Mr. Tillerson said such questions could turn on the facts, including whether such a weapon was stored in a bunker or was sitting on a launching pad.  Several senators also pressed the witnesses about the recent deaths in Niger. Although Mr. Mattis said the purpose of the deployment there was to help build up national defenses because “the enemy is trying to move somewhere” as the Islamic State’s stronghold in Iraq and Syria collapsed, he said it was authorized under a separate law that allowed the military to carry out training and assistance missions.",3.2560975609756095,41,"[3.5, 1.0, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 4.5, 0.5, 4.0, 3.5, 1.5, 3.0, 4.5, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 2.0, 4.0, 1.0, 4.0, 3.5, 0.5, 3.0, 2.0, 4.5, 4.0, 0.5, 5.0, 4.0, 0.5, 5.0, 5.0]"

(AP Photo/Matt Dunham, Pool)  LONDON (AP) — British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has fueled speculation that he hopes to eventually succeed Prime Minister Theresa May by spelling out his Brexit goals days before her major policy speech on the topic.  Johnson, a former journalist, wrote a 4,000-word article in the Saturday edition of The Daily Telegraph newspaper to explain how Brexit can bring a “glorious” future to Britain and help it become “the greatest country on Earth.” He says Britain shouldn’t seek to stay in the European Union’s single market or the customs union, and should seize the opportunity to make its own way.  The timing of his Brexit broadside is important because May is scheduled to detail her own Brexit views at a much-touted speech in Italy on Sept. 22.  Johnson making his own views known first may be seen by many as a challenge to her authority, which has been weakened by a poor result in the June 8 election that cost her Conservative Party its majority in Parliament.  Johnson sought to quiet speculation later Saturday by tweeting: “All behind Theresa for a glorious Brexit.”  Johnson was an avid campaigner to have Britain leave the EU in the 2016 Brexit referendum.  He used the newspaper article to again raise the widely discredited idea that leaving the EU could allow Britain to add 350 million pounds ($475 million) a week to the National Health Service and argued that lifting regulations and reforming tax rules would allow Britain to prosper.  May has been able to hold onto her job despite her poor electoral performance, but has been facing increasing pressure as Brexit negotiations with the EU have stalled over the question of how much Britain must pay to leave the 28-nation bloc.  Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, whose opposition party fared well in the general election, said through a spokesman that Johnson’s Brexit views exposed the deep rifts within May’s Conservative government.  “Boris Johnson has laid bare the conflicts at the heart of Theresa May’s government over Brexit and cut the ground from beneath the prime minister’s authority,” Corbyn’s spokesman said. “In the process he has exposed the Tories’ real Brexit agenda — a race-to-the-bottom in regulation and corporate tax cuts to benefit the wealthy few at the expense of the rights of the rest of us.”",1.875,4,"[0.5, 3.0, 2.5, 1.5]"

The California state legislature has opposed Trump’s agenda by becoming a so-called sanctuary state, as well as trying to force him to release his tax returns and even passing a resolution calling for him to apologize for “racist and bigoted behavior.”  Feinstein, however, took criticism from the left in August for expressing the hope that Trump would change to be more cooperative with Democrats.  “I just hope he has the ability to learn and to change, and if he does, he can be a good president,” she said, receiving boos from the San Francisco audience. She later said she is “under no illusion that it’s likely to happen and will continue to oppose his policies.”  De León will likely be one of multiple contenders for Feinstein’s seat. A source said Democratic mega-donor and environmentalist Tom Steyer is “very much looking at the Senate race,” and in a letter Wednesday he also called on Democrats to impeach Trump.

The 52-year-old victim was a passenger on a Metro bus in the Washington, DC, suburb of Silver Spring, Maryland, when Marquis Evans-Royster, 27, began spitting in his face and hurling racial epithets at him, according to ABC in Washington.  The harassment began almost immediately after Evans-Royster boarded the bus without paying the fare, police said.  The victim, who is homeless and remains unnamed in reports, initially tried to ignore Evans-Royster’s taunts but finally tried to push the attacker away when he began to go through the victim’s pockets while yelling, “You owe me for making my grandmother a slave.”  When other passengers began to try and intervene to stop Evans-Royster from attacking the victim, the attacker threatened to douse them with urine.  The threat caused one bus rider to tell the media that Evans-Royster must also have some sort of mental problem. “Who carries around a bottle a urine?” bus rider Desi Cureton scoffed.  At length, the bus driver threatened to call police causing Evans-Royster to jump off the bus and run away.  Police identified Evans-Royster from bus surveillance video and he was arrested four days after the incident and charged with assault and racial harassment. The attacker already has a long police record including charges of race or religious harassment, robbery, and assault.  Tyrone Kenney, a 70-year-old black man who grew up during the Civil Rights Era, decried the incident.  “It speaks to the state of the times,” Kenney said. “People are desperate, they’re looking for leadership, they’re looking for guidance, but they’re not getting it at home, they’re not getting it from government.

Pruitt says he will replace the panels that advise him on science and public health issues with new members holding more diverse views. He announced the changes on Oct. 31, saying many previously appointed to the boards were potentially biased because they had received federal grants. The panels advise EPA on a wide range of issues, including drinking water standards and clean air regulations. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — The head of the Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday he intends to replace the outside experts that advise him on science and public health issues with new board members holding more diverse views.  In announcing the changes, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt suggested many previously appointed to the panels were potentially biased because they had received federal research grants. The 22 boards advise EPA on a wide range of issues, including drinking water standards and pesticide safety.  “Whatever science comes out of EPA shouldn’t be political science,” said Pruitt, a Republican lawyer who previously served as the attorney general of Oklahoma. “From this day forward, EPA advisory committee members will be financially independent from the agency.”  Pruitt has expressed skepticism about the consensus of climate scientists that man-made carbon emissions are the primary cause of global warming. He also overruled experts that had recommended pulling a top-selling pesticide from the market after peer-reviewed studies showed it damaged children’s brains.  Pruitt said he will name new leadership and members to three key EPA advisory boards soon — the Science Advisory Board, Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, and the Board of Scientific Counselors.  It was not clear from the EPA’s media release if all current board members serving out their appointed terms were immediately dismissed. EPA’s press office did not respond to messages seeking clarification on Tuesday.  As part of his directive, Pruitt said he will bar appointees who currently are in receipt of EPA grants or who are in a position to benefit such grants. He exempted people who work at state, local or tribal agencies, saying he wants to introduce more “geographic diversity” to the panels.  The five-page policy Pruitt issued Tuesday makes no mention of other potential conflicts of interest, such as accepting research funding from corporate interests regulated by EPA.  Tuesday’s announcement comes after Pruitt in May said he would not reappoint nine of the 18 members of the Board of Scientific Counselors to serve a second three-year term, as had been customary.  Current board chairwoman Deborah Swackhamer said the members were already required to follow rules intended to prevent conflicts of interests.  “It obviously stacks the deck against scientists who do not represent corporate special interests,” said Swackhamer, a retired professor who taught environmental health sciences at the University of Minnesota. “It speaks volumes that people funded by special interests are OK to be advisers, but not those who have received federal grants.”  Senate Environment Committee Chairman John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican who shares Pruitt’s skepticism of mainstream climate science, cheered the move. He said EPA’s science boards would now better reflect the views of rural states like his own.  But environmentalists worried that Pruitt will now select board members with financial ties to the fossil fuel and chemical industries.  “The Trump EPA’s continued attack on science will likely be one of the most lasting and damaging legacies of this administration,” said Sen. Tom Udall of New Mexico, the ranking Democrat on the appropriations subcommittee that approves EPA’s funding. “Pruitt is purging expert scientists from his science boards — and replacing them with mouthpieces for big polluters.”  ___  Follow Associated Press environmental writer Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck",4.083333333333333,6,"[5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 0.5, 5.0]"

1544,3212,11,8,2017,2017-11-08,Vox,Maine Medicaid expansion isn't a sure deal,"This is the web version of VoxCare, a daily newsletter from Vox on the latest twists and turns in America’s health care debate. Like what you’re reading? Sign up to get VoxCare in your inbox here.  Maine became the first state to expand Medicaid with a ballot initiative late Tuesday night — but that effort has already come under serious threat.  The Medicaid expansion ballot passed by a double-digit margin, and would be expected to expand coverage to 70,000 to 89,000 low-income Maine residents.  This morning, however, Maine Gov. Paul LePage put out a statement saying he won't implement the expansion until the legislature figures out a way to pay for it. This isn't entirely unexpected: Maine will need to kick in a small sliver of the costs of the expansion. A state agency estimates that, once fully implemented, the Medicaid expansion will cost the state $54 million annually — but also bring in $525 million in federal dollars.  Maine still needs to figure out how to raise its share of the money; that wasn't included in the ballot initiative that passed Tuesday night. And as Emma Sandoe has explained, ""in Maine the governor has the ability to declare that there is not enough funding available and the initiative must go back to the legislature for approval within 45 days of the start of the session.""  LePage used his statement to denounce the Medicaid expansion, a program he has long criticized:  Credit agencies are predicting that this fiscally irresponsible Medicaid expansion will be ruinous to Maine’s budget. Therefore, my administration will not implement Medicaid expansion until it has been fully funded by the Legislature at the levels DHHS has calculated, and I will not support increasing taxes on Maine families, raiding the rainy day fund or reducing services to our elderly or disabled.  Now, it is true that the Maine legislature has generally supported Medicaid expansion. It has passed five separate bills to enact the program. (LePage vetoed all of them.) So it's possible the legislature will work quickly to figure out a financing plan to expand Medicaid.  But the current makeup of the Senate means there may be big road blocks ahead. A helpful reader points out that the current president of the Maine Senate is a Republican named Michael Thibodeau. Last June, he announced his run for governor to replace LePage in 2018.  Thibodeau has often been critical of previous Medicaid expansion efforts in Maine. He voted against the Medicaid expansion in 2013 and again in 2014. Here's what he told the Portland Press-Herald in 2014, when he was running for office:  In the past two years, the Legislature has looked at nearly a half dozen proposals to expand this ""free"" health care yet again to mostly able-bodied Mainers who are capable of working. We simply cannot afford it. Moreover, the over-enrollment of this program has come at the cost of elderly Mainers and those with disabilities who remain on waiting lists for vital services.  It is possible there are enough moderate Republicans in the Maine legislature to overcome Thibodeau's opposition to Medicaid expansion — but right now, it isn't a sure thing. He does not appear to be a legislator who will make sure that funding comes through from the Maine legislature. If anything, his participation in the governor's primary may pull him a bit to the right on the issue.  vox-mark VoxCare Vox's email explaining the biggest news in health care, edited by Sarah Kliff Subscribe By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy. For more newsletters, check out our newsletters page  Utah will start collecting signatures for a Medicaid ballot later this month...  With the success of the Maine ballot initiative on Medicaid, I decided to check in with another state eying a similar effort: Utah.  A group of health advocacy groups, working under the umbrella of Utah Decides Healthcare, are working toward putting the expansion on their ballot next year.  ""Poll after poll has shown support in Utah for covering this population,"" says RyLee Curtis, a spokesperson for the group. ""So we're very excited and confident we can become the 34th state to expand Medicaid.""  The Utah groups will begin gathering signatures for their ballot on November 18. They'll need to collect 113,000 signatures — the equivalent of 10 percent of the votes cast in each state Senate district during the 2016 election. They have until April to get it done.  Curtis pointed out one key difference between the Maine ballot initiative and the one they're pushing in Utah: The Utah plan has a way to pay for expansion.  It proposes a small sales tax increase, which she says would work out to an additional 3 cents of tax on a $20 purchase of items, excluding food.  Including the tax hike in the ballot initiative does create some risk. It could turn voters off from supporting the initiative. Then again, it can also prevent the situation unfolding in Maine now — where a ballot passes and there isn't a clear way for the state to pay its share of the costs.  ""We wanted this to be as solid as possible,"" Curtis says. ""Our ballot is a full piece of legislation, where the Maine ballot was just about 50 words.""  ...and Idaho also has a Medicaid ballot in the works  I also caught up with Luke Mayville, who is running the Reclaim Idaho effort, which is working to get a Medicaid expansion on the ballot in 2018, too.  The group needs to gather about 55,000 signatures spread out across the state — about 6 percent of voters in 18 different districts.  ""We decided a month ago to go for it and file the ballot,"" Mayville says. ""Now we're waiting for certification from the state attorney general, and we should have the petitions ready in early December.""  Mayville argues that the successful passage in Maine creates more momentum behind their effort.  ""Ever since we declared our intention to put this on the ballot, we've heard a lot of doubt from some influential people here in Idaho,"" he says. ""Maine, we think, enables us to answer those doubts. It's a rural, conservative-leaning state. And even though Idaho leans more conservative then Maine, we consider it highly significant that it won in Maine by almost 20 points. We have quite a bit of space there.""

1540,3208,11,8,2017,2017-11-08,Vox,CBO: 13 million more uninsured if you repeal Obamacare’s individual mandate,"Repealing Obamacare’s individual mandate would lead to 13 million fewer Americans having health insurance and save the federal government $338 billion in the next 10 years.  The numbers come from a new report from the Congressional Budget Office, which re-scored the repeal as Republicans consider including it in their tax reform proposal as a means of saving money — and striking a blow to the health care law they’ve campaigned against but haven’t quite been able to undo. (President Trump is also reportedly considering an executive order that would defang the mandate.)  Four million more Americans would be uninsured in 2019, the first of the mandate’s repeal, with the uninsured figure increasing over the next decade to 13 million in 2027.  The mandate requires every American to have health insurance or pay a penalty. It’s the Affordable Care Act’s incentive for young and healthy people to buy insurance. Without it, healthier people would be expected to drop out of the market, which then increases insurance premiums. The CBO estimated premiums on the marketplaces would go up 10 percent if the mandate were repealed.  So the net effect of repealing the mandate is: fewer people insured, higher insurance premiums — but savings for the federal government.  The budget office had previously estimated that repealing the mandate would lead to 15 million fewer people having insurance and $416 billion in federal savings. These new numbers, which were updated to use a summer 2017 baseline for evaluating its repeal, represent a relatively modest change.  But they could mean a lot for the Republican tax reform dreams.  The new CBO numbers are a big deal for the GOP’s tax bill  The CBO’s revised estimate will have a dual effect on the Republican tax plan, if Congress decides to add the mandate’s repeal to their legislation.  First, repealing the mandate does save money because fewer people are projected to be enrolled in Medicaid and Obamacare’s insurance marketplaces. Those savings — $338 billion, under the new estimate — would be very useful to Republicans if they decided to add the mandate’s repeal to their tax plan.  Under the Senate’s “budget reconciliation” rules, the tax legislation can increase the federal deficit by $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years — and not a dollar more. The House tax bill currently hits that target exactly. It would be hard to make any further changes to the bill that reduce revenue or increase spending.  But by putting the mandate repeal in the tax bill, suddenly Congress would have another $340 billion to play with while tweaking their plan. They could cut rates for businesses and individuals even more, increase some tax deductions and tax credits, or otherwise spend more money in their bill in a way they can’t right now.  It’s a less little wiggle room than they had under the CBO previous estimate — $338 billion versus $416 billion — but the mandate would still provide hundreds of billions of dollars for the tax overhaul at a time when Republicans are struggling to find money.  However, Republicans would then open up their tax overhaul to accusations that it cuts health care coverage in order to cut taxes for the wealthy and corporations. Those attacks helped sink the GOP’s various Obamacare repeal plans in the Senate, where 50 of the 52 Republican senators must back the tax legislation under budget reconciliation.  The CBO has now provided a fresh attack line: A $1.5 trillion corporate tax cut is paid for by 13 million Americans losing health coverage.  Senate Republicans are already divided on this issue. Some, like Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Ted Cruz of Texas, want to do what Trump asks and repeal the mandate in the tax bill. But Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), who has already voted down three Obamacare repeal bills, told reporters this week that mixing health care with taxes “may be unnecessarily complicating things.”  The CBO’s mandate estimates have been controversial  The mandate — and the CBO’s estimates of its effects — has been a flashpoint over the past year. Republicans have accused the budget office of overstating exactly how much the mandate actually affects the insurance market.  “The CBO way overstates the power of Obamacare’s individual mandate to drive people to buy health insurance,” Avik Roy, one of the major proponents of the repeal bills that Congress considered earlier this year, told me back in May.  Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), as he sought to build support for his Obamacare repeal plan with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) this fall, devoted the opening minutes of a briefing with reporters in September to dispelling the agency’s projections about the mandate.  Other conservatives have also urged the CBO to make its methodology about the mandate’s effects publicly available.  It’s a wonky, sometimes inscrutable debate, but an important one. The projected coverage losses for the various Obamacare repeal plans — upward of 20 million — are a big reason why those bills failed in the Senate. If Republicans decide to repeal the mandate in their tax bill, you’re assured of seeing the “XX million lose coverage” attack from Democrats now that the CBO has updated its estimates.  A more significant update could be coming. The CBO did meet in September to discuss revising its methods for estimating the mandate’s impact, I’m told. The agency said in its release Wednesday that it was in the process of reevaluating its model.  But these new numbers do not reflect any new methodology. They simply update the baseline for projecting the mandate’s effects.  So for now, these new CBO numbers are most important for the Republican tax overhaul — and could determine whether they try to add Obamacare repeal to the equation.",4.25,2,"[4.5, 4.0]"

Your life is up to you. You’re not trapped in anything but your own despair. You hold the key. Stop telling yourself you don’t have the power to open the door. Everything about the language you use in describing your circumstances tells me you’re not aware of that. You write: “I want my life to change” rather than “I’m going to change my life.” The former is a passive expression of a desire; the later is an active decision. You can’t do the things you hope to do until you believe you have the capacity to do them. So that’s where to begin: by having a word with the inner voices of doom in your head and telling them to hush up. I understand why you might have those voices in your head (as someone who grew up poor in a small town and worked as a waitress, I really do), but the story you’ve told yourself about being “stuck forever” isn’t true and it doesn’t serve you. It’s time to tell yourself a different story instead.  Steve Almond: One way to begin telling that new story is to focus on the sort of life you want to lead. What emerges from your letter is mostly a desire to get out of town. But an exit plan isn’t the same thing as a destination. I love that you spend a lot of time picturing your life across the country. It tells me you’re ambitious and imaginative. What I want to know is what you envision yourself doing over there. How exactly do you want to spend your precious time on this earth? This may seem like a grandiose question, given how hard you’re working just to pay the bills on time. But it’s really not. Your new life begins the moment you start focusing on what you want, not just what you want to escape.  CS: So let’s get practical. Make a list of the things you want to do. The three you’ve cited in your letter are: move to a different part of the country, work a different job, and get an education, so let’s start there. Beneath each item on your list, make another list composed of the steps you need to take to achieve that thing. To get a new job you have to apply for one, for example. Be as specific as you can be with each item on your list and then start doing them, one by one. Some steps may require money, but others won’t. Perhaps one item beneath “get an education” is to study for college entrance exams. To do that, you can check out books from your local library. Another might be “research schools and financial aid.” That can be done online. You don’t have to do everything at once. You need only do one thing at a time. But the point is you have to do them, Broke. Each thing you do will bring you closer to the things you seek.  SA: Taking one step at a time is vital, because our popular culture is lousy with fairy tales of overnight transformation: paupers who ascend to the penthouse in the space of one Hollywood montage. This is our designated mythos, as Americans: that all you need to claim your destiny is a little pluck and luck. But more than anything, what you need is patience and humility and self-forgiveness. If you don’t have these attributes, you’re going to get discouraged. And then you’re going to get stuck. Because real change is rarely quick, and even more rarely glamorous. It resides in the small steps Cheryl speaks of, in the daily work of converting anguish into action. Fate did not deal you a hand of privilege.

Social media giant Facebook is expected to provide Congress on Monday, Oct. 2, 2017, with more than 3,000 ads that ran around the time of the 2016 presidential election and are linked to a Russian ad agency. (AP Photo/Ben Margot, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Social media giant Facebook is expected to provide Congress on Monday with more than 3,000 ads that ran around the time of the 2016 presidential election and are linked to a Russian ad agency.  Company officials will meet with the House and Senate intelligence committees and the Senate Judiciary Committee to hand over the ads, a Facebook official said. The official requested anonymity because the meetings are private.  Facebook said last month that that it had found thousands of ads linked to Facebook accounts that likely operated out of Russia and pushed divisive social and political issues during the U.S. presidential election. The company said it found 450 accounts and about $100,000 was spent on the ads.  Twitter has said it found postings linked to those same accounts, and the House and Senate intelligence panels have asked both companies, along with Google, to testify publicly in the coming weeks.  None of the companies have said whether they will accept the invitations.  The three committees are investigating Russian meddling in the election and whether there are any links to President Donald Trump’s campaign. They have recently focused on the spread of false news stories and propaganda on social media, putting pressure on the companies to turn over more information and release any Russia-linked ads.  It is unclear whether the ads will eventually be released publicly. Several lawmakers — including Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence panel — have said they believe the American public should see them.  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Sept. 21 that the company would provide the ads to Congress and also make changes to ensure the political ads on its platform are more transparent. The company is also working with Special Counsel Bob Mueller’s investigation into the Russian meddling at the Justice Department.  “As a general rule, we are limited in what we can discuss publicly about law enforcement investigations, so we may not always be able to share our findings publicly,” Zuckerberg said. “But we support Congress in deciding how to best use this information to inform the public, and we expect the government to publish its findings when their investigation is complete.”  Facebook said the ads addressed social and political issues and ran in the United States between 2015 and 2017. The company said the ads appear to have come from accounts associated with a Russian entity called the Internet Research Agency.  Twitter said last week that it had suspended 22 accounts corresponding to the 450 Facebook accounts that were likely operated out of Russia.  Warner criticized Twitter for not sharing more information with Congress, saying the company’s findings were merely “derivative” of Facebook’s work. The company’s presentations to staff last week “showed an enormous lack of understanding from the Twitter team of how serious this issue is, the threat it poses to democratic institutions.”",3.607142857142857,14,"[4.5, 5.0, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 2.0, 4.5, 4.0, 0.5, 5.0, 4.5, 5.0, 4.0, 2.0]"

Kohl's Corp., based in Menomonee Falls, Wis., said Wednesday, Sept. 6, the Amazon shops will open next month in Chicago and Los Angeles stores.(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee)  NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon has long been blamed for the falling fortunes of department stores. Now, some of them are teaming up with the e-commerce giant.  Kohl’s said Wednesday that it will open Amazon shops in 10 of its department stores that will sell Amazon Echos, Fire tablets and other gadgets. The deal comes just a few months after the owner of Sears and Kmart said it would sell its Kenmore-branded appliances on Amazon.com for the first time.  The partnership gives Kohl’s a way to differentiate itself from rival department stores and lure in shoppers looking to buy electronics. For Amazon, it gets its devices in front of more people to touch and try them.  “It is a smart move for both companies,” analysts at Jeffries said. “They always say you should keep your enemies closer.”  Department stores have struggled as more people shop online or at discount stores. Kohl’s, Macy’s and Dillard’s all reported a drop in a key sales figure last month for their latest quarters.  But despite the growth of online shopping, most retail transactions still take place in physical stores — and Seattle-based Amazon.com Inc. doesn’t seem to want to miss out. It has opened 11 bookstores in two years and recently bought grocer Whole Foods, allowing it to sell the Amazon Echo voice-activated device next to organic grapes and corn in its more than 460 stores.  Kohl’s said it will open the 1,000-square-foot Amazon areas next month within its Chicago and Los Angeles stores. The companies did not provide financial details of the deal, but said the new sections will be staffed by Amazon employees. Shoppers will be able to hire a plumber or housekeeper through Amazon. And they can also have an Amazon employee come to their home and install a device or suggest smart home products to buy. Best Buy recently launched a similar program, which sends its employees to customer’s homes to recommend electronics.  Analysts at Citi said they hope Kohl’s can add more Amazon services in its stores, like package pickup or drop-off, which could give people a reason to go into Kohl’s stores more frequently. “Perhaps this could be that start of a broader partnership,” the Citi analysts said.

558,1950,10,13,2017,2017-10-13,Vox,Americans are willing to pay $177 a year to avoid climate change,"Despite their relatively rarity in the real world, carbon taxes are the subject of endless hype and discussion in the climate-policy world.  That hype was reinvigorated last year with the introduction of a carbon tax proposal from the Climate Leadership Council, a bipartisan group that boasts several prominent (retired) Republicans among its founding members, including James Baker and George Schultz, along with a number of fossil fuel companies.  Though it didn’t go anywhere — if you’ve checked in on Congress lately, you will understand why — the CLC proposal has taken on a kind of elevated status in Washington, DC. It is now viewed as the model of what a bipartisan carbon tax should look like, should such a thing should ever become politically viable. (Weirder things have happened.)  But hang on. The CLC pitches its proposal on the premise that it will appeal to the broadest possible swathe of the public, across partisan lines. Is that true? Does it actually line up with public preferences?  Turns out, maybe not.  Designing a carbon tax requires answering two core policy questions. First, how much money should it raise? And second, how should the money be spent?  As to the first, the CLC proposal starts at $40 a ton and rises $5 a year. As to the second, the revenue goes to dividends, i.e., it is distributed back to citizens on a per-capita basis. (It’s a dividend of roughly $2,000 a year for a family of four, to begin with.) Policies like this are called “tax-and-dividend.”  Is that what the public wants?  It’s funny you should ask. The Yale Program on Climate Change Communication recently completed a large-scale survey of the public on this subject. The results were just published in the journal Environmental Research Letters.  Researchers asked a representative sample of 1,226, American adults questions seeking to determine two things. First, how much are Americans willing to pay per year to fight climate change? And second, what would they prefer government do with the revenue?  It’s the answers to the second question I want to highlight, but let’s look at the first really quickly.  How much are Americans willing to pay a year to fight climate change? $177.  To get at the first subject, researchers took an interesting approach. They did not simply ask, “would you support a carbon tax, and if so how big?”  Rather, they phrased the first question this way: “If a tax on fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) to help reduce global warming were to cost your household $X more each year in higher energy bills, would you support or oppose it?” Respondents were randomly assigned values of X.  Based on those binary yes-no answers, the researchers used some statistical hoodoo to determine overall “willingness to pay” (WTP). The results: “We find an overall mean WTP of US$177 per year, with a confidence interval ranging from US$101 to US$587.”  If you average that out over regions — which, remember, have widely varying energy costs — it translates to about 14.4 percent more on energy bills. That’s a pretty good sized hit!  A carbon tax that big would generate about $22.3 billion a year in revenue — a little bit less than the CLC’s proposal, but in the same ballpark.  There are, of course, a million reasons to take these results with a grain of salt. First off, the idea that Americans know exactly how much they’re willing to pay, in advance, to the dollar, is a little fanciful. WTP on a survey is very different from WTP in the midst of a pitched political battle with partisans on different sides pushing sharply contrasting messages.  Secondly, public opinion does not generally determine US public policy anyway. Donors, organized interest groups, and larger political trends will determine the fate of carbon policy, not broad (and shallow) public opinion.  I’d say the most we could confidently learn from this kind of WTP survey is that Americans are not overtly horrified by the idea of paying a decent chunk of money to stop climate change. Given Americans’ generally tax-averse attitudes, that’s something!  What do Americans want to spend the revenue on? Clean energy.  Among some in climate circles — an odd coalition of conservatives, libertarians, and far lefties — there is an unshakeable faith that per-capita dividends are the skeleton key that will unlock public acceptance of carbon taxes. That’s why it is part of proposals from both the conservative-leaning CLC (see its paper on the “conservative case for carbon dividends”) and the grassroots Citizens’ Climate Lobby.  It seems like dividends ought to have political appeal. If every member of the public starts getting a yearly check, it makes sense that they’re going to want to keep getting those checks. And the bigger the carbon tax, the bigger the check, so it’s an insurance policy against backlash.  Unfortunately, the public steadfastly refuses to show any similar enthusiasm for the idea. (I reviewed some of the evidence in this post.) Americans are instinctively suspicious of dividends and generally support using the revenue for the same purpose as the tax, i.e., to transition off fossil fuels.  Sure enough, here’s what the Yale researchers found:  Per-capita dividends are down below 50 percent. Developing clean energy is at 80.  As I keep saying: clean energy is consistently popular, across political and demographic lines, like almost nothing else in political life these days. It is a political vein for smart politicians to mine, the current administration notwithstanding.  In fact, I suspect that public support for plans like CLC’s would be higher if they were presented first and foremost as bold, large-scale plans to transition to clean energy — with carbon taxes a secondary feature, a funding mechanism, not the highlight.  Economists love to price externalities. Fine, we get it. But the public does not think like economists; it does not see “taxing bads” as an inspiring policy initiative in and of itself. Trying to present a tax as a positive, proactive policy is a communications nightmare, flying directly in the face of decades of conservative anti-tax propaganda. It’s about the most difficult way you could imagine to get to climate policy.  Most people’s intuitions run the other way. If we want a certain kind of future, they reason, we should take active measures to achieve that future — spend the money, develop the tech, build the infrastructure. Not just tax the stuff we don’t like and hope for the best.  In this, most people are much wiser than economists.  But even if you don’t agree, carbon tax advocates have got to grapple seriously with the fact that the public does not share their enthusiasm for dividends, or for “revenue neutrality,” another shibboleth whose political appeal is vastly overestimated by wonks.  Those concepts might have some appeal in elite circles — which, realistically, have much more influence on policy than the public does — but they are highly unlikely to be the basis of any grand upswell of public support.  It’s just hard to build a movement around a negative. People want an inspiring, positive vision to reach for. Economics is the wrong place to look for that kind of thing.",1.7727272727272727,11,"[2.5, 2.5, 0.5, 2.5, 3.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 0.5]"
379,1720,10,7,2017,2017-10-07,Vox,How birth control became part of the evangelical agenda,"The Trump administration announced Friday that it would roll back the Affordable Care Act’s mandate that employers cover workers’ birth control. During the Obama administration, the initial wave of companies granted an exemption from the rule argued that paying into a plan that covered birth control would violate their religious beliefs. But the new normal in American health care looks to be a victory for the religious right, particularly evangelicals, the only religious group in which a majority opposed the mandate, according to a 2012 Public Religion Research Institute poll.  Hours later, the Christian advocacy group My Faith Votes, whose founding honorary chair is Housing and Urban Development Secretary Dr. Ben Carson, released a statement praising Trump’s decision, saying, “The Affordable Care Act mandate forced countless business owners to pay for abortion drugs and contraceptives, even if doing so went directly against their deeply held religious beliefs or moral convictions.”  Yet among evangelical Protestants, at least, birth control — and who has access to it — has only recently become a major political issue. Unlike Catholics, whose catechism denounces use of most forms of contraception as a sin, evangelical Protestants by and large do not. (Because of the disparate nature of evangelical Protestantism, which includes hundreds if not thousands of separate denominations, it’s difficult to speak of a “formal stance” in the way we can of Catholics.) But alongside Catholic organizations like Little Sisters of the Poor, it’s evangelical-led companies like Hobby Lobby that have been on the forefront of opposition to the ACA birth control mandate.  In this, the evangelical stance on the ACA birth control mandate reflects a wider issue: the increased convergence of Catholics and evangelical Protestants — hardly historical allies — on social issues in the past few decades, as issues like the same-sex marriage debate and abortion have united the two socially conservative groups. As David Talcott, professor of philosophy at King’s College and an expert in Christian sexual ethics, told Vox, “Catholic and conservative evangelicals have become allies of certain kinds,” each defending the interests of other, as theological and philosophical overlap between the two.  Recent research supports the idea of overlap between traditional Catholic and Protestant thought. Earlier this fall, a Pew Research Center study found that average Protestants more often than not assert traditionally Catholic teachings about, among other things, the nature of salvation or the role of church teaching, reflecting a cultural crossover — however unconscious — between the two groups.  In contrast to the Catholic stance, the current set of evangelical objections to the ACA birth control mandate have less to do with any formal doctrine about birth control per se than they do about wider cultural issues, including the abortion debate, the aftermath of the sexual revolution, and precedents for religious exemptions more generally.  Hobby Lobby and similar groups object to the use of birth control that could be considered abortifacients, not birth control itself  When Hobby Lobby filed its 2012 lawsuit objecting to the mandate on religious grounds — with the Supreme Court ultimately ruling in its favor — it didn’t do so because of a general objection to birth control. Rather, it did so because certain forms of birth control, including Plan B, also known as the ""morning after pill,” could be considered an abortifacient because it prevents implantation of an already fertilized egg. Hobby Lobby founder David Green wrote in a 2012 op-ed for USA Today: “Being Christians, we don’t pay for drugs that might cause abortions. Which means that we don’t cover emergency contraception, the morning-after pill or the week-after pill. We believe doing so might end a life after the moment of conception, something that is contrary to our most important beliefs.”  The extent to which this line of reasoning applies to other forms of contraception has been a subject of debate among evangelicals, particularly in regard to the pill, which critics have argued — often in the absence of conclusive scientific evidence — may prevent the implantation of an already-fertilized egg. But these are often academic arguments — confined to scholars or pastors at conferences — rather than ones that apply to the average evangelical Christian’s lived experience.  As Talcott put it: “Most evangelicals accept [contraception]. If you go ask any evangelical or evangelical pastor, they’ll say if a married couple wants to use contraception or use the pill, then that’s fine. It hasn’t really been a moral issue within evangelicalism ... if you ask random evangelicals, whatever, they’re going to use the Pill and not think about it.""  The evangelical right’s anti-abortion stance is more recent than you’d think  Meanwhile, despite the evangelical right’s current commitment to anti-abortion policies, this was not always the case. As late as the 1960s, abortion seems to have been a debated issue among the Christian right. According to an excellent article by Rob Shryock at Salon, a 1968 document produced at a conference co-sponsored by Christianity Today and the Christian Dental and Medical Association treated the question as unresolved: “Whether the performance of an induced abortion is sinful we are not agreed, but about the necessity of it and permissibility for it under certain circumstances we are in accord. … When principles conflict, the preservation of fetal life … may have to be abandoned to maintain full and secure family life.”  But amid the culture wars of the late 1970s and the ’80s, evangelicals disillusioned by Jimmy Carter’s first term used the 1973 Supreme Court decision for Roe v. Wade as a rallying cry for conservative Christians to deny him another one. Evangelical Protestants joined their Catholic brethren — whose position against abortion and contraception had long been more established — in understanding life to begin at conception.  It’s worth noting that not all evangelicals support Trump’s wider efforts to court the religious right through similar “religious freedom” initiatives. On Friday, the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty released a statement to journalists criticizing Trump’s Department of Justice memo on religious liberty, released the same day as the birth control decision, which focused in part on religiously-motivated business’s rights: “The [new] guidance treats complicated legal issues, such as the definition of ‘substantial burden’ on religious exercise and the interplay between religious autonomy and government funding, in an overly simplistic way.” This reflects the committee’s general wariness toward the conflation of government and religion. The same group filed an amicus brief in this summer’s Trinity Lutheran v. Comer court decision, over state-level funding for a church playground, arguing against the potential for setting a precedent for “coercive government” interfering in individual religious affairs.  Some evangelical attitudes toward birth control reflect wider attitudes toward the sexual revolution  While, for most evangelicals, birth control (within a heterosexual marriage) is a non-issue, some cultural changes among evangelical Protestants have politicized contraception.  “There are a lot of people who think that the social and cultural changes of the past 50 years especially related to sex have been pretty bad,” Talcott told me, “the whole process by which we find partners, get married. I think both men and women find it unsatisfying for the most part.” While he cautioned that such evangelicals did not represent the mainstream, he noted that for some, the widespread availability of contraception contributed to their uneasiness with the sexual revolution more generally.  Talcott noted that objection to birth control among evangelicals had been more prevalent prior to the developments of the 20th century. Christians disenchanted by the outcomes of the sexual revolution, he said, might find themselves “attracted to the older view, the historic forms of marriage and Christianity and trying to see what resources are maybe there for trying to help us figure out what to do today in this sort of Wild West of Christianity. ... The marriage debate, transgender issues, are [all] forcing on the conservative wing evangelicals to think about what marriage is, and how birth control can fit into that.”  For those evangelicals, birth control — particularly the Pill — represents the worst excesses of the sexual revolution: a change in mentality from one that venerated reproduction and family life to one that focused on the individual’s (and, particularly, the individual woman’s) right to transcend their personal biology in pursuit of personal or sexual fulfillment. As Agnieszka Tennant, writing about her disillusionment with the Pill in Christianity Today, puts it: ""Could Mircette have changed not just the hormonal makeup of my cells, but also what cannot be seen under a microscope? Could it have served as one more safety lock on the door not just to my womb, but also to my figure, my marriage, my home, my career, my gym routine?”  Likewise, evangelical couples like Sam and Bethany Torode published books like 2002’s Open Embrace: A Protestant Couple Rethinks Contraception, which argued that taking medical steps to delay childbearing went against God’s plan for creation and contributed to an ethos of selfishness (the two ultimately divorced after nine years and four children, retracting their position on contraception and leaving the evangelical church).  A 2015 article in Al Jazeera profiled a number of evangelical Christians who took this stance, including Andrew Walker, director of policy studies at the Southern Baptist Convention’s Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, who said, “The idea of talking about children as a ‘scare’ and viewing them as an obstacle to the American dream, that’s not a Christian way of looking at family. ... That’s what I like to tell young couples: The family is actually a pretty adaptable institution. It doesn’t necessarily have to put a brake on your life.”  For some evangelicals, furthermore, birth control is synonymous not just with the sexual revolution but with feminism more generally. In 2001’s Lies Women Believe, a popular evangelical book by Christian radio host Nancy Leigh DeMoss, treats contraception as indicative of a much more insidious feminist mindset, coding it as a diabolical celebration of female selfishness that leads ""to the legitimization and promotion of such practices as contraception, sterilization, and family planning. As a result, unwittingly, millions of Christian women and couples have helped further Satan’s attempts to limit human reproduction and thereby destroy life.”  This perspective reached its apex with fringe movements like “Quiverfull,” whose best-known representatives, the Duggars, rose to reality TV fame. This movement mandated that good Christian families devote themselves entirely to raising as many children as possible in the faith.  Evangelical suspicion of Obama more generally intensified this trend, as the debate over the ACA combined two different hot-button questions: Is birth control acceptable and what should the government pay for? A distrust of government intervention — particularly that of the government of a “liberal” president — as well as a desire to solidify the evangelical stance on religious exceptions more generally, made the ACA birth control mandate an ideal political weathervane.  As Ron Henzel, an evangelical pastor at Midwest Christian Outreach, told me, “If there are any [evangelical] moral objections to subsidizing contraception, they're generally not based on the notion that birth control ... is evil, but rather on the more ideological question of what the government should or should not be paying for. Is birth control a legitimate form of health care, and is it the role of government to pay for it? ... Here is where evangelicals who do not have a problem with contraception are now broadly sympathetic with Roman Catholics who oppose it. ... We don't want to see anyone being forced by the government to compromise their religious views, even when we disagree with their religious views.”  But that will make little difference to the women working for these employers if — or when — they are denied the coverage they need.

Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told “Fox News Sunday.”  “He’s really setting the entire health care system on fire because the president is upset that the United States Congress won’t pass a repeal bill that is supported by 17 percent of the American public,” Murphy, a member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, added.  The money goes to companies for lowering out-of-pocket costs like co-payments and deductibles for low- and middle-income customers. It will cost about $7 billion this year and help more than 6 million people.  Ending the payments would affect insurers because ObamaCare requires them to reduce their poorer customers’ costs. Carriers are likely to recoup the lost money by increasing 2018 premiums for people buying their own health insurance policies.  The National Association of Insurance Commissioners estimates that Trump’s move would produce a 12 percent to 15 percent upsurge in premiums, while the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has put the figure at 20 percent. That’s on top of premium increases from growing medical costs.  Trump relished his latest blow against ObamaCare -- which he'd pledged to repeal during his presidential campaign, only to see the effort crash in the GOP-run Senate this summer. He’s long derided the subsidies as bailouts to insurers, even though the payments and the cost reductions for consumers are required by law.  A federal judge has found that Congress never properly approved the payments, Fox News previously reported.  The White House said in a statement that the Department of Health and Human Services has determined there is no appropriation for so-called cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers under the ObamaCare law.  “We will discontinue these payments immediately,” acting HHS Secretary Eric Hargan and Medicare administrator Seema Verma said late Thursday.  “Without the subsidies there will be many people who won’t be able to provide insurance and afford it, and the other set of subsidies that go to individuals will actually increase, meaning the deficit goes up, the amount of money we spend overall on the Affordable Care Act goes up because all that happens is the payments that used to be going to insurance companies now get substitute with increased tax credits for individuals to afford the coverage,” Murphy said.  “The fact of the matter is the president is trying to sabotage the American health care system, trying to put a gun to the head of our constituents by taking away their health care or raising their costs in order to force us to repeal a bill the American public doesn’t want us to repeal,” Murphy said about ObamaCare.

940,2442,10,23,2017,2017-10-23,Breitbart,"Bannon Speech Surprises, Delights Typically Moderate California Republican Party","Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon’s address at the California Republican Party convention on Friday in Anaheim was remarkable — not just for its content, but for the reaction it elicited from the audience.  “Steve Bannon’s speech was the one that really fired up this convention,” said State Senator Joel Anderson (R-Alpine). “It’s easy as a California Republican to lose heart when you consider the kind of policy-making coming out of Sacramento. Bannon was able to remind people that, nationally, we are making great strides and gave everyone here a reason to work harder than ever.”  California Republicans are often seen nowadays as a moderate bunch. But the party faithful warmed quickly to Bannon’s message of challenging the Washington establishment.  In fact, Bannon’s address caused more buzz at the convention than did speeches from more traditional conservative figures — House Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield), Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist, and Fox News show host Judge Janine Pirro.  Stepping out from behind the podium, comfortably walking about the stage, Bannon gave a forty-minute-long extemporaneous speech covering a myriad of issues that began with effusive praise of President Donald Trump. He continued by emphasizing the importance of winning and how victories beget victories, and about the great challenge ahead in taking on the “corporatists, lobbyists, consultants, and the politicians they control.”  Bannon’s speech was equal parts praise for President Trump and his policies; a call to action against the GOP establishment; a strong critique of former President George W. Bush and U.S. Senator John McCain (R-AZ)’s recent speeches against Trump; and words of strong encouragement for the activists in the audience.  Sen. Cotton,, a favorite of conservatives, hammered the Democrats who run California’s government for making California a “sanctuary state” for those here in violation of federal immigration laws. He also focused on the massive gas tax recently passed by Democrats in Sacramento. “If you live in West L.A. or San Francisco and you have the money to afford a Tesla, maybe you’ll be OK,” Cotton told delegates. “What about the farmer in the Central Valley who has a pickup truck and needs to fill it up three times a week?”  Rep. McCarthy also praised President Trump — and also, like Cotton, blasted Democrats in Sacramento for their left-wing, progressive agenda. McCarthy also admonished those Republicans in the state legislature who have recently been voting with Democrats, warning that they will not win a majority by being Democrat-light.  While there was a lot of enthusiasm among the delegates present, the road ahead for California Republicans looks rocky. Delegates did pass a change in party rules that allows the party to endorse primary candidates at their next convention, ostensibly to ensure at least one candidate survives the “jungle” primary. However, the next scheduled convention is in early May, long after candidate filing is closed and ballots are printed. In 2016 two Democrats — then-Attorney General Kamala Harris and then-U.S. Rep. Loretta Sanchez — made the runoff for U.S. Senate, with no Republican on the general election ballot. There is a legitimate concern that this will happen again with the governor’s race and U.S. Senate race in 2018.  Moreover, Democrats nationally are targeting about a half-dozen GOP-held House seats in California that voted for Hillary Clinton in the presidential election.  In a somewhat controversial move, convention delegates approved a change in the party’s rules allowing for the party to set up a special account from which to pay the chairman an unspecified salary. Nothing was in that change to the rules that would require any disclosure about what persons or companies are making contributions into that special fund. Up until this point the chairmanship has always been a volunteer-held position.  Jon Fleischman is the Politics Editor for Breitbart California.

Reading from her 512-page post mortem where she explains how she lost the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Marr quoted an excerpt where Clinton observed that voters “just didn’t like me” – but rather than reflectively acknowledging the loss was her responsibility, almost immediately she blamed “a concerted and effective campaign to tear me down”.  Descending into the Democrat’s favoured and familiar conspiracy theories, she claimed campaign staffer John Podesta’s emails were hacked by Russian intelligence, exposed by WikiLeaks, which she called a “mouthpiece for Russian authoritarianism”, and were “weaponised” and turned into “phony news stories” at fake news factories in Macedonia (a small, former Yugoslav nation of a population of less than one-quarter of London’s).  Claiming that “the Russians wanted to help Trump and hurt me”, she alleged Russian President Vladimir Putin had a “personal grudge” against her.  .@HillaryClinton says Brexit was a “precursor to what happened in the US” #marr pic.twitter.com/G9wSNM7EJp — The Andrew Marr Show (@MarrShow) October 15, 2017  Asked by Marr on Sunday if she thought the campaign of then-candidate Donald J. Trump colluded with Russia, she said: “We don’t know the answer to that. That is part of what is being explored.”  The globalist took another swipe at former UKIP leader Farage, accusing him of using the same “big lies” to get the president elected as those used to win the EU referendum. “I want to make another point about Brexit. Looking at Brexit, it was a precursor to what happened to us in the United States,” she said.  “You had Farage campaigning for Trump. The big lie is a very potent tool.”  Blasting the globalist former New York Senator, Brexit leader Nigel Farage told his LBC listeners Clinton needs to accept responsibility for her election loss.  “Hillary Clinton is in a state of denial, she’s making herself look, frankly, ridiculous,” Mr. Farage said.  “She blames the whole world. The Russians. The lies that were told in Brexit. Everything is the fault of other people, nothing is to do with her.”  You look ridiculous @HillaryClinton. The war is over for you. Move on. pic.twitter.com/kTa86ThMnw — Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) October 15, 2017  Mr. Farage, who suggested last week Clinton retitle her book “The Great Big Whinge”, added: “American voters were turned off by her sense of entitlement.  “I don’t think Hillary Clinton has much relevance. We should no more listen to Hillary Clinton than we listened to Barack Obama during the referendum campaign telling us not to vote for Brexit.”  Addressing the former U.S. Secretary of State directly, Farage said: “Hillary you lost. Move on. The war is over for you.”  Asked on the UK’s exit from the European Union and the impact of a ‘no deal’ scenario, she said it would be “a very big disadvantage to Britain,” where the UK “would not have as easy access to the European market that you’ve had under EU membership” – ignoring the fact that that European countries are also reliant on trade with the UK.  Clinton then mocked the prospective trade deal with the U.S. under President Trump, alleging “You’re making a trade deal with someone who doesn’t believe in trade,” despite the president pledging multiple times the UK would be at the front of the queue to sign a trade deal.  Describing “your friend Harvey Weinstein”, Marr asked the failed presidential candidate about her knowledge of the Hollywood mogul’s alleged predatory behaviour following multiple accusations of sexual misconduct, assault, and even rape by dozens of actresses including Cara Delevingne, Kate Beckinsale, and Ashley Judd.  Admitting the strong ties between herself, Weinstein, and the Democratic Party, she implied no knowledge of the misconduct before women came forward, stating: “I was shocked and appalled as I’ve known him through politics as many Democrats have. He’s been a funder, a supporter for all of us – for Obama, for me, for people who have run for office in the United States.”  She was quick to deflect away from her association by saying: “I think it’s important that we do not just focus on him… but that we recognise this behaviour cannot be tolerated anywhere,” not missing the opportunity to recall to viewers when the president apologised after a tape was released of Trump making lewd comments about women in 2005.  “After all, we have someone admitting to being a sexual assaulter in the Oval Office,” Clinton said, forgetting her own husband and former President Bill Clinton was accused of the alleged brutal rape of Juanita Broaddrick, sexual assault of Kathleen Willey, and sexual harassment of Paula Jones.  Marr picked up on this omission, noting that the Democrat has urged female victims of abuse to come forward, but “yet in your book three women brought onto the stage by Trump attacking your husband you dismissed them. Are you sure that is the right thing to do? Are you sure about that?”  “Well, yes because that had all been litigated,” Clinton defended, saying that “there were conclusions drawn and that was clearly in the past”.  Speaking to Breitbart News, Broaddrick said: “Harvey Weinstein and Bill Clinton are cut from the same cloth… They are both powerful men and had the ability to protect themselves from the rumours and whispers about their well known, deviant, and criminal behaviour.”  Twitter Follow @friedmanpress Follow Victoria Friedman on",1.3461538461538463,13,"[0.5, 3.5, 1.0, 1.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 0.5, 0.5, 4.0, 0.5]"
995,2543,10,25,2017,2017-10-25,Associated Press News,Analysis: Can the GOP survive the Trump presidency?," Can the traditional Republican Party survive the presidency of Donald Trump?  That existential question, which has nagged at Republicans since Trump’s stunning election one year ago, flared up anew Tuesday with Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake’s announcement that he is retiring from Congress. One of the GOP’s most consistent critics of the president, Flake was facing a tough primary challenge in next year’s election from at least one candidate with the backing of some Trump allies.  “There may not be a place for a Republican like me in the current Republican climate or the current Republican Party,” said Flake, a conservative who has worked with Democrats on issues like immigration and the Obama administration’s detente with Cuba.  The senator’s dour assessment of his future in the Republican Party gave voice to worries that have gripped the GOP heading into the midterm elections. Trump has shown little loyalty to some sitting senators, and has openly squabbled with Flake and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Some of the president’s ardent supporters — led by former White House senior adviser Steve Bannon — are actively courting GOP primary challengers who are more willing to buck the Republican establishment in Washington than line up behind its leaders.  President Donald Trump arrived at the U.S. Capitol to speak with members of the Republican caucus amid a bitter dispute with fellow Republican Sen. Bob Corker, who has been speaking out against the president's leadership skills. (Oct. 24)  Andy Surabian, a senior adviser for the pro-Trump group Great America Alliance, said Flake’s retirement is part of a trend and “should serve as another warning shot to the failed Republican establishment that backed Flake and others like them that their time is up.”  To be sure, intra-party divisions are hardly new for the GOP, which has struggled for years to reconcile its more moderate, pro-business wing with the growing crop of populists and nationalists that ultimately fueled Trump’s political rise. Trump’s election may have left Republicans with control of both the White House and Congress but it did nothing to heal the divisions. If anything, Trump — a former Democrat with no ideological mooring to conservative principles or deep ties to GOP leaders — has exacerbated the gulf between millions of GOP voters and the congressional leaders sent to Washington to represent them.  Peter Wehner, a Trump critic who served in President George W. Bush’s White House, said there’s a “struggle going on for the soul of conservatism and the Republican Party.” He urged more traditional Republicans to stay and fight for their principles instead of fleeing — though he left open the prospect that it’s a fight they ultimately may not win.  “If this party is defined by Donald Trump and Steve Bannon, then a lot of these people aren’t going to want to be a part of that party anyway,” Wehner said.  The anti-establishment forces already had one victory under their belt after firebrand jurist Roy Moore defeated incumbent Sen. Luther Strange in the Alabama GOP primary last month. Moore is considered an outlier among Republicans and hardly a guaranteed vote for McConnell if he lands in the Senate next year.  Flake’s comments Tuesday from the Senate floor came hours after Sen. Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican who has also decided not to seek re-election, declared Trump was “debasing” the United States with untruths and name-calling. Last week, Sen. John McCain lamented a climate of “half-baked, spurious nationalism” and Bush bemoaned “bullying and prejudice in our public life” — comments that appeared to be veiled criticism of Trump, though neither man mentioned the president by name.  Privately, many more Republican officials have raised deep concerns about the direction Trump is pulling the party, both on policy and tone. He’s pulled the GOP to the right on immigration only to raise the prospect of making a deal with Democrats to allow young people brought to the U.S. illegally as children to stay in the country. He’s withdrawn the U.S. from a major Pacific Rim trade pact and threatened to pull out of a long-standing deal with Canada and Mexico. The president has also drawn open support from some white nationalists, a reality that was magnified after he equivocated in his response to clashes between white supremacists and counter-protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, this summer.  But aside from occasional criticism of Trump’s tweets or most callous comments, most Republican office holders have stayed silent, in part out of fear of alienating the president’s supporters. A handful of House Republicans have taken the same path as Flake and Corker, announcing plans to retire rather than run for re-election in competitive districts.  Trent Lott, the former Republican Senate majority leader from Mississippi, blamed much of the GOP discontent on the fact that even with a Republican in the White House, the party has been unable to make good on its promises to voters. Efforts to repeal “Obamacare” have failed in embarrassing fashion. Many see the current debate over a tax overhaul package as their last best chance for a legislative breakthrough before the midterms and predict sweeping losses for the GOP if a bill doesn’t pass.  But Lott, too, said the solution for conservatives is to stay in Trump’s Republican Party, not walk away,  “You don’t complain that there’s not room for you in your party, you make room,” he said.  _  Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC",3.4,10,"[5.0, 2.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.0, 4.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.0, 3.5]"
171,995,4,8,2017,2017-04-08,Vox,Uber just fired the engineer at the center of its legal fight with Google,"Uber has fired the star engineer who has been at the center of its legal battle with Waymo, Google’s self-driving car unit. The engineer, Anthony Levandowski, is a former Waymo engineer who left to start a self-driving truck company that was quickly acquired by Uber.  Waymo sued Uber, charging that Levandowski stole confidential information on the way out the door and used the information in his new job at Uber. But when Waymo tried to force Levandowski to turn over the documents, Levandowski invoked the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination instead.  That put Uber in an awkward position, since it had an obligation to turn over relevant documents but couldn’t do so without Levandowski’s cooperation. The judge in the case encouraged Uber to threaten termination in order to compel Levandowski to turn over the documents, and now Uber has followed through on the threat.  Levandowski’s firing removes a potential headache for Uber, but the company still has some serious problems. On the one hand, Uber needs to convince the courts that it did not, in fact, base its design for a key sensor on Waymo’s own designs. At the same time, Uber needs to continue making progress on its own self-driving technology — something that will become more difficult now that it has been forced to fire one of the most accomplished engineers in the self-driving car business.  And Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has said his company will be in big trouble if another company beats it to market with self-driving technology.  “If we are not tied for first, then the entity that's in first then rolls out a ride-sharing network that is far cheaper or far higher-quality than Uber's, then Uber is no longer a thing,” Kalanick said in a 2016 interview.  Uber hoped that hiring some of Waymo’s top engineers would help it catch up to Waymo. But now Uber has been forced to fire one of the key engineers from that deal, and it’s going to be distracted by continued litigation with Waymo for months — if not years — to come.  Levandowski is at the center of Waymo’s fight with Uber  Anthony Levandowski is a brilliant engineer and the driving force behind the business deal that ultimately led to Waymo’s lawsuit. Levandowski quit his job at Google (now Waymo) in early 2016 and immediately started a new company called Otto. Just a few months later, in May 2016, the company unveiled a prototype of its self-driving truck technology. In August, Otto was acquired by Uber for around $700 million — a massive payout for a company that had existed for less than a year.  Waymo now claims that the reason Levandowski was able to get the new self-driving truck technology working so quickly is that key elements of the design were stolen from Waymo. According to Waymo, Levandowski downloaded 14,000 confidential documents from the Waymo network in the days before he left his old employer. And Waymo believes he illegally relied on those documents to guide the development of Otto’s own technology.  Levandowski isn’t well-known to the public, but in the industry it has long been obvious that he was a rising star. A 2003 profile of him as a 23-year-old UC Berkeley graduate student reported that he was already working to raise $600,000 for a startup.  In 2004, the military’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which brought you the internet, announced a competition to build a self-driving car that could make it across the desert. Levandowski organized a team to enter the competition, but for an extra challenge the team built a self-driving motorcycle instead of a car. They didn’t win — in fact, no one’s vehicle completed the course that year — but it was the start of Levandowski’s involvement in the self-driving vehicle industry.  Levandowski went on to found a startup called 510 Systems with some Berkeley colleagues. It started out selling camera technology to Google for collecting Street View images. Levandowski joined Google to work on its mapping technology in 2007, but continued working closely with his 510 Systems colleagues on Google-related projects. Finally, in 2011 Google acquired 510 Systems, and its engineers became early members of Google’s self-driving car project.  This early history may explain Levandowski’s casual attitude about working on side projects at the same time he was on Google’s payroll. Waymo now claims that in 2012, unbeknownst to Google, Levandowski took a stake in another startup called Odin Wave (for reasons that aren’t clear, it’s also went by “Tyto Lidar” in some documents) that was founded by one of his teammates from the DARPA Grand Challenge days. “Lidar” refers to a key sensor technology that allows a self-driving car to form a 3D picture of its surroundings.  Waymo says that in 2013, it heard from a third-party vendor that Odin Wave had submitted an order to build a custom lidar sensor that was suspiciously similar to Google’s own design. When confronted in 2013, Waymo says, Levandowski denied having an ownership interest in the company.  The next year, Google considered buying Odin Wave and asked Levandowski to evaluate the possibility. Waymo now says that Levandowski never disclosed a relationship to the company even as he was advising Google about whether to buy it.  In summer 2015, Waymo alleges in a court filing, Levandowski started talking to Uber — months before he officially left Waymo to found Otto. Pierre-Yves Droz, a 510 Systems co-founder who is now a senior Waymo engineer, stated in the filing that Levandowski spent months trying to recruit engineers on his Waymo team to join his startup, and that he expected from the outset to sell the company to Uber.  Droz wrote that over dinner in the summer of 2015, Levandowski “told me that it would be nice to create a new self-driving car startup and that Uber would be interested in buying the team responsible for the LiDAR we were developing at Google.”  Of course, there’s nothing illegal about an experienced engineer leaving one company to work at another one. And especially in California, where the courts don’t enforce noncompete agreements, there’s nothing illegal about an engineer putting the skills and knowledge he’d developed at one job to use for a new employer.  But Google’s new Waymo division believes Levandowski crossed the line by actively recruiting employees for his new venture while he was still on Waymo’s payroll, and by taking confidential documents with him when he left Waymo.  Uber says it’s done nothing wrong  Uber responded to Waymo’s accusations in an April court filing. “Both of Waymo’s central premises — that former Waymo employees brought thousands of confidential Waymo documents to Uber to build a copycat lidar and that Uber’s lidar closely mimics Waymo’s single-lens design — are demonstrably false,” the company wrote.  Uber said it had strict policies in place to ensure that employees don’t bring confidential information with them when they join Uber from another technology company. And it said those safeguards worked: A search of Uber’s network and the laptops of key employees did not turn up copies of the documents Waymo says were stolen by Levandowski.  However, this argument had a big, important caveat: Uber was unable to search Levandowski’s personal computers because he had gotten his own lawyer and invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.  “Uber finds itself in a complicated situation” due to Levandowski’s lack of cooperation, the ride-hailing company admitted in its April legal filing. A month later, Uber resolved that complication by firing Levandowski.  Uber also argued that its lidar technology can’t have been copied from Waymo’s because there were significant differences between them. Lidar works by bouncing a laser off nearby objects and capturing it when it bounces back. One of Waymo’s key innovations was to use the same lens for both sending and receiving these laser pulses, significantly reducing the complexity and cost of the lidar system.  Waymo accused Uber of copying this innovation, but Uber says that’s wrong. Uber says it began developing its own lidar in early 2015 and that it uses two lenses for transmitting laser pulses and two more for receiving them. Uber says that’s one of several key differences that demonstrates that its technology isn’t derived from Waymo’s.  Uber’s reply was packed full of other technical details that the company says demonstrate that its lidar was not based on Waymo’s technology. However, most of these details are redacted in the public version of the document.  The document also leaves a big unanswered question: Why did Uber pay around $700 million for Otto if it wasn’t trying to get its hands on key Waymo technologies? It’s possible, of course, that Uber was just optimistic about Otto’s self-driving truck business. Or perhaps Uber felt the Waymo veterans’ general knowledge about self-driving car technology — knowledge not protected by trade secret laws — was worth hundreds of millions of dollars.  But we can expect Waymo to press this point as the litigation continues. The company will look for “smoking gun” evidence proving that Levandowski and his colleagues illegally incorporated elements of Waymo’s technology into Uber’s own lidar sensors.

864,2336,10,19,2017,2017-10-19,Vox,A detained 17-year-old immigrant wants an abortion. The government went to court to stop her.,"At a shelter in South Texas, a teenager is fighting the federal government to get an abortion.  The 17-year-old, identified in court documents as Jane Doe, came to the US as an undocumented, unaccompanied minor. She was taken into custody at the United States-Mexico border on September 11.  Since President Donald Trump took office, policies toward undocumented young people seeking abortions have changed. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed suit on behalf of Doe, all unaccompanied minors in immigration shelters now need permission from the director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement — and he has gone to extraordinary lengths to prevent undocumented young people from getting the procedure. In Doe’s case, ORR has prevented her from leaving the Texas shelter where she now lives in order to get an abortion.  Last Wednesday, United States District Judge Tanya Chutkan ordered the government to allow Doe to leave for the procedure. The government appealed, and last Friday, a new court order bought the government some time: ORR had until October 31 to transfer Doe from the shelter into the care of a qualified sponsor who would let her get an abortion. If such a sponsor couldn’t be found, the ACLU could return to court to seek another order requiring ORR to release Doe for the procedure. The ACLU appealed the ruling and on Tuesday, an appeals court ruled in Doe’s favor. That means she should be able to schedule and obtain an abortion — unless the government appeals again.  The clock is ticking — Doe is 15 weeks pregnant, and Texas law bans abortions after 20 weeks. And Doe’s case matters not just for her, but for the thousands of unaccompanied minors who cross the border every year.  Undocumented, unaccompanied minors face new abortion restrictions under the Trump administration  This spring, President Trump appointed E. Scott Lloyd to head the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is responsible for caring for unaccompanied, undocumented minors while they wait for decisions in their immigration cases. Around the same time, according to the ACLU, the ORR instituted a new policy: Shelters were to take no action to help minors get abortions without Lloyd’s permission. That included scheduling appointments or transportation, or arranging for minors to get counseling that included information about abortion. Previously, minors only needed to seek permission from ORR if they wanted the federal government to pay for their abortions, since federal funding for the procedure is restricted by the Hyde Amendment, said Brigitte Amiri, the lead lawyer for the ACLU on Doe’s case.  Because of the new policy, the ACLU says Jane Doe’s shelter prevented her from getting to a health center for counseling, and made clear she would not be allowed to get the abortion. Texas law requires parental consent for a minor to get an abortion, but Doe was able to get permission from a judge to seek the procedure since her parents are not in the country. She was not seeking help paying for the abortion or setting up transportation for the procedure, BuzzFeed News reported.  “The US Supreme Court has said in Roe v. Wade that the government can’t ban abortion, and that’s exactly what happened here,” Amiri told Vox. “The government was blocking Jane Doe from accessing abortion by essentially holding her hostage. Any first-year law student would tell you that is unconstitutional.”  Doe is not the only minor who’s been affected by the policy, according to the ACLU. In March, according to court documents filed by the group, another minor at a shelter in Texas chose to have a medication abortion after getting a judge’s permission for the procedure. After she had taken the first dose of the medication, ORR officials forced her to go to an emergency room to see if the abortion could be reversed. Ultimately, she was allowed to proceed with the abortion and take the remaining dose of the medication. In another case, the ACLU said, Lloyd traveled from Washington, DC, to meet personally with a young woman to try to convince her not to have an abortion.  According to the ACLU, ORR requires minors seeking abortions to get counseling at crisis pregnancy centers, which are anti-abortion and sometimes give patients misinformation. Jane Doe was required to go to a crisis pregnancy center, where she was forced to have a medically unnecessary ultrasound.  In a statement to Vox, the Administration for Children and Families, of which the ORR is part, called Judge Chutkan’s order “a troubling ruling that exceeds the U.S. Constitution and sets a dangerous precedent by opening our borders to any illegal children seeking taxpayer-supported, elective abortions.”  “Though the order overrides the policies and procedures of the Office of Refugee Resettlement designed to protect children and their babies who have illegally crossed the border, we will continue to provide them with excellent health care and protect their well-being in all our facilities,” the ACF said. “We will consider our next steps to ensure our country does not become an open sanctuary for taxpayer-supported abortions by minors crossing the border illegally.”  In a motion to stay Judge Chutkan’s order pending an appeal, the government argued that allowing Jane Doe to terminate her pregnancy would violate Department of Health and Human Services policy against facilitating abortions, because it would require HHS or shelter staff to “draft and sign approval documents” and “monitor Ms. Doe’s health during and immediately after the abortion,” among other tasks. If Doe wants to get an abortion, the motion says, she can leave the United States or find a qualified sponsor to live with who will let her get one. The court order issued on Friday required Doe to pursue the second option — finding a sponsor — before she could again ask the government to release her for the abortion.  Jane Doe’s case matters for other undocumented minors, too  Undocumented immigrants in general face obstacles to reproductive health care, from fear of encountering immigration officials on the way to a clinic to a lack of health insurance. But unaccompanied minors living in shelters face unique challenges. Shelters are typically operated by private organizations that contract with the government, and even before the ORR policy change, some of these organizations blocked minors from getting birth control, emergency contraception, or abortions, according to a fact sheet issued by the National Women’s Law Center earlier this year.  This is especially problematic for “young people who have experienced real trauma, and maybe have experienced sexual assault, and are then put in a space where they can’t get access to reproductive health care,” said Kelli Garcia, the director of reproductive justice initiatives at the NWLC, in a September interview with Vox. “It’s shameful.”  The ACLU has also filed a motion for class certification, which would help all undocumented minors in Jane Doe’s situation seek abortions without intervention by ORR. For now, the fate of that motion is uncertain. So is Doe’s future — the ruling on Tuesday sends her case back to district court, which will issue a new order requiring ORR to release Doe for the abortion. However, the government still has the opportunity to appeal.  In the meantime, Doe, who has been trying to get an abortion since September, will have to wait at least a little longer.  “She is tired of the fight,” Amiri said, “but she is resilient, and she is very, very brave.”",3.1666666666666665,3,"[3.5, 5.0, 1.0]"

The European Union is looking beyond its impending breakup with Britain at how to build a common future with the 27 nations remaining in the bloc. (AP Photo/Virginia Mayo)  TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Twenty-seven European Union nations, excluding Britain, will be coming up with clear options on a more tightly knit future for themselves even before they will allow divorce negotiations with the U.K. to move toward brokering a new relationship.  EU Council President Donald Tusk said Friday he would be presenting “a political agenda in two weeks’ time,” after EU vision statements in recent weeks from French President Emmanuel Macron, EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and others on how to the reform the bloc.  That will be just days before the next EU summit, which is expected to reject for now British demands to start negotiating on the country’s future links with the bloc alongside the current talks on how to make the cleanest Brexit possible.  Officials said Tusk will be given the job of reconciling Macron’s vision of how the EU should embrace a joint budget, a shared military and harmonized taxes to stay globally relevant with those ideas of EU nations that might not want to grow too closer too quickly.  Tusk said he would seek “real solutions to real problems” and stressed the need to make progress “step-by-step, issue-by-issue.”  Macron said the EU had to seize the moment of having an improved economy and increased confidence in the bloc to push through reforms before European elections in 2019.  “2018 is a year of opportunity for Europeans,” he said. “In 5 or 10 years, it will be too late.”  Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte warned, however, not to set the bar too high, since changes in the bloc of half a billion people have always been tough to achieve.  “Under-promise and over-deliver,” Rutte said. “Don’t promise an elephant and see a mouse show up.”  The collegial atmosphere was bolstered by a non-confrontational dinner Thursday night for EU leaders, where few of the usual east-west or north-south fissures spoiled the mood, officials said.  The goodwill has not extended to the issue of Brexit over the past months.  EU leaders at their Oct. 19-20 summit have to say whether “sufficient progress” has been achieved on divorce issues with Britain — citizens’ rights, the Irish border and a financial settlement — to grant the U.K. its wish to start talking about a new trade deal with the EU.  Juncker said it will take “a miracle” for there to be sufficient progress by then, despite a round of negotiations in Brussels this week that ended with some progress.  Other EU leaders sounded a similar tone. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said despite “a better vibe and a better mood coming out of the negotiations” he questioned whether the time was right to move on to trade issues with Britain.  “It’s still very evident that there’s more work to be done,” he said.  For the past week, though, British Prime Minister Theresa May has sounded more conciliatory. In Estonia, she guaranteed her country’s commitment to security even though the nation is leaving the bloc.  May visited troops in Estonia close to the Russian border on Friday and said “the United Kingdom is unconditionally committed to maintaining Europe’s security.”  “We will continue to offer aid and assistance to EU member states that are the victims of armed aggression, terrorism and natural or man-made disasters,” she vowed.  She also proposed a “new security partnership” to weather the divorce when her country leaves the bloc in March 2019.",2.6363636363636362,11,"[0.5, 4.0, 2.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 4.5, 1.5, 2.0, 2.0, 3.5]"

Jeff Hoover denied sexually harassing the staff member, but said he sent inappropriate text messages that were consensual. Hoover’s wife and two of his three daughters were in the room as he spoke.  “I engaged in banter that was consensual but make no mistake it was wrong on my part to do that. And for that, I am truly sorry,” Hoover said. “I want to reiterate that at no time, at no time did I engage in unwelcome or unwanted conduct of any kind.”  Thomas Clay, a Louisville attorney who represents the victim, said his client had “legitimate concerns about workplace conduct.”  “Our client was not coerced by anyone to resolve the matter and has been satisfied with the resolution,” Clay said. “We look forward to moving past this matter.”  Hoover said he will remain in the legislature. House Speaker Pro Tempore David Osborne will become the acting speaker.  The resignation comes amid a brutal legislative fight to change the state’s struggling public pension system. Gov. Matt Bevin’s proposal would eventually end Kentucky’s pension system and replace it with a 401(k)-style retirement plan for state workers and public school teachers.  The bill has the votes in the Senate, but not the House. Hoover had said he would not vote for the bill without changes, and he has been critical of some of Bevin’s comments about teachers and other state workers.  “It’s fair to say I am not the favorite legislator of some in this capitol,” Hoover said without mentioning Bevin’s name.  On Saturday afternoon, House Republican leaders announced they planned to hire a private law firm to investigate the allegations and would grant them the power to subpoena witnesses. A news release Sunday said the investigation will continue.  Hoover said he received a letter on Oct. 17 from a lawyer whose client made allegations of sexual harassment against Hoover and others. He said everyone reached an agreement on Oct. 25. Hoover said no one admitted wrongdoing and everyone agreed to keep the settlement secret because the victim was going to keep her job.  But Wednesday evening, The Courier-Journal reported the settlement, based on anonymous sources, which eventually led to Hoover’s resignation.  Hoover has been speaker since January, shortly after Republicans won a majority in the state House for the first time in nearly a century. The victory gave Republicans control of every state legislative chamber in the South.  “I have asked for and received forgiveness from God, my family, my wonderful wife, Karen, and my daughters,” Hoover said. “The decision today is what is best for Kentucky.

ANALYST’S TAKE: “Market participants are waiting for the nomination of the next Fed chair to assess future monetary policy shifts,” said Margaret Yang Yan, a market analyst at CMC Markets in Singapore. “Current Fed governor Jerome Power is believed to be the most promising candidate, who will likely bring certainty and consistency to the rate hike path.”  FED WATCH: The Federal Reserve kept its interest rates steady at their low levels as widely expected and upgraded their views on the U.S. economy saying that the world’s largest economy is rising “at a solid rate,” a term stronger than “moderate” rate used in September. The phrase strengthened the views that the Fed was due to hike interest rates in December. President Donald Trump is expected to name the successor to Fed Chair Janet Yellen later in the day.

The publishing of the agreement this weekend follows former DNC interim Chairwoman Donna Brazile’s bombshell accusation Thursday that the party’s 2016 presidential primary contest between Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders was rigged by the DNC to hand the nomination to Clinton.  Brazile, also a onetime Clinton confidante and CNN commentator, made the claims in an article in Politico while touting a new book.  The agreement, in the form of a memo obtained by NBC News, shows the DNC gave the Clinton campaign input on hiring and spending decisions in exchange for money to help the cash-strapped group, including an initial $1.2 million payment.  Hillary for America “personnel will be consulted and have joint authority over strategic decisions over the staffing, budget, expenditures, and general election related communications, data, technology, analytics, and research,"" the Aug. 26, 2015, memorandum from campaign manager Robby Mook to DNC chief executive Amy Dacey states in part. “This does not include any communications related to primary debates -- which will exclusively be controlled by the DNC.”  Clinton didn’t effectively secure the party nomination until July 2016, after an unexpectedly strong challenge from Sanders, an Independent who temporarily joined the Democratic Party to run for the White House.  The memorandum also attempts to argue that nothing in the joint-fundraising agreement “shall be construed to violate the DNC’s obligation of impartiality and neutrality through the nominating process” and acknowledges the group “may enter into similar agreements with other candidates.”  President Trump and other Republicans immediately seized on the book excerpts to validate their belief that Clinton had stolen the election from Sanders. In addition, Trump has suggested the FBI and Justice Department look into the matter.  “I know Donald Trump and Republicans would like to use Hillary Clinton as a whipping boy,” Liz Smith, who was a spokeswoman for Martin O’Malley, another 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, on Saturday told Fox News’ “America’s News Headquarters.” But she’s in our past. We are moving beyond her.”  Smith also said new DNC Chairman Tom Perez has acknowledged problems with the 2016 campaign and has vowed to fix them.  Trump tweeted Friday: “The real story on Collusion is in Donna B's new book. Crooked Hillary bought the DNC & then stole the Democratic Primary from Crazy Bernie!,” “I always felt I would be running and winning against Bernie Sanders, not Crooked H, without cheating, I was right.”  Brazile fired back on Twitter.  ""Today’s lesson: Being quoted by Donald Trump means being MIS-quoted by Donald Trump. Stop trolling me,"" she tweeted with the hashtag #NeverSaidHillaryRiggedElection:  She also tweeted: ""Mr President, please -- go back to attacking me. It’s better than having my own words scrambled and spewed out by you.""

Pence visited Southern California on Monday to raise money for endangered Republican congressional candidates, hoping to foil Democrats' hopes of retaking the House next year. (Randy Pench/The Sacramento Bee via AP)  NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. (AP) — Vice President Mike Pence traveled up California on Monday to raise money for endangered Republican congressional candidates and tout the Trump administration’s proposal for cutting taxes.  It was the first visit to the heavily Democratic state by a member of the Trump-Pence ticket since the November election, when Democrat Hillary Clinton won the state by more than 4 million votes. Pence jetted from a Southern California fundraiser costing $2,700 for lunch at a luxury resort to Northern California for a hotel dinner in Sacramento alongside U.S. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy.  In between, he toured a small manufacturing company just outside of the capital to promote a tax plan he said would ease filing for 90 percent of families and lower taxes for small businesses.  He predicted an improved economy would help Republican candidates hold their ground in California and promised quick action on tax reform. The plan would, among other things, lower the corporate tax rate to 20 percent and raise the standard deduction, Pence said.  “We’re going to get this done, and we’re going to get this done this year,” he said, making no mention of President Donald Trump’s struggle to see other priorities such as health care reform pass through Congress.  Pence deviated little from the topics at hand, making no mention at the business tour of the president’s recent spat with GOP Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee or his own decision to leave an NFL game on Sunday when players kneeled during the national anthem. He did, though, pledge federal assistance as Northern California battles deadly wire fires near the Napa and Sonoma wine countries, although it was unclear if he was promising to answer Gov. Jerry Brown’s request for a federal disaster declaration.  “We’ll be working very closely with Gov. Brown and California to see you through these challenging times,” Pence said.  Pence arrived Sunday in Los Angeles for a three-day swing through the state, and he’ll head back to Southern California on Tuesday.  California has long been a source of campaign dollars for both major political parties. Pence’s money-raising efforts were aimed at boosting Republicans, who are seen as key targets in the Democrats quest to retake the U.S. House of Representatives in 2018.  Democrats are targeting seven California Republicans who hold seats in districts carried by Clinton in last year’s presidential campaign. Clinton trounced Trump in the strongly Democratic state, and Democrats are hoping opposition to the president’s environmental, immigration and health care policies in California will drive voters to the polls next year.  Several of those competitive seats are in Orange County, once a Republican fortress where Democrats have been steadily increasing their numbers.  House members who attended the Newport Beach fundraiser included Reps. Darrell Issa, Mimi Walters, Dana Rohrabacher and Ed Royce, said Republican National Committeeman Shawn Steel, who hosted the event.  Republicans “want to build a firewall” in California, undercutting Democratic chances of retaking the House in 2018, Steel said.  “The Democrats think that they have an opportunity in California. It’s a bad bet,” Steel added.  California has waged repeated battles against the Trump administration this year, particularly on immigration and the environment. State Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a former member of Congress, has sued over the administration’s numerous attempts to roll back environmental regulations and last week Brown signed legislation that limits the ability of California police to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.  __  Associated Press writer Michael R.

Max Holland, a Washington writer and author of the 2004 book “The Kennedy Assassination Tapes,” said he believed expectations about potential revelations from the files were overblown.

He cautioned against conspiratorial thinking that runs against the evidence, which he finds persuasive, that Oswald alone killed Kennedy.  “I can understand why people are curious,” Mr. Holland said. “But the level of distrust in this country is such that people will believe anything. The problem is really with us.”  Indeed, the Kennedy assassination has continued to intrigue and puzzle the American public long after most of the main players have died. While the Warren Commission concluded that Oswald acted alone, most people have never accepted the official version of events. A poll by Gallup in 2013, at the time of the 50th anniversary, found that 61 percent of Americans still believed that others besides Oswald were involved — and that was the lowest percentage of skeptics found in nearly a half century.  “We just have to realize that there is never going to be an explanation of the Kennedy assassination that will satisfy everyone,” Mr. Beschloss said. “That will never happen.

Job growth remains strong, suggesting that the work force is still expanding; wage growth is modest, suggesting employers are still able to find workers with relative ease; and inflation weakened in recent months, puzzling Fed officials and economists who had predicted that prices would begin to rise more quickly as labor market conditions tightened.  The Fed’s preferred measure of price inflation increased by just 1.4 percent during the 12 months ending in July, the most recent available data. The Fed is likely to undershoot its target of 2 percent annual inflation for the sixth consecutive year. That has caused consternation among some economists and Fed officials, who are wary of raising rates given the Fed’s inability so far to achieve its inflation objectives.  “I can’t say this year that I can easily point to a sufficient set of factors” to explain low inflation, Ms. Yellen said Wednesday. She added, however, that low inflation this year did not imply low inflation next year. “What we need to do is figure out whether the factors that have lowered inflation are going to prove persistent,” she said.  Ms. Yellen said that weak inflation readings earlier this year “reflect developments that are largely unrelated to broader economic conditions.” Similarly, she said that the Fed expected the impact of hurricanes on gas prices to increase inflation temporarily. So far, the Fed’s assessment of underlying conditions remains unchanged: Ms. Yellen and her colleagues expect inflation to stabilize at its target of 2 percent a year.  The Fed wants to use its benchmark rate to manage economic conditions while gradually draining its investment portfolio in the background. When Ms. Yellen described the Fed’s plans in June, she expressed hope that the process would be like “watching paint dry.”  The Fed holds about $4.2 trillion in Treasury securities and mortgage bonds, which it accumulated to put downward pressure on interest rates. It must regularly replenish its holdings as bonds mature. Beginning in October, it plans to withhold $10 billion a month from the reinvestment process — in effect causing that much money to disappear.  It will then increase the pace by $10 billion each quarter until reaching a monthly rate of $50 billion, and then maintain that pace until it reaches an unspecified finishing line.",4.0,5,"[3.0, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0]"

In an effort to try to crack Stephen Paddock’s state of mind, the FBI spent hours on Wednesday interviewing his longtime girlfriend, who returned Tuesday from a weekslong overseas trip and said she had no inkling of the massacre he was plotting when he sent her to see family in her native Philippines.  “He never said anything to me or took any action that I was aware of that I understood in any way to be a warning that something horrible like this was going to happen,” Marilou Danley, 62, said in a statement read by her lawyer outside FBI headquarters in Los Angeles.  Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said it’s difficult to believe Paddock acted alone in the attack Sunday that killed 58 and injured nearly 500 people at a country music concert on the Las Vegas Strip.  “Maybe he’s a super guy,” Lombardo said before catching himself and calling it the wrong word. “You know, a super yay-hoo that was working out all this on his own. But it would be hard for me to believe that.”  Authorities said Stephen Paddock had spent decades acquiring weapons and ammunition to ""meticulously"" plan the worst domestic attack in U.S. history. Calling him ""disturbed"" and ""dangerous,"" investigators are still trying to determine a motive. (Oct. 5)  Danley, whom authorities had previously called “a person of interest,” had been expected to provide insight into the mind of Paddock, a frustratingly opaque figure who carried out his high-rise massacre without leaving the plain-sight clues often found after major acts of bloodshed.  Lombardo said Wednesday that Paddock had 1,600 rounds of ammunition and several containers of an explosive commonly used in target shooting that totaled 50 pounds (23 kilograms) in his car. But it wasn’t clear what, if anything, Paddock planned with the explosives, he said.  Paddock, who set up surveillance cameras in his room and to see anyone approaching outside, also had an escape plan, Lombardo said, though he fatally shot himself as police closed in on his luxury suite on the 32nd-floor of the Mandalay Bay resort casino. Lombardo declined to say what led authorities to believe he planned an escape.  The previous weekend, Paddock had rented a high-rise condo in a building that overlooked the Life is Beautiful alternative music festival featuring Chance the Rapper, Muse, Lorde and Blink-182, said Lombardo, who offered no other details about what led Paddock there.  On Sept. 28, the 64-year-old high-stakes gambler and real estate investor checked into Mandalay Bay and specifically requested an upper-floor room with a view of the Route 91 Harvest music festival, according to a person who has seen hotel records turned over to investigators.  Paddock wasn’t able to move into the room until Saturday, said the person, who was not authorized to speak publicly and disclosed the information to the AP on condition of anonymity.  The room, which goes for $590, was given to Paddock for free because he was a good customer who wagered tens of thousands of dollars each time he visited the casino, the person said.  Paddock wired $100,000 to the Philippines days before the shooting, said a U.S. official who was not authorized to speak publicly because of the continuing investigation. Investigators are trying to trace that money.  Danley, who was overseas for more than two weeks, said she was initially pleased when she was wired money from Paddock to buy a house for her family in the Philippines. But she later feared it was a way to break up with her.  She said she loved Paddock as a “kind, caring, quiet man” and hoped they would have a future together. She said she was devastated by the carnage and would cooperate with authorities as they struggle to get inside Paddock’s mind.  While Paddock had a passion for high-stakes gambling at Nevada casinos, his game of choice was video poker, a relatively solitary pursuit with no dealer and no humans to play against. And while neighbors described Paddock as friendly, he wasn’t close to them.  “He was a private guy. That’s why you can’t find out anything about him,” his brother Eric Paddock said from his home in Florida. As for what triggered the massacre, the brother said, “Something happened that drove him into the pit of hell.”  Paddock had no known criminal history. Public records contained no indication of any financial problems, and his brother described him as a wealthy real estate investor.

Most warm-blooded animals, like mammals and birds, have periods of REM sleep. (Dolphins and many species of whales are notable exceptions.)  Image Michel Jouvet in 2005. Credit Michel Depardieu/Inserm  The question of whether animals dream was asked millenniums ago by Aristotle and has since occurred to virtually anyone who has watched a pet twitching in a deep sleep. Dr. Jouvet, who cautioned that there was no way for people to know for certain whether animals have what we call dreams, made a startling discovery while observing their behavior with his fellow researchers.  When certain minute structures within a cat’s pons were destroyed in experiments, he found, the cat began to move during periods of REM sleep — movements suggestive of walking, stalking prey, grooming or acting aggressively — all without reacting to outside stimuli.  The cat was exhibiting what Dr. Jouvet called “oneiric behavior,” meaning behavior related to dreams, using a word derived from the Greek word for dream, “oneiros.” He theorized that what had been destroyed in the experiments were the cerebral structures that had inhibited the cat’s motion while it was sleeping, and that the cat had been reacting to its dreams physically.  “How can we wake a cat during paradoxical sleep and ask it questions?” Dr. Jouvet wrote. “We cannot, but the discovery and analysis of oneiric behavior would lead us to believe that cats do dream.”  In 1986, many years after Dr. Jouvet’s discovery of oneiric behavior in cats, a study by Carlos Schenck and Mark Mahowald at the Minnesota Regional Sleep Disorders Center in Minneapolis pointed to a similar phenomenon in humans. The study detailed a medical condition called REM behavior disorder, in which a sleeping person acts out violently in the throes of a vivid dream. The disorder can usually be controlled with a low dose of a sedative.",4.625,4,"[4.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.5]"
1203,2801,10,30,2017,2017-10-30,Vox,“Don’t forget we still have all the Hillary activity”: GOP reacts to Manafort charges,"Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chair, was indicted for federal crimes on Monday, the biggest development yet in the investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government. It is perhaps the most significant political development of the year.  On Capitol Hill, Republicans responded as they always have: demurring and pledging not to be distracted from their goal of deep tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy, mimicking the White House’s attempts to deflect attention to investigations into Hillary Clinton or, in many cases, avoiding the questions altogether.  House Speaker Paul Ryan typified the GOP’s response: ""I really don’t have anything to add other than nothing is going to derail what we’re doing in Congress,” he said. “We’re working on solving people’s problems.”  “I don’t know enough about it,” Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UH) told reporters in the Capitol on Monday when asked about the indictments. “I do know Paul Manafort ... I’d be surprised if Paul broke any laws.”  Top Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley (IA) — who chairs the Judiciary Committee, which is investigating Russia’s alleged interference in the election — avoided the subject more dramatically. He escaped a press conference on religious liberties after a reporter inquired about Manafort, nearly knocking over the American flags set up behind the podium. In a statement earlier in the day, Grassley said “it’s important to let our legal system run its course.”  Trump has already signaled that he might be willing to fire special counsel Robert Mueller if the Russia probe goes places he doesn’t like. Republicans in Congress could take steps to protect the investigation from White House meddling. But at least for now, they are refusing to do any such thing.  “This is dicey because this is not a time to be unequivocal — bold statements are risky right now in either direction, attacking [Trump] or not,” Matt Mackowiak, a Republican strategist, told me. ""My advice to them right now would be: Be very careful not to jump the gun.""  After all, there are tax cuts to pass.  Republicans don’t want to talk about the Russia indictments  This was supposed to be a big week for Republicans in Congress: The House is set to unveil its tax overhaul bill on Wednesday, getting the ball rolling on the GOP’s top legislative priority.  Tax reform was going to be hard enough on its own. Overhauling the nation’s tax code comes with a lot of winners and losers, and as Obamacare repeal already showed, Republicans can’t just expect their members to fall in line on a major agenda item. Trump was expected to be a key player in the tax debate, providing leadership and direction from the White House.  But the indictments of Manafort and his associate Rick Gates put have shifted the spotlight back to White House scandals. Republicans will now be occupied with uncomfortable questions about the Trump campaign’s relationship with Russia and the president’s inevitable preoccupation with a probe that cuts so close to his inner circle.  In the Capitol on Friday, a number Senate Republicans deferred questions about the significance of the indictments to Mueller — even as their Democratic colleagues appeared eager to take up the question.  “That’s Robert Mueller’s wheelhouse, not ours,” Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX) said. Asked if the probe could derail the party’s tax reform push, Cornyn acknowledged worrying that it would. “That’s what we’re working on,” he said.  Similarly, Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) told reporters Monday that they should direct their questions to Mueller. Added Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN), a harsh Trump critic: “I don’t really have a reaction — it’s a little bit out of my area.”  But Trump’s congressional loyalists, like Sen. James Inhofe (R-OK), did their part in forwarding the White House’s message on the indictments: saying the charges had nothing to do with Trump and attempting to turn the focus to Hillary Clinton’s campaign.  “So far I haven’t seen that our president was a part of it or was knowledgeable about it,” Inhofe told me. “We don’t know what’s going to come. Apparently there are going to be more indictments. We will wait and see until more things are exposed. In the meantime, don’t forget we still have all the Hillary activity.”  In the House, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), who has a close relationship with the president, said he is not a “big fan” of how the investigation has played out.  “With Mueller, we don’t know what the crime is,” Meadow said. “It’s not the way you would normally think about trying to mete out justice.”  Republican could protect Mueller — but so far, they haven’t  The White House says it has no “plans” to remove Mueller for now, but Trump has raged against the indictments, and the Russia investigation altogether, seeking to turn the blame to Clinton and Democrats. If Trump were to fire Mueller in an attempt to end this investigation, the ensuing political crisis would be unmatched in recent US history.  It’s a crisis Republicans could head off — if they wanted to.  Congress has several options available for protecting Mueller’s investigation, as Vox’s Jeff Stein previously reported. At least two bipartisan bills have already been introduced that would make it harder for Trump to dismiss Mueller.  One bill is from Senate Judiciary Committee members Sens. Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Chris Coons (D-DE); the other is from Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC). They would achieve similar ends in slightly different ways: giving the federal courts oversight of a special counsel’s dismissal and mandating that Mueller could only be removed by a Senate-confirmed attorney general.  “Special counsels must act within boundaries, but they must also be protected,” Graham said in a statement when the bill was introduced this August. “Our bill allows judicial review of any decision to terminate a special counsel to make sure it’s done for the reasons cited in the regulation rather than political motivation.”  But there was no indication that Congress would take such a step, even with the stakes significantly raised after the Manafort and Gates indictments.  “I think it’s speculative at this point,” Cornyn said when asked about the congressional bill to protect Mueller.  “I don’t think that’s needed,” Sen. James Lankford (R-OK), who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said of Congress acting to protect Mueller’s position.  Clarification: Due to a spotty phone connection, Rep. Mark Meadows was misheard to have said “weed out justice” instead of “mete out justice.”",3.3333333333333335,75,"[2.0, 4.0, 4.0, 0.5, 3.5, 0.5, 3.0, 1.5, 4.5, 2.5, 3.0, 5.0, 3.0, 3.5, 2.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 5.0, 2.5, 1.0, 4.5, 4.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 0.5, 3.5, 0.5, 5.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.5, 4.5, 0.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 0.5, 5.0, 4.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0, 2.0, 5.0, 4.0, 2.5, 1.5, 3.5, 0.5, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 2.5, 4.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 2.0, 5.0, 5.0, 0.5, 4.5, 2.5, 5.0, 0.5, 0.5]"

China’s ruling Communist Party is expanding its role in business even as it promises freer markets and support for entrepreneurs on the eve of President Xi Jinping’s second five-year term as leader. The conflicting goals raise concerns that leaders might put off changes needed to reinvigorate a cooling economy that faces surging debt and trade tensions with Washington and Europe. (AP Photo/Andy Wong, File)  BEIJING (AP) — China’s ruling Communist Party is expanding its role in business even as it promises freer markets and support for entrepreneurs on the eve of President Xi Jinping’s second five-year term as leader.  Party officials are tightening their control over state-owned enterprises and want a voice in how some foreign companies are run. State companies that dominate energy and other fields are being made even bigger through mergers. Some are forming ties with private sector success stories such as tech giants Alibaba and Tencent to draw on their skills.  Beijing’s conflicting goals are raising concerns that leaders might put off changes needed to reinvigorate a cooling economy that faces surging debt and trade tensions with Washington and Europe.  “There is no grand vision. There are parallel goals that are competing with each other,” said Andrew Polk, an economist at Trivium/China, a research firm in Beijing. “We are not sure which ones are going to win out at a given moment.”  No major policy changes are expected out of the twice-a-decade party congress that is due to re-appoint Xi as general secretary. The party also will name a Standing Committee, the country’s ruling inner circle of power, in preparation for installing a new government in early 2018.  The impact of those choices, by creating jobs and business opportunities or dragging on economic activity, will take time to filter down to ordinary Chinese.  At the opening of the congress Wednesday, Xi repeated official promises to support entrepreneurs and give market forces a “decisive role” but affirmed the dominance of state-owned industry.  “There must be no irresolution about working to consolidate and develop the public sector,” said Xi in a nationally televised address.  Data released Thursday showed economic growth stayed relatively stable in the quarter ending in September, buoyed by strength in consumer spending and exports. Output rose 6.8 percent, down marginally from the previous quarter’s 6.9 percent.  Investors are watching the congress for signs of where the party wants to go and how fast. A key indicator will be which posts go to Xi allies seen as reformers with the personal authority to overcome opposition from party or state industry factions that might lose influence.  One closely watched figure is Wang Qishan, a vice premier and respected problem-solver who oversaw China’s response to SARS and at age 69 is obliged by party tradition to leave the seven-person Standing Committee. If he stays in a leadership post, analysts say that would suggest Xi wants his help to carry out painful changes.  Reform advocates complain that since Xi took power in 2012, the leadership has dragged its feet on fulfilling promises to tackle debt that has soared to dangerous levels, curb the dominance of state industry and give a bigger role to entrepreneurs who create China’s new jobs and wealth.  Instead, Xi focused on an anti-corruption campaign and tightened political control, detained activist lawyers and stepped up internet censorship.  Foreign industry groups complain China is moving too slowly on promises to shrink state-owned steel and aluminum producers they accuse of threatening jobs by flooding global markets with low-cost exports.  “Generally speaking, there has been no major progress in economic reform,” said Sheng Hong, director of the Unirule Institute, an independent economic research group in Beijing.  Regulators closed Unirule’s website and social media accounts in a crackdown in January on liberal voices.  The party’s internal conflict is reflected in a 2013 declaration that promised for the first time to give market forces the “decisive role” but also vowed the party would intensify its control of state industry. Private sector analysts say this appears to be aimed at rooting out corruption and waste.  This year, some foreign companies say the party, which already has cells in all enterprises and controls agencies that regulate them, is trying to expand its authority further by asking for a formal voice in commercial decisions.  Some 32 mainland companies with shares traded in Hong Kong have proposed changes to their legal structure to make the party an adviser to their board. Financial commentators complain this might hurt shareholders.  “This is potentially a huge problem,” said the German ambassador to China, Michael Clauss. “Many foreign companies are very alarmed.”  Foreign companies already are frustrated by rules that give them little access to industries such as finance and technology, plans they say might limit their role in promising fields such as electric cars. That pessimism helped lead to a 1.2 percent decline in investment into China in the first seven months of this year, breaking a series of annual double-digit gains.  A business leader in Wenzhou, a southeastern city known as a hotbed of private sector activity, welcomed Xi’s pledge to do more to help entrepreneurs.  “If private enterprises succeed, China’s economy succeeds,” said Zhou Dewen, president of the city’s Association for Promotion of Development of Small and Medium-sized Companies.  Beijing is pushing entrepreneurs to support state-owned enterprises, or SOEs.  The party pledged in a Sept. 25 declaration to promote “entrepreneurial spirit” while also urging entrepreneurs to learn “socialist core values.”  In August, one of the country’s three major state-owned phone carriers, China Unicom Ltd., sold an $11.7 billion stake to private investors including Alibaba Group, the biggest global e-commerce company by sales volume; Tencent Holdings Ltd., which operates the popular WeChat social media platform, and internet search giant Baidu Inc. There was no indication they would get any voice in management.  In September, Tencent paid $366 million for 5 percent of state-owned investment bank China International Capital Corp. CICC gets access to Tencent’s marketing and other skills, but the private company gained no management control.  Other state companies have announced similar plans to bring in private shareholders.  Meanwhile, authorities are discussing taking a direct state ownership stake in Alibaba and Tencent, The Wall Street Journal reported this month, citing unidentified sources.  “Supposed reforms in state-own companies such as ‘mixed ownership’ can never be called a reform,” said Sheng. “Setting up party committees in companies not only is not a reform, but is a step backward.”  In August, the government announced the merger of Shenhua Group, the world’s biggest coal producer, and Guodian Group, a major power supplier, to form the world’s biggest utility by assets.  “They are being quite clear that they want bigger, bolder, better SOEs, with not just state but party leadership,” said Polk.  The pressure for action is building.  Economic growth has been propped up this year by a lending boom and government stimulus, but that sets back official efforts to build a consumer-driven economy.  Forecasters expect growth to cool as regulators tighten lending controls to rein in debt that has risen to the equivalent of 260 percent of annual economic output — unusually high for a developing country.  “Strains within the country’s banking sector are already glaringly evident,” the Economist Intelligence Unit said in a report.  ___  AP researcher Yu Bing contributed.",3.1145833333333335,48,"[4.0, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.0, 1.5, 3.5, 5.0, 1.5, 5.0, 4.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 2.5, 0.5, 2.5, 3.5, 2.0, 5.0, 1.5, 5.0, 2.5, 3.5, 0.5, 3.5, 4.5, 0.5, 2.5, 3.0, 5.0, 3.0, 0.5, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 3.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 2.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.5, 1.0]"

Trump and Vice President Mike Pence came out recently with statements on opioids and humanitarian aid that appear big, bold and immediate. An AP Fact Check finds there’s less than meets the eye to them. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)  WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump and his vice president came out this past week with initiatives that are not as big, bold or immediate as they appeared.  Despite the drum-roll implied in Mike Pence’s recent remarks to Christians, the U.S. is not suddenly walking away from U.N. humanitarian relief programs and switching all that money directly to persecuted religious groups. And Trump’s action on the opioid epidemic counts on a powerful anti-drug punch from advertising, a feeble weapon at least in the past.  A look at their statements and other rhetoric from the week:  TRUMP on a planned ad campaign against the opioid epidemic: “I think that’s going to end up being our most important thing. Really tough, really big, really great advertising, so we get to people before they start.” — remarks Thursday.  THE FACTS: He may prove history wrong, but past marketing efforts to scare young people from using drugs had poor results. More broadly, Trump’s declaration of opioid overdoses as a public health emergency is not as consequential as it might sound. It does not bring new dollars to the anti-opioids fight. It does make it easier for the government to shuffle resources and make other changes, such as expanding access to medical services in rural areas.  U.S. President Donald Trump declares the opioid crisis a nationwide public health emergency - a step that won't bring new dollars to fight a scourge that kills nearly 100 Americans a day but will expand access to medical services in rural areas. (Oct. 26)  As for advertising, the government spent nearly $1 billion from 1998 to 2004 on a campaign to discourage illegal drug use by young people. A study financed by the National Institutes of Health concluded in 2008 that the campaign “had no favorable effects on youths’ behavior” and may have prompted some to experiment with drugs, an unintended “boomerang” effect.  A 2009 review of 20 studies of school-based D.A.R.E. programs found that students in the programs were about as likely to try drugs as those who didn’t. Founded in the early 1980s, D.A.R.E sent police officers into thousands of U.S. schools to warn about the dangers of drugs.  More recently, anti-drug campaigns have appealed to teenagers’ desire for independence and self-control rather than drug fears. A 2011 study of the government’s “Above the Influence” campaign suggested eighth-graders who had seen the campaign were slightly less likely to have tried marijuana than those who had not.  ___  PENCE, on redirecting U.S. humanitarian foreign aid: “While faith-based groups with proven track records and deep roots in these communities are more than willing to assist, the United Nations too often denies their funding requests. My friends, those days are over. ... . Tonight, it is my privilege to announce that President Trump has ordered the State Department to stop funding ineffective relief efforts at the United Nations. And from this day forward, America will provide support directly to persecuted communities through USAID.” — remarks Wednesday to a group helping Christians in the Middle East.  THE FACTS: “From this day forward” is a stretch, as are Pence’s other references to immediate change. The government is to study the matter. Studies take time, especially when multiple agencies are involved, and lead to conclusions that can’t always be foreseen at the start.  State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said not all U.N. relief programs would be cut off from U.S. financing. “The U.N. will still get some of its money for this, but we will look for other avenues in which to more efficiently fund these types of religious minorities so that they can eventually return back home,” Nauert said.  A White House official says the goal is to make sure necessary levels of relief are steered to persecuted religious minorities in the Middle East and as part of that, more grants will go directly to religious organizations and other groups. An analysis will be done by the State Department, U.S. Agency for International Development and the Office of Management and Budget, in conjunction with the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., “to determine how appropriated funds can best be spent,” the official said. This background was shared on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to be identified.  ___  Also from this past week:  TRUMP: “Bob Corker, who helped President O give us the bad Iran Deal & couldn’t get elected dog catcher in Tennessee, is now fighting Tax Cuts....” And: “Corker dropped out of the race in Tennesse when I refused to endorse him, and now is only negative on anything Trump. Look at his record!” — tweets Tuesday.  THE FACTS: Trump, who spelled Tennessee right the first time, continues to label the Republican senator an enabler of the Iran nuclear deal when he was a leading critic of it. Corker had nothing to do with the 2015 international agreement forged by the U.S. and other world powers to constrain Iran’s ability to build a nuclear arsenal. He argued at the time that President Barack Obama should have made the international pact a treaty subject to approval by the Senate. When Obama didn’t do that, Corker helped fellow senators write legislation that subjected the accord to periodic congressional review. The legislation would have blocked the deal if that effort got enough votes. It didn’t. Obama brought the deal into effect, not Congress.  On Corker’s political fate, Trump actually urged Corker to stand for re-election next year during a private meeting in September, the AP learned. And Corker’s chief of staff, Todd Womack, said Trump called Corker after that to ask that he reconsider his decision to leave the Senate. Trump “reaffirmed that he would have endorsed him, as he has said many times,” the aide said. Trump has not substantiated his competing claim that he withheld an endorsement of Corker and that’s why the senator decided to leave Washington.  ___  Trump, on a contract landed by Boeing from Singapore Airlines: “In terms of the orders it’s about $13.8 billion and most importantly it’s about 70,000 jobs.” — at the signing of a “certificate of purchase” staged at the White House on Monday.  THE FACTS: Yes, but.  Boeing says the order will “sustain” more than 70,000 direct and indirect U.S. jobs for the company, its suppliers and others. The company did not say they were new jobs. The estimate of jobs and the value of the contract is based on full list price of the 39 planes Singapore Airlines has agreed to buy. Airlines routinely receive deep discounts from the list price of planes. So the contract, while unquestionably a big one, may end up worth less than $13.8 billion and have a less dramatic effect on employment than billed.  The contract wasn’t as new as it appeared: Singapore Airlines announced Feb. 9 that it signed a letter of intent to order the 39 planes from a U.S. manufacturer. Boeing booked the order in June but did not identify the buyer until this past week. Given the lengthy negotiations involved in airline purchases, it’s clear the order — announced by Singapore Airlines less than three weeks after Trump was sworn in — largely came together when Barack Obama was president. It’s unlikely either president had much to do with it.  ___  Associated Press writers Darlene Superville, Josh Lederman, Ken Thomas, Jill Colvin and Matthew Perrone in Washington and David Koenig in Dallas contributed to this report.  ___  Find AP Fact Checks at https://apnews.com/tag/APFactCheck",3.65,10,"[2.5, 4.5, 4.0, 2.5, 2.5, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 0.5]"
1023,2585,10,25,2017,2017-10-25,The New York Times,Tax Cuts Are the Glue Holding a Fractured Republican Party Together,"On Wednesday, Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, acknowledged a long list of still-unresolved issues in the House’s draft bill, which is to be released Nov. 1. They included where to place the income limits for various tax brackets, whether to maintain or cut tax rates on top earners, and the fate of several critical components of the revamped corporate code.  Two issues in dispute flared up publicly: changes to retirement savings and to individuals’ ability to deduct their state and local taxes.  Mr. Brady seemed to defend a proposal to drastically lower the cap on tax-free retirement account contributions. He indicated that there were better ways to encourage the bulk of workers to save, even after Mr. Trump declared on Monday that “there will be NO change to your 401(k).”  “Right now, we are not a nation of savers,” Mr. Brady said at a breakfast convened by The Christian Science Monitor, adding: “We think in tax reform we can create incentives for Americans to save more and save sooner.”  Privately, though, a member of House leadership assured lobbyists on Wednesday that retirement account limits would not be touched in the draft bill.  House Republicans have been considering sharply reducing the amount that Americans are allowed to save, before taxes, in 401(k) retirement plans to $2,400 a year, from the current $18,000, or $24,000 for workers who are over 50. Lowering the cap would be unlikely to encourage more savings, research suggests, but it would amount to an accounting maneuver that would help Republicans make up some of the lost revenue from large cuts to business tax rates. Money in such retirement accounts is taxed when it is withdrawn.

Carlos Curbelo (R-FL) introduced gun control aimed at law-abiding Americans on Tuesday. His bill has nine Republican co-sponsors, which means nine Republicans are willing to punish every law-abiding American for the behavior of one criminal in Las Vegas.  And they are doing all this to ban bump stocks, a product the ATF evaluated and approved in 2010.  The ATF approved the stocks because they are accessories for semiautomatics rather than conversion devices that turn semiautomatics into fully automatic weapons. Curbelo’s bill gets around the ATF’s approval by explicitly banning certain accessories for AR-15s, even if those accessories “[do] not convert the semiautomatic rifle into a machine gun.”  And like the Democrat bill–put forward by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA)–Curbelo’s bill is already broader than bump stocks alone. In other words, it is a ban that will keep on giving for the Democrats and other gun control proponents.  Here are the nine Republicans who are co-sponsoring Curbelo’s bill:  Rep. Peter King (R-NY) Rep. Leonard Lance (R-NJ) Rep. Patrick Meehan (R-PA) Rep, Ed Royce (R-CA) Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ) Rep. Erik Paulsen (R-MN) Rep. Ryan Costello (R-PA) Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL) Rep. Charlie Dent (R-PA)  The push to ban bump stocks is especially rich in light of the fact that using the devices probably made the Vegas attacker less effective than he would have been without them. After all, bump stocks are made for novelty rather than precision. For this reason, U.S. Army Sergeant First Class special forces soldier Tony Cowden suggests the Vegas attacker could have been deadlier if he had shot slower with a rifle not outfitted with a bump stock:  Bump stocks may have made Paddock less deadly https://t.co/90ddK51Y8w pic.twitter.com/eC42rf8k11 — Justin Miller (@justinjm1) October 4, 2017  Moreover, the effect one achieves with a bump stock can be achieved with an index finger and a belt-loop; no bump stock device needed. So what will Republican gun controllers do if they ban bump stocks and realize that people are still having fun with their rifles via blue jean belt loops? Will they ban belt loops?  In summary–Bump stocks are accessories, not conversion kits. They are novelties that reduce accuracy by producing a short, rapid-fire effect that can be achieved using nothing more than a finger and belt loop. For these reasons, Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) stresses that bump stock gun control is part of a larger misdirection that creates a “slippery slope” Democrats can exploit for more gun control in the future. Yet Reps. Peter King, Leonard Lance, Patrick Meehan, Ed Royce, Chris Smith, Erik Paulsen, Ryan Costello, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and Charlie Dent are rallying behind Curbelo’s gun control bill.

Bannon was speaking at an event organized by the institute: “Countering Violent Extremism: Qatar, Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood” in Washington, D.C. Bannon was referring to the Arab Islamic American Summit held in Saudi Arabia in May, where Trump met with Arab leaders to organize a united front against ISIS and to stop the financing of terrorism.  Bannon said that specifically, the point of the summit was to stop the financing of the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas, and also Iran’s aggressive anti-Western strategy.  ‘I don’t think it’s just by happenstance that two weeks after that summit that you saw the blockade of the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain [and] Egypt and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on Qatar,” he said.  Just eight months into Trump’s term, Bannon also noted, ISIS has largely been wiped out after major defeats in Mosul, Iraq, and Raqqa, Syria. The latter is arguably a more significant defeat for the terror group as Raqqa was the group’s de facto capital in the Middle East. But last week it fell to U.S.-backed troops.  As Breitbart News reported last week, analysts caution that ISIS has not been destroyed, but with these twin defeats, it has been broken down from a terror state back into a terrorist organization.  Bannon noted that despite Trump being criticized during the campaign for his perceived lack of foreign policy knowledge, he has achieved a victory that would have been seen as almost impossible just a year ago.  “President Trump has accomplished something that I think people would have mocked and laughed at him in the campaign,” Bannon said. “Raqqa fell the other day, the physical destruction of ISIS’s caliphate, which shocked the world with its rapid rise.”  He put the victory down to changing the strategy from a war of attrition, to a war of annihilation.  “In eight months of President Trump’s strategy, executed by General Mattis, and that strategy was not a war of attrition, he was very specific from day one, this is a war of annihilation: ‘we will annihilate the caliphate’ and that’s been accomplished,” he said.

X-ray technology was used to reveal the ghostly unfinished portrait of the Scottish Queen, who reigned from 1542 to 1567. Convicted of treason against Queen Elizabeth I of England, she was beheaded at Fotheringay Castle in England in 1587.  Mary’s portrait was painted over with a portrait of Sir John Maitland, 1st Lord Maitland of Thirlestane. The 1589 painting of Maitland, who was Lord Chancellor of Scotland, has been attributed to the Dutch artist Adrian Vanson.  LONG-LOST DARK AGE KINGDOM DISCOVERED IN SOUTHERN SCOTLAND  Mary’s hidden portrait was discovered by Dr. Caroline Rae, a research fellow at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London. Working with National Galleries of Scotland, Rae examined the painting using x-ray technology, which penetrates layers of paint but does not penetrate pigments containing heavy metals such as lead white, a white pigment that was used in paintings of that time.  The x-ray reveals the shadowy outline of a woman, who experts believe is Mary, Queen of Scots, based on other depictions of the controversial queen.  After abdicating the Scottish throne amid suspicions that she was implicated in her husband’s murder, Mary was imprisoned from 1568 until her death by her cousin Elizabeth I, who perceived her as a threat.  RARE ROMAN COIN DISCOVERED ON REMOTE SCOTTISH ISLAND  In a statement, Rae described the discovery of the hidden portrait as an “exciting revelation.”  Vanson’s portrait of Sir John Maitland usually hangs in Ham House, near London, but is part of a new display that opens Oct. 28 at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh.  The fact that Mary’s portrait was painted over with a portrait of Sir John Maitland just two years after her execution may reflect someone’s desire to distance themselves from the Scottish queen.  TEENAGER'S DISCOVERY OF ROMAN TREASURE TROVE DELIGHTS EXPERTS  “Vanson’s portrait of Sir John Maitland is an important picture in the National Trust collection, and the remarkable discovery of the unfinished portrait of Mary, Queen of Scots adds an exciting hidden dimension to it,” said David Taylor, curator of pictures and sculpture at the National Trust, which owns Ham House. “It shows that portraits of the queen were being copied and presumably displayed in Scotland around the time of her execution, a highly contentious and potentially dangerous thing to be seen doing.”  The portrait discovery is just the latest fascinating find to shed new light on Scotland’s rich history. Earlier this year, for example, experts announced the discovery of a rare Roman coin on a remote island in the Orkney archipelago. Archaeologists and volunteers also found the location of a long-lost early medieval kingdom in southern Scotland.  In 2014, a stunning hoard of ancient silver, believed to have been used as bribes by Romans, was discovered with a metal detector by a teenager in Dairsie, in the Scottish region of Fife.

I want a real simple way to see what’s available on Amazon vs. Apple vs. Hulu vs. YouTube vs. Roku and all the others!  A: There are so many different streaming services available, and each provides a different blend of programming. As you’ve pointed out, it’s hard to tell what flicks and shows are available on each service, especially when titles appear and vanish so unpredictably. You’ll be happy to hear that several different sites have answered the call and can summarize these streaming catalogs at a glance. Click here for easy-to-follow guides to streaming content.  Adjust TV volume  Q: The dialogue on my TV is awful. I can hardly hear people, but the sounds are loud. How can I fix this?  A: When you bring a new TV into your home, it arrives with a lot of arbitrary settings: tint, color, contrast and so on. The volume controls are nearly as important as the picture, because they can dramatically affect the sound of the dialogue, ambient noise and music. There are many ways to fix this problem, but if you’re not accustomed to working with speakers and acoustics, you’ll need a little guidance. Click here to learn about a hidden volume setting.  Comparing smart temperature controls  Q: I was thinking about getting a smart thermostat to save money on heating bills. Is the Nest or Ecobee the better choice?  A: Most of our monthly energy bills relate to the heating and cooling of our homes, and the smarter your thermostat is, the less energy you’ll use. The exciting part of both systems is that they will automatically adapt to your household’s needs. You just have to set the thermostat to its regular settings for about a week, and the internal computer will figure out the rest. Both systems are excellent, but there are a few clear differences.

During his brief press conference, Trump confirmed that he is already working to eliminate the State Department’s Diversity Visa program that brought the NYC terrorist to America and ironically, was the brainchild of Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY). He’s also not shy about saying he’d be willing to send the NYC terrorist to GITMO.  President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he would consider sending Sayfullo Saipov, the Uzbek national who plowed a rented truck through a bike lane full of cyclists and pedestrians on Tuesday, to the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  ‘I would certainly consider that, yes. I would certainly consider that. Send him to Gitmo,’ Trump said.

Kushner reportedly advised the president to fire Comey, over the advice of some other senior advisers, and was present during a weekend when the president drafted a letter to fire the director.  The questioning of Kushner’s role in Comey’s firing signals that Mueller has moved past the campaign and is looking at whether there was any obstruction of justice in firing the former FBI director, who was then leading the Russia probe. Kushner is reportedly not a target of the investigation.  The 36-year-old voluntarily turned over documents from the campaign and from the transition, which were similar to ones he had given congressional investigators earlier this year.  A White House official told CNN that the special counsel’s questions about Kushner are not a surprise.  How much of a factor Kushner played in Comey’s firing is a point of dispute within the White House, with some sources telling CNN he had no influence and others calling him the “driver” of the decision.  Kushner has denied any collusion or wrongdoing during or after the election season.  Kushner has come under scrutiny for attending a meeting with a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower, which was set up under the premise that she had dirt on Hillary Clinton. During the meeting, the lawyer reportedly lobbied Donald Trump, Jr., Kushner, and then-campaign chair Paul Manafort on overturning the Magnitsky Act.  Kushner was also under scrutiny for meetings with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. and a Russian banker, and for failing to list hundreds of meetings with foreign contacts on his security clearance forms, which he blamed on an assistant.

1491,3159,11,7,2017,2017-11-07,Fox News,Veteran unemployment rates fall to record low in October,"The unemployment rate for military veterans in October reached a low of just 2.7 percent, continuing a long-term downward trend in unemployment among members of the U.S. Armed Services.  Mirroring October’s overall drop in unemployment, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the improved numbers offset a decline in September that largely reflected the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Harvey in Florida and Texas.  While the unemployment rate for veterans only dropped 0.3 percent between September and October, the rate was down from 4.3 percent in October 2016 and from almost 10 percent in 2010.  For veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan – referred to as post-9/11 veterans – the unemployment rate was 3.6 percent, compared to 4.7 percent in October 2016, and 10.2 percent in 2009.  The White House used the dropping unemployment rates -- overall jobless rate ticked down to a 17-year low of 4.1 percent in October – to tout President Trump’s plans to jump-start the economy.  ""Numbers are phenomenal over the last year — since November 8th, Election Day,” Trump told business leaders in Tokyo on Monday. “Our unemployment is at a 17-year low. We've gotten almost 2 million more people in the workforce in just that short period of time. I've reduced regulations terrifically, frankly, if I do say so myself.”  Observers, however, caution that the drop in unemployment is due in part to many Americans giving up searching for work — one of the criticisms Trump made of President Obama's record during the 2016 campaign. Many of the economic figures Trump cites are advancing a recovery from the Great Recession that dates back to the middle of 2009.  As for the stock market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average returned to its previous peak in March 2013 and has been setting records ever since.

Just 24 percent of Americans say the country is heading in the right direction after a tumultuous stretch for Trump. That's according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Just 24 percent of Americans believe the country is heading in the right direction after a tumultuous stretch for President Donald Trump that included the threat of war with North Korea, stormy complaints about hurricane relief and Trump’s equivocating about white supremacists. That’s a 10-point drop since June, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.  The decline in optimism about the nation’s trajectory is particularly pronounced among Republicans. In June, 60 percent of Republicans said the country was headed in the right direction; now it’s just 44 percent.  The broader picture for the president is grim, too. Nearly 70 percent of Americans say Trump isn’t level-headed, and majorities say he’s not honest or a strong leader. More than 60 percent disapprove of how he is handling race relations, foreign policy and immigration, among other issues.  Overall, 67 percent of Americans disapprove of the job Trump is doing in office, including about one-third of Republicans.  Tracy Huelsman, a 40-year-old from Louisville, Kentucky, is among them. A self-described moderate Republican, Huelsman said she’s particularly concerned about the “divisiveness” she feels the president promotes on social media.  “It’s scary in 2017 that we are in what seems like a worse place in terms of division,” said Huelsman, who did not vote for Trump in last year’s election.  The assessments come after a turbulent summer for Trump that included a major White House shake-up, bringing the departure of his chief of staff, top strategist and press secretary. While the installment of retired Marine Gen. John Kelly as chief of staff has ushered in more day-to-day order in the West Wing, the president has still stirred up numerous controversies, including when he blamed “both sides” for the clashes between white supremacists and counter-protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia.  Trump has also raised the specter of a military conflict with North Korea over its nuclear provocations. He’s derided North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong Un, as “rocket man,” including during a speech at the United Nations, and has downplayed the prospects that diplomatic negotiations with Kim could yield results.  Despite his electoral success, Trump struggled as both a candidate and now as president to broaden his base of support beyond his ardent supporters. The loyalty of his core backers has been enough to keep Republican lawmakers largely in line, but party operatives are closely watching Trump’s support among GOP and independent voters ahead of next year’s midterm elections, when the balance of power in Congress will be at stake.  To be sure, lawmakers have their own problems to worry about. Americans have even less esteem for Congress than Trump, with just 18 percent saying they approve of the job being done by the House and the Senate.  Republicans took another hit last month when they failed — for a second time this year — to pass an overhaul of the nation’s health care law. GOP leaders tried to rush votes on the complicated legislation, leaving many voters unsure of what was in the package.  “They never seemed to present a bill to people that you could actually look at the details of and the pluses and minuses of it,” said Dennis Cronin, a 67-year-old independent from Wenham, Massachusetts.  The GOP failure on health care has irritated Trump, who promised voters that repealing “Obamacare” would be easy. Americans aren’t happy with his progress on health care either; 68 percent disapprove of his handling of the issue.  Of all the issues surveyed by the AP-NORC poll, the president performs slightly better on the economy. But even there, 56 percent disapprove of the job he’s doing and just 42 percent say they approve.  On Friday, the Labor Department announced that the U.S. shed 33,000 jobs in September because of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which closed thousands of businesses in Texas and Florida and forced widespread evacuations. It marked the first monthly hiring drop in nearly seven years.  Ninety-two percent of Democrats and 69 percent of independents say Trump understands the problems of people like them not very or not at all well. Even among Republicans, only 42 percent say he understands them very well, while 32 percent say he does moderately well.  The AP-NORC poll of 1,150 adults was conducted Sept. 28-Oct. 2 using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.

The founder of a Chinese online peer-to-peer lender has been sentenced to life in prison Tuesday, Sept. 12, 2017, on charges he defrauded investors of $7.7 billion in one of China's biggest financial scams. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein, File)  BEIJING (AP) — The founder of a Chinese online peer-to-peer lender has been sentenced to life in prison on charges he defrauded investors of $7.7 billion in one of China’s biggest financial scams.  Ezubo was the biggest competitor in an informal finance industry that Chinese authorities allowed to flourish with little oversight over the past decade to support entrepreneurs who cannot get loans from state banks. A series of lenders have collapsed as economic growth slowed, leaving authorities struggling to defuse protests by depositors.  Ezubo’s founder, Ding Ning, and his younger brother, Ding Dian, were sentenced Tuesday to life by the Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People’s Court for “fundraising fraud,” according to the official Xinhua News Agency.  It said another 24 executives were sentenced to prison terms ranging from three to 15 years.  Two companies affiliated with Ezubo were fined a total of 1.9 billion yuan ($291 million), Xinhua said. It said some defendants also were convicted of offenses including smuggling precious metals and illegal gun possession.  Regulators seized Ezubo in December 2015 on charges of taking deposits without a license. Xinhua said authorities have confiscated the company’s assets to repay depositors but gave no indication how much money was recovered.  Regulators allowed private sector lending to support entrepreneurs who create China’s new jobs and wealth but are largely shut out of lending by the state-owned banking industry. The national bank regulator estimated in 2015 the industry had grown to $1.5 trillion.  Beijing tightened control as defaults mounted following the 2008 financial crisis. The finance industry as a whole has come under tougher scrutiny after a plunge in stock prices in 2015 led to accusations of insider trading and other offenses.  Ding, 34, was a high school dropout who worked at his mother’s hardware factory, where he gained experience running online sales, according to media reports. With no technical or financial training, Ding launched Ezubo in July 2014 and opened marketing offices across China.  Ezubo appeared to gain Beijing’s endorsement when the Cabinet website, gov.cn, published an interview with Ding discussing his life as an entrepreneur. That interview has since been removed.  The seizure of Ezubo prompted protests by depositors who complained the government failed to protect them.  Depositors traveled to Beijing to protest at government offices and the headquarters of state television, which had broadcast advertisements for Ezubo.  Ezubo attracted deposits by promising returns of 9 to 14.6 percent, according to investigators. But authorities say a former executive admitted 95 percent of those borrowers were fictional entities created by Ezubo. In a confession broadcast by state television in February 2016, the executive called the company “a fraud ... a typical Ponzi scheme.”  The court said Ding and other defendants “inflicted huge losses on investors in many parts of China and disrupted the national financial management system,” according to Xinhua.  The internet has helped lenders attract money from working class or rural depositors, many of them financial novices with little knowledge of the risks involved.  After Ezubo depositors poured out their anger on Chinese social media, police phoned some internet users to warn them against criticizing the Communist Party online.

The Standard & Poor's rating agency cut China's credit rating on Thursday, Sept. 21, 2017 due to its rising debts, highlighting challenges faced by Communist leaders as they cope with slowing economic growth. (AP Photo/Andy Wong)  BEIJING (AP) — China’s Finance Ministry on Friday criticized the cut in the Standard & Poor’s rating agency’s credit rating on Chinese government borrowing as a “wrong decision” and said it ignores the country’s economic strength.  S&P announced the change Thursday, citing rising debt it said increased financial risk. The move added to warnings China’s debt burden might drag on economic growth or threaten the financial system. It followed a similar downgrade by Moody’s Investors Service in May.  The timing is awkward for the ruling Communist Party, which wants to project an image of stability ahead of a twice-a-decade congress next month at which President Xi Jinping is due to be named to a second five-year term as leader.  S&P followed its China downgrade a day later by cutting its credit rating for Hong Kong, citing risks posed by their close ties. The agency said Friday it was reducing its long-term rating on Hong Kong by one notch, to AA+ from AAA, reflecting potential spillover risks.  It said Hong Kong has a good economic outlook, sizable fiscal reserves and credible monetary policy, but that China’s downgrade is “exerting a negative impact” on Hong Kong because of “strong institutional and political ties” between them.  The Finance Ministry complained S&P ignored China’s stable economic growth and reform efforts. It noted official data showed the economy grew by 6.9 percent in the first half of 2017 over a year earlier and government revenue rose by nearly 10 percent.  “The Standard & Poor’s downgrade of China’s sovereign credit rating is a wrong decision,” the ministry said on its website. “This misreading neglects China’s good fundamentals and development potential.”  Total Chinese nongovernment debt rose last year to the equivalent of 257 percent of annual economic output, according to the Bank for International Settlements. That is unusually high for a developing country and up from 143 percent in 2008.  Communist leaders have cited reducing financial risk as a priority this year. They have launched initiatives to reduce debts owed by state companies, including by allowing banks to accept stock as repayment on loans. But private sector analysts say they are moving too slowly.  S&P lowered its rating on China’s sovereign debt by one notch from AA- to A+, still among its highest ratings.  “A prolonged period of strong credit growth has increased China’s economic and financial risks,” said S&P in a statement. That has supported economic growth but “also diminished financial stability to some extent.”  The downgrade could raise Beijing’s borrowing costs slightly but is more significant for its impact on investor sentiment.  “The new rating is still squarely investment grade — there is no real concern about the possibility of default,” said Mark Williams of Capital Economics in a report.  “However, credit continues to expand at a faster pace than output, which points to significant ongoing misallocation of resources,” said Williams. “State sector reforms have continued to disappoint and so the hidden risks on bank balance sheets have continued to build.”  Chinese economic growth fell from 14.2 percent in 2007 to 6.7 percent last year, though that still was among the world’s strongest.  The government is trying to make the economy more productive by giving market forces a bigger role. It is trying to shrink bloated industries such as steel and cement in which supply exceeds demand, which has depressed prices and led to financial losses.  Beijing is trying to steer the economy to slower, more sustainable growth based on domestic consumption instead of investment and exports. But growth has dipped faster than planners wanted, raising the risk of politically dangerous job losses. Beijing has responded by flooding the economy with credit.  Official efforts to rein in debt “could stabilize the trend of financial risk,” S&P said. “However, we foresee that credit growth in the next two to three years will remain at levels that will increase financial risks gradually.”",2.5,5,"[1.5, 3.5, 4.0, 2.0, 1.5]"

John Connally of Texas and his wife were on jump seats in front of the president. President Donald Trump is caught in a push-pull on new details of Kennedy’s assassination, jammed between students of the killing who want every scrap of information and intelligence agencies that are said to be counseling restraint. How that plays out should be known on Oct. 26, 2017, when long-secret files are expected to be released. (Warren Commission via AP)  WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump blocked the release of hundreds of records on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, bending to CIA and FBI appeals, while the National Archives came out Thursday night with a hefty cache of others.  “I have no choice,” Trump said in a memo, citing “potentially irreversible harm” to national security if he were to allow all records to come out now. He placed those files under a six-month review while letting 2,800 others come out, racing a deadline to honor a law mandating their release.  The documents approved for release capture the frantic days after the Nov. 22, 1963, assassination, during which federal agents madly chased after tips, however thin, juggled rumors and sifted through leads worldwide.  They include cables, notes and reports stamped “Secret” that reveal the suspicions of the era — around Cubans and Communists. They cast a wide net over varied activities of the Kennedy administration, such as its covert efforts to upend Fidel Castro’s government in Cuba.  For historians, it’s a chance to answer lingering questions, put some unfounded conspiracy theories to rest, perhaps give life to other theories.  Prof. Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia said it was ""ridiculous"" that so much time has passed since the assassination of President John F. Kennedy without the public release of documents. (Oct. 24)  Despite having months to prepare for disclosures that have been set on the calendar for 25 years, Trump’s decision came down to a last-minute debate with intelligence agencies — a tussle the president then prolonged by calling for still more review.  The delay sparked a round of finger-pointing among agencies and complaints that Trump should have released all records.  Roger Stone, a sometime Trump adviser who wrote a book about his theories on the assassination, urged Trump to review personally any material that government agencies still want to withhold. Trump should at least “spot check” any extensive redactions to make sure agencies are not “dabbling in acts of criminal insubordination,” Stone said in a statement.  As for the unreleased documents, Trump will impress upon federal agencies that “only in the rarest cases” should JFK files stay secret after the six-month review, officials said.  In the meantime, experts will be poring through a mountain of minutiae and countless loose threads in search of significant revelations.  In the chaotic aftermath of the assassination, followed two days later by the murder of the shooter, Lee Harvey Oswald while in police custody, FBI Director J, Edgar Hoover vented his frustration in a formerly secret report found in the files. It opened: “There is nothing further on the Oswald case except that he is dead.”  But, reflecting on Oswald less than an hour after he died, Hoover already sensed theories would form about a conspiracy broader than the lone assassin.  “The thing I am concerned about, and so is (deputy attorney general) Mr. Katzenbach, is having something issued so we can convince the public that Oswald is the real assassin,” he said.  He also reported: “Last night we received a call from our Dallas office from a man talking in a calm voice and saying he was a member of a committee organized to kill Oswald.”  Hoover said he relayed that warning to Dallas police and was assured Oswald would be sufficiently protected. Oswald was shot dead the next day by Jack Ruby.  The following message will be displayed to users with unsupported browsers: Your browser does not support the iframe HTML tag.

A document from 1975 contains a partial deposition by Richard Helms, a deputy CIA director under Kennedy who later became CIA chief, to the Rockefeller Commission, which was studying unauthorized CIA activities in domestic affairs. Commission lawyers appeared to be probing for information on what foreign leaders might have been the subject of assassination attempts by or on behalf of the CIA.  A lawyer asks Helms: “Is there any information involved with the assassination of President Kennedy which in any way shows that Lee Harvey Oswald was in some way a CIA agent or agent” — here the document ends, short of his answer.  Among the files is a more than 400-page document that appeared to describe people being monitored as potential threats to Kennedy and his successor, Lyndon B. Johnson.  Officials described one such person this way: “Subject participated in pickets against JFK in 1961. Allegedly trained in guerrilla tactics & sabotage. Considered very dangerous by those who know him. Has visited USA & Cuba. Considered armed and dangerous.”  Some suspicions missed the mark badly.  One document describes a person who sent a letter to Johnson in December 1963 stating “you’re doomed.” The document says: “Interviewed 1/23/64; friendly. Said letter was a joke. Not dangerous. Attending 5th grade.”  The collection also discloses a Sept. 14, 1962, meeting of a group of Kennedy’s senior aides, including brother Robert, the attorney general, as they discussed a range of options against Castro’s communist government.  The meeting was told the CIA would look into the possibility of sabotaging airplane parts that were to be shipped to Cuba from Canada. McGeorge Bundy, JFK’s national security adviser, cautioned that sensitive ideas like sabotage would have to be considered in more detail on a case-by-case basis.  Much of Thursday passed with nothing from the White House or National Archives except silence, leaving unclear how the government would comply with a law requiring the records to come out by the end of the day — unless Trump was persuaded by intelligence agencies to hold some back.  White House officials said the FBI and CIA made the most requests within the government to withhold some information.  Trump ordered agencies that have proposed withholding material related to the assassination to report to the archivist by next March 12 on which specific information meets the standard for continued secrecy.  That standard includes details that could cause “harm to the military defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement or conduct of foreign relations,” Trump wrote in his order. The archivist will have two weeks to tell Trump whether those recommendations validate keeping the withheld information a secret after April 26.  The full record will still be kept from the public for at least six months — and longer if agencies make a persuasive enough case for continued secrecy.  The collection includes more than 3,100 records — comprising hundreds of thousands of pages — that have never been seen by the public. About 30,000 documents were released previously — with redactions.  Whatever details are released, they’re not expected to give a definitive answer to a question that still lingers for some: Whether anyone other than Oswald was involved in the assassination.  The Warren Commission in 1964 concluded that Oswald had been the lone gunman, and another congressional probe in 1979 found no evidence to support the theory that the CIA had been involved. But other interpretations, some more creative than others, have persisted.  ___  Associated Press writers Alanna Durkin Richer in Boston and Laurie Kellman in Washington contributed to this report.",3.1666666666666665,3,"[5.0, 1.0, 3.5]"

Marc E. Elias, a lawyer representing the Clinton campaign and the DNC, retained Fusion GPS, a Washington firm, to conduct the research.  After that, Fusion GPS hired dossier author Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer with ties to the FBI and the U.S. intelligence community, according to those people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.  “UNKNOWN REPUBLICAN CLIENT”  Elias and his law firm, Perkins Coie, retained the company in April 2016 on behalf of the Clinton campaign and the DNC. Before that agreement, Fusion GPS’s research into Trump was funded by an unknown Republican client during the GOP primary.  The Clinton campaign and the DNC, through the law firm, continued to fund Fusion GPS’s research through the end of October 2016, days before Election Day.  Fusion GPS gave Steele’s reports and other research documents to Elias, the people familiar with the matter said. It is unclear how or how much of that information was shared with the campaign and the DNC and who in those organizations was aware of the roles of Fusion GPS and Steele. One person close to the matter said the campaign and the DNC were not informed by the law firm of Fusion GPS’s role.  The dossier has become a lightning rod amid the intensifying investigations into the Trump campaign’s possible connections to Russia. Some congressional Republican leaders have spent months trying to discredit Fusion GPS and Steele and tried to determine the identity of the Democrat or organization that paid for the dossier.  THANKS TO TRUMP’S PRESSURE, THE TRUTH CAME OUT:  Trump tweeted as recently as Saturday that the Justice Department and FBI should “immediately release who paid for it.”  Elias and Fusion GPS declined to comment on the arrangement. Spokesmen for the Clinton campaign and the DNC had no immediate comment.  Some of the details are included in a Tuesday letter sent by Perkins Coie to a lawyer representing Fusion GPS, telling the research firm that it was released from a ­client-confidentiality obligation. The letter was prompted by a legal fight over a subpoena for Fusion GPS’s bank records.  People involved in the matter said that they would not disclose the dollar amounts paid to Fusion GPS but that the campaign and the DNC shared the cost.

The article, written by Arwa Mahdawi, criticized popular LGBT conservatives, including former OUT Magazine employee Chadwick Moore, who was fired after coming out as a conservative, and the Log Cabin Republicans, attempting to paint right-wing LGBT men and women as an “influential group of gay, white, and financially well-off men,” made up of Nazis, white nationalists, and misogynists.

In her article, Mahdawi also attacked Israel, who she claimed “has long used pink-washing to help sanitize its treatment of Palestinians.”  Mahdawi didn’t, however, mention that LGBT Jews have been repeatedly discriminated against this year at Pride events.  In June, Jewish attendees at the Chicago Dyke March were kicked out of the event for carrying Jewish LGBT pride flags, while the journalist who broke the story lost her job for reporting on it.  “Let’s be clear: racism and misogyny in the queer community is nothing new. Nor is the pink-washing of white nationalism,” claimed Mahdawi in her article. “Nevertheless, in the past year, the trend has become much more pronounced, and it’s disturbing to see so many gay people buy into the idea that our ability to come out depends on keeping brown people out.”  “Some people might argue that the increase in rightwing LGBTQ people represents a move away from identity politics. Ultimately, however, it’s just a move back to the oldest form of identity politics,” she continued. “One in which the protection of whiteness and wealth trumps everything. But as some gay Trump supporters might be starting to realize, the right aren’t your friends, and eventually they’ll come for you.”  LGBT conservatives and libertarians have been frequently harassed since President Trump’s election.  In July, OUT Magazine encouraged its readers to “drop” gay conservative friends in an article titled, “What To Do When Your Friend’s a Gay Republican.”  In February, LGBT writer Skylar Baker-Jordan also attacked gay conservatives in an article for the Independent, where he claimed he would refuse to accept gay people who “come out” as supporters of President Trump, while in June, Slate likened LGBT conservatives to “villains.”  Earlier this month, during National Coming Out Day, LGBT conservatives revealed their stories on the difficulty of coming out as conservative to the LGBT community.  “I came out as a conservative gay man in 2012 and was ostracized by my community, rejected by friends and am routinely bullied by LGBT,” declared author and journalist Chad Felix Greene, who has previously written for the Huffington Post.

862,2326,10,20,2017,2017-10-20,Associated Press News,Top Dems nix White House demands to alter health care deal,"Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., second from right, is surrounded by reporters as she heads to vote on budget amendments, Thursday, Oct. 19, 2017, in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Top Senate Democrats rejected White House demands Friday to add provisions weakening the Obama health care law to a bipartisan deal on steadying unsettled insurance markets. The compromise already faced an uphill path and this was the latest blow.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the Trump administration was involved in the negotiations that produced the accord and “should support it instead of floating other ideas that would further the sabotage both parties are trying to reverse.”  Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, lead Democratic author of the agreement, said, “I’m certainly not interested in changing our bipartisan agreement to move health care in the wrong direction.”  The two Democrats were reacting to a White House official who said the measure must provide language lifting the tax penalties President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act imposes on people who don’t buy coverage and employers who don’t offer plans to employees. The White House also wants provisions making it easier for people to buy low-premium policies with less coverage, said the official, who was not authorized to describe the demands on the record.  Such language would be a clear deal-breaker for Democrats, who’ve helped defeat repeated GOP efforts this year to scuttle Obama’s 2010 statute, one of his crowning achievements.  Murray reached agreement last week with Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., for a two-year extension of federal payments to insurers that President Donald Trump has blocked. The measure would also give states modest new flexibility to let insurers sidestep some coverage requirements under Obama’s law.  Failure to restore the money is already leading many insurers to boost premiums and is threatening to chase others out of unprofitable markets around the country.  Obama’s statute requires carriers to lower out-of-pocket costs for poorer customers and the government to reimburse them. A federal judge has found the payments weren’t properly approved by Congress, but Obama and Trump continued them until Trump halted them last week.  Trump’s position on the bipartisan deal has confounded Democrats and Republicans alike. He’s alternately praised and condemned the effort, even as Alexander has said that in four conversations in recent days, Trump has encouraged him to pursue a deal with Democrats.  The Alexander-Murray package would likely garner 60 votes in the Senate, mostly from Democrats, enough for it to survive a filibuster aimed at killing it.  But its fate has been clouded because of Trump’s qualms and opposition from House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and conservatives in that chamber and outside Congress.  In a written statement Friday, Alexander called the back-and-forth “the normal legislative process with people of different views saying what they are for and against.”  Asked Thursday about Marc Short, the White House legislative liaison who’s criticized the bipartisan measure, Alexander said: “I think I’ve talked to the president more about this than he has. And if he wants to carry out the president’s wishes, he’ll be encouraging me to succeed with this.”  ___  AP reporter Ken Thomas contributed.",2.8333333333333335,3,"[3.0, 0.5, 5.0]"
434,1779,10,9,2017,2017-10-09,Fox News,"Nobel goes to Richard Thaler, who made economics human again","People make poor economic choices. They don't save enough for retirement. They refuse to cut their losses on plummeting investments. They buy houses and stocks when prices are high, thinking that what's going up today will keep going up tomorrow.  Richard Thaler of the University of Chicago on Monday won the 2017 Nobel prize in economics for documenting the way people fail to conform to models that assume they always act in their own self-interest. As one of the founders of behavioral economics, Thaler, 72, has helped change the way economists look at the world.  ""Thrilling news,"" said Thaler's frequent collaborator, Cass Sunstein of Harvard Law School. ""He changed economics, and he changed the world.""  Far from being the rational decision-makers described in economic theory, Thaler found, people often make decisions that run counter to their best interests. And their actions carry far-reaching economic consequences: Baby boomers failed to save enough for old age. Americans kept buying homes as prices soared above levels that made any economic sense in the mid-2000s, creating a bubble that led to a devastating financial crisis and recession.  To contain the damage from such collective actions, behavioral economists say, policymakers must recognize human irrationality.  ""I try to teach people to make fewer mistakes,"" Thaler said in an interview Monday with The Associated Press. ""But in designing economic policies, we need to take full account of the fact that people are busy, they're absent-minded, they're lazy and that we should try to make things as easy for them as possible.""  Thaler's work is grounded in day-to-day reality and is connected to popular culture in a way that isn't always true of Nobel-winning economists.  ""He's made economics more human,"" said Peter Gardenfors, a member of the prize committee.  Thaler provided a cameo alongside pop star Selena Gomez in the film ""The Big Short."" He once analyzed the flawed strategies of participants in the game show ""Deal or No Deal."" He's assessed how taxi drivers decide to spend their days and how school cafeterias should display their food.  Thaler won the 9-million-kronor ($1.1-million) prize for ""understanding the psychology of economics,"" Swedish Academy of Sciences secretary Goran Hansson said Monday. He is the 13th Nobel-winning economist from the University of Chicago.  Oddly, the University of Chicago is closely associated with the classical economic views that Thaler has spent much of his career challenging.  ""There's nothing people like better at the University of Chicago than a good argument,"" Thaler said.  In fact, Thaler is the golfing buddy of an intellectual rival, Eugene Fama, the classical Chicago economist who won the Nobel in 2013 for arguing that financial markets are rational.  Asked by phone at a news conference what he planned to do with the prize money, Thaler joked that he intended to spend it ""as irrationally as possible.""  Speaking with the AP later, he offered a fuller response that drew on the philosophy of his work.  ""In traditional economic theory, it's a silly question. And the reason is that money doesn't come with labels. So once that money is in my bank, how do I know whether that fancy bottle of wine I'm buying (is being paid for by) Nobel money or some other kind of money? The serious answer to the question is that I plan to spend some of it on having fun and give the rest away to the neediest causes I can find.""  People's irrational classification of different pools of money is, in fact, fundamental to Thaler's research. He has found that the tendency to assign money to certain categories can lead to costly mistakes. For example, consumers might spend more than they need to when they put, say, a new washing machine on a high-cost credit card because they don't want to tap money they've labeled as savings.  In one study, Thaler and his colleagues studied how taxi drivers try to balance making money versus enjoying their leisure time. The driver might respond by setting a goal: Once his take from fares reaches a certain amount, he calls it a day. But that would mean that he works shorter hours when demand for taxis is high and longer ones when business is slow. If he took another approach, he could make more money working fewer hours. And there would be more cabs in the street when customers need them.  Thaler and other behavioral economists also found that people hold notions of fairness that confound classical economic expectations. They resent, for example, an umbrella peddler who raises prices in the midst of a downpour. Traditional economists would say the peddler is just responding to increased demand.  Thaler says that kind of thinking can keep people from buying things they'd enjoy. A supporter of baseball's Chicago Cubs, Thaler suspects that some of his fellow fans will balk at paying higher-than-usual prices this week to see their team play the Washington Nationals in the playoffs. (He says he secured tickets for Tuesday's game ""at a very reasonable price."")  But consumers' strong feelings about fairness pose a threat to companies, too. They should think hard before raising prices aggressively — even when it's seemingly justified by surging demand — or risk alienating their customers.  ""Uber has learned this lesson or is in the process of learning it,"" Thaler says. ""When they surge-price during a blizzard in New York, that's not a smart business decision.""  Thaler's research carries implications for economic policy. In their 2008 ""Nudge"" book, Thaler and Sunstein suggested that policymakers should find ways to coax, rather than coerce, proper decisions.  Suppose a cafeteria staff realized that students choose food based on the order in which it is presented. It would make sense, Thaler argues, for the school to put the healthiest food where kids would be most likely to grab it. Some critics call such policies manipulative. But Thaler argues that the food has to be displayed somehow; why not choose the one that promotes good health?  Thaler says behavioral economics isn't as novel as is normally assumed. Adam Smith, author of the 1776 classic ""The Wealth of Nations,"" dealt with behavioral issues in his time, including the need to control impulses and avoid overconfidence.  But after World War II, Thaler says economics became dominated by mathematical models. And those were easier to use if economists assumed that people always acted rationally. The mathematical approach ""caused some of the people in the profession to take those assumptions more seriously than they should have.""  A series of financial crises, including the dotcom crash of 2000-2001 and the collapse of the American housing market in the mid-2000s, have put a dent in the view that people and markets are rational.  ""Each crisis,"" he says, ""has been good for behavioral economics.""  ___  Heintz reported from Moscow.

142,871,5,26,2017,2017-05-26,Vox,Bitcoin's price keeps breaking records. Here's what's driving its growth.,"Bitcoin reached a record high on Tuesday, climbing above $2,900 for the first time. That’s more than double the price at the beginning of May, and an incredible 500-fold increase over the past five years.  For Americans, the soaring value might seem like a puzzle, since it doesn’t seem like the payment network is any closer to mainstream acceptance here. But experts tell me that the currency’s recent growth is driven by soaring demand in Asia.  “Based on the data we've collected, we think speculation in the primary driver,” said Garrick Hileman, a Bitcoin expert at the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, in an interview in late May. Hileman says that surveys show most users buying and selling bitcoin for speculative purposes rather than to buy things or send cash to other people.  The big question, of course, is why the market suddenly got so optimistic about Bitcoin’s future. One factor is the Japanese government formally recognized the cryptocurrency in April, giving it greater legitimacy in Asia’s richest major economy. There’s been steady growth of international money-transfer services that use Bitcoin to move cash from one country to another.  Bitcoin has also been in the news recently because the authors of ransomware often demand Bitcoin payments from victims. That’s not great for the cryptocurrency’s image, but it might nevertheless be driving demand upward.  If history is any guide, the latest surge in Bitcoin’s price is likely to end in tears for many of the people who are frantically buying up the virtual currency. There have been three previous times when Bitcoin’s value soared like this — once in 2011 and another in 2013. Each boom was followed by a dramatic crash.  Demand for bitcoins has been skyrocketing in Asia  Those early Bitcoin booms were US-centric, but Bitcoin has become more international since 2013. And data suggests that the big boom we’ve seen over the past month has been driven by surging demand in Asia.  The most dramatic illustration of this is the fact that the value of Bitcoin reached a high of 5 million won in South Korea on May 25, the equivalent of about $4,500 and far higher than the US price of around $2,700 at the time. The price of Bitcoin in Japanese yen was been about $300 higher, on average, than the price in US dollars at the time.  This kind of big spread between currencies doesn’t happen in mature currency markets. Traders are supposed to capitalize on the arbitrage opportunity — buying in one market and selling in the other until the price gap goes away.  But Adam White, the head of a Bitcoin exchange called GDAX, said that this hasn’t happened rapidly enough in the fledgling Bitcoin market. Traders who buy bitcoins with dollars and sell them for South Korean won have to find a way to convert the won into dollars. Regulatory and logistical obstacles prevent them from doing that quickly enough to meet surging demand for bitcoins in South Korea.  The spread between bitcoin’s value in dollars and in its value in yen and won has narrowed in the last two weeks. Still, there continues to be intense interest in the virtual currency in Japan and South Korea.  Hileman points to Japan’s formal recognition of Bitcoin as a significant factor behind this boom. Bitcoin has long enjoyed de facto recognition from governments around the world. But the Japanese legislature went a step further and passed rules specifically spelling out how Japanese financial regulations would apply to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  That will prompt Japanese businesses to give the technology another look, giving it a further sense of momentum.  Bitcoin money-transfer services are starting to catch on  One of the most obvious applications for Bitcoin is in international money transfers. Conventional money transfer networks like Western Union and MoneyGram are slow and expensive. A variety of startups have been building competitors based on Bitcoin.  One example is Bluepan, a South Korean company that helps migrant workers in Japan and South Korea send funds back to their families in the Philippines and China. Bluepan says it has processed $65 million in payments over the past two years, and data provided by the company show a five-fold increase in both the number and value of transactions over the past 18 months.  Of course, $65 million is still a tiny share of the global market for international money transfers. But people are betting that lower fees and faster transactions will allow companies like Bluepan to expand their market share over time.  “Remittance companies are experiencing month-over-month growth of 10 to 20 percent,” says Chris Burniske, a Bitcoin analyst at ARK Invest. “They provide a better service for cheaper.”  Here too, most of the action is happening in Asia, as this chart, taken from a report by Garrick Hileman, shows:  The authors surveyed 48 companies providing services based on cryptocurrencies (predominantly Bitcoin). The chart shows the fraction of these companies’ customers in each region of the world for various types of Bitcoin businesses. Asia dominates the money transfer business and is well represented in other types of Bitcoin businesses.  Interestingly, North America represents a small fraction of the customers in all categories, and money transfer services have hardly any North American customers at all. A big reason for this may be that the global financial system is largely based on the US dollar, making transfers between dollars and other currencies cheaper and easier than sending money between two non-dollar currencies. That leaves less room for Bitcoin-based services to undercut conventional money transfer services in the United States.  Ransomware is giving Bitcoin an unwelcome high profile  Another factor that may be driving interest in Bitcoin is the proliferation of ransomware. That’s malicious software that scrambles all the data on a victim’s computer and then demands a payment to unscramble it. Ransomware authors like Bitcoin because the network doesn’t have an owner who can reverse ransomware payments or help authorities track down their recipients.  “I've seen varying estimates of how much money has been fleeced from ransomees,” Hileman tells me. Some people think that victims have paid hundreds of millions of dollars, he says, but it’s hard to collect accurate data about an underground criminal activity.  Bitcoin fans don’t like to talk about the networks’ illicit uses, which also include ordering illegal drugs on underground websites. And it seems likely that it would be had for Bitcoin’s long-term reputation if it became known primarily as a medium of exchange for extortion and drug dealing.  At the same time, there’s little doubt that media coverage of recent ransomware attacks has raised Bitcoin’s profile, which may have inspired some people to learn about the currency and consider buying some for themselves.  No one knows how much bitcoins should be worth  All of these applications contribute to the overall demand for Bitcoin, but Hileman emphasizes that recent price increases are driven by speculation, not practical uses of the currency. A growing number of people are becoming convinced that Bitcoin’s price is going to go up in the long run. And this has become self-fulfilling prophesy.  They aren’t necessarily wrong. The value of all bitcoins in existence is about $45 billion, a relatively small sum in a world where people have tens of trillions of dollars invested in stocks, bonds, gold, and other assets. If bitcoin becomes a de facto global standard for transferring money across borders, that could justify optimists’ hopes.  Another possibility is that Bitcoin will simply become a popular store of value much like gold. People use gold for jewelry and electronics, of course, but mostly gold is used as a way to store wealth outside the reach of conventional financial institutions. Bitcoin has a much shorter track record than gold, but it has some advantages too: It’s easier to store and can be transferred around the world with the click of a button. The world’s gold supply is worth trillions of dollars.  It’s also possible that the latest price rise is a mere speculative bubble. People might simply be buying bitcoin with an expectation that they’d be able to sell it at a higher price. For a while, that can push prices higher and higher. But eventually the process runs out of steam and starts to go into reverse, causing a panic.  That’s what happened in the spring of 2011, when Bitcoin’s price went from less than $1 to more than $30 in a matter of weeks, only to fall below $3 in October. There were two more bubbles like this in 2013 — one in April and the other in November. Each was followed by a crash.  On the other hand, in each case the currency eventually recovered and went on to set new records. Maybe they weren’t really bubbles after all.  Either way, it’s clear that Bitcoin is one of the riskiest investments anyone can make. If you buy it at today’s historically high prices, you could easily lose most of your investment in a matter of weeks.",2.25,2,"[1.5, 3.0]"

They devote their professional lives to rescuing patients having heart attacks and bringing them back from the brink.  End-of-life care is not typically their focus; neither do they spend much time pondering what some of their patients may experience in the future. “Those who go into cardiology are not necessarily ones who want to deal with death and dying,” Dr. Bristow said.  The very nature of end-stage heart failure makes it all the more difficult to prepare.  “Very few patients understand the trajectory of the disease,” said Dr. Lynne Warner Stevenson, a heart failure specialist at Vanderbilt University. The path has peaks and valleys, but as the patient declines, each peak is a little lower than the one before.  And often doctors do not tell patients what to expect.  “Unfortunately, when you have patients with a chronic illness like heart failure, everyone thinks someone else will talk about it,” Dr. Stevenson said. “Too often, no one takes ownership of the last stage of the journey with the patient.”  Dr. Ellen Hummel of the University of Michigan, one of a small number of doctors specializing in cardiology palliative care, said the typical patient with cancer will usually experience a “fairly predictable” decline.  “They will be less able to take care of themselves,” she said. “They will be more symptomatic and come back to the hospital more frequently.

440,1787,9,27,2017,2017-09-27,Vox,"The Jones Act, the obscure 1920 shipping regulation strangling Puerto Rico, explained","The island of Puerto Rico is devastated, with millions lacking power, infrastructure destroyed, homes damaged, and an entire year’s worth of agricultural output essentially ruined. Like any disaster-struck place, it will be in need of supplies brought it from elsewhere in the country.  But getting goods from the US mainland to Puerto Rico is much more expensive than sending them to Texas or even to other Caribbean islands as a result of a century-old man-made disaster that’s been crippling the island’s economy for a long time.  Meet the Jones Act, an obscure 1920 regulation that requires that goods shipped from one American port to another be transported on a ship that is American-built, American-owned, and crewed by US citizens or permanent residents.  For most Americans, this isn’t a big deal — it enriches a small number of American shipowners while introducing some weird distortions into the overall pattern of economic activity in the United States.  For the residents of the island of Puerto Rico, though, the Jones Act is huge. Basic shipments of goods from the island to the US mainland, and vice versa, must be conducted via expensive protected ships rather than exposing them to global competition. That makes everything Puerto Ricans buy unnecessarily expensive relative to goods purchased on either the US mainland or other Caribbean islands, and drives up the cost of living on the island overall.  A temporary waiver the Trump administration granted under pressure after the hurricane struck has expired with no apparent continuation on the agenda.  NEWS: The Jones Act waiver just expired for Puerto Rico and DHS isn't renewing it. https://t.co/kMy5Tb83fu — Jennifer Bendery (@jbendery) October 9, 2017  But a short-term waiver doesn’t address the law’s real damage to the island. Puerto Rico faces a staggering array of long-term economic challenges beyond the hurricane, and the Jones Act serves as a major impediment to addressing any of them. If it can’t be simply repealed altogether, exempting Puerto Rico from the law would be an easy way for Congress to boost the island’s fortunes at no cost to the average American.  The Jones Act is a 97-year-old law protecting American shipbuilding  The Jones Act is the shorthand name for the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, whose primary author was Sen. Wesley Jones of Washington. (It’s not to be confused with the Jones-Shafroth Act of 1917, which is also critically important to Puerto Rican history but which was sponsored by Rep. William Atkinson Jones of Virginia and relates to the legal status of the island.)  The goal of the legislation was to ensure the existence of a thriving US-owned commercial shipping industry, a topic that had become salient during World War I, when blockades underscored the close link between maritime commerce and warfare.  One section of the law requires goods transported by ship from one US destination to another to be carried on US-flagged ships that were constructed in the United States, owned by US citizens, and crewed by US legal permanent residents and citizens. The idea, basically, is that in case of war there should always be a big supply of American-made, American-owned, American-crewed ships that could be counted on (and, if necessary, conscripted) to supply American commerce even in hazardous conditions.  One could certainly imagine an alternative universe in which the law was a smashing success. Protectionism for US merchant shipbuilding and US-owned and US-crewed merchant ships could have nurtured an infant industry and turned the United States into a globally competitive maritime powerhouse.  That’s not what happened. Instead, global oceanic shipbuilding is dominated by Asian countries, with China, South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, and Taiwan dwarfing American production. US output of merchant ships is even fairly tiny compared to combined European production. According to Daniel Pearson of the Cato Institute, US merchant vessels carry about 2 percent of the world’s cargo, far down from the 25 percent they carried 60 years ago.  Rather than nurturing the creation of a global shipping powerhouse, protectionism for US shipbuilders has allowed the industry to survive despite being laughably uncompetitive in global terms. In most cases, that works out okay in practice because the United States has one of the world’s most robust networks of freight rail. The problem is that when disaster strikes, it would often be useful to mobilize boats quickly. And of course you can’t ship anything by train to Puerto Rico.  The Jones Act is often waived in a disaster  The Jones Act survives because it prevents a handful of US shipbuilding and merchant shipping operations from going out of business, and nobody else with political clout really cares.  But the executive branch has the authority to waive the act in special circumstances, as it has done in the past whenever the downside of making it excessively expensive to ship American goods from one place in America to another becomes a high-profile issue.  The Bush administration issued Jones Act waivers after Hurricanes Katrina and Hurricane to speed the shipment of fuel to the Gulf Coast.  The Obama administration issued a more limited waiver after Hurricane Sandy, again to speed the shipment of fuel.  On September 8, the Trump administration issued Jones Act waivers for areas impacted by Hurricane Harvey.  As Keith Hennessey, formerly the top economic adviser to President Bush, recounted in a 2010 blog post, the politics of Jones Act waivers are difficult. Emergency waivers in rare periods of spiking demand don’t put anyone out of business, but they still do have a long-term cost for the industry. If American-owned ships could count on windfall profits derived from price gouging arising every time a hurricane causes acute fuel shortages in a coastal location, that would support the creation of a slightly larger stock of domestic boats.  When considering the Katrina waivers, Hennessey recounts, “the pushback was not just from maritime unions, but also from the U.S.-flagged shipping industry, including shippers and shipbuilders, and including Rs and Ds on Capitol Hill who were close to the industry.”  At the end of the day, “without a strong lean from President Bush on his Cabinet to ‘do everything we can,’ the waivers would not have happened,” given the intensity of the political pushback.  Of course, one advantage that residents of Louisiana, Texas, and New Jersey have had in seeking Jones Act waivers is that they are represented in Congress by senators and House members. These congressional representatives wouldn’t ordinarily pick a big fight with shipbuilding and maritime union interests, but in the moment of a crisis, they certainly can and do.  Puerto Rico, however, lacks congressional representation, which is surely a factor in why the Trump administration initially refused to offer a waiver, even though they’d done Harvey/Irma waivers just a few weeks earlier.  Trump on why he won’t waive the Jones Act: “A lot of people who are in the shipping industry don’t want” it lifted. https://t.co/OLVpupUfja — Rebecca Ballhaus (@rebeccaballhaus) September 27, 2017  But another issue is that the specific application of the Jones Act to Puerto Rico actually is a really big deal economically even when a hurricane doesn’t strike.  The Jones Act is a big deal for Puerto Rico  The result of all of this is that in Puerto Rico — where incomes are much lower on average than in the mainland US — the cost of living is far higher than it needs to be.  According to John Frittelli’s 2014 analysis for the Congressional Research Service, it costs about twice as much to operate a ship complying with the Jones Act as a typical ship used for international cargo. Drewry Maritime Research concluded in 2013 that US-built, Jones-compliant vessels cost about four times as much to build as comparable foreign ships.  More expensive ships that are more expensive to operate add up to a situation in which Jones-compliant shipping is much more expensive than non-Jones shipping.  “The cost of shipping a standard-size container from New York to Puerto Rico has been much higher than shipping it to Jamaica,” writes North Carolina State University economics professor Thomas Grennes. “Similarly, the cost of shipping from Los Angeles to Hawaii has been higher than the cost of shipping the same product from Los Angeles to Shanghai.”  An absence of domestic port-to-port shipping is an occasional distortion for the US mainland, but it’s a systemic economic impediment for places like Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico, in particular, is so close to the United States that the most cost-effective way to transport many goods there would be for ships to stop off en route to a mainland port. But under the Jones Act, foreign-originating goods must be dropped off in Jacksonville and then shipped to Puerto Rico via an exorbitantly expensive Jones-compliant vessel. Likewise, it costs far more to ship US-produced goods to Puerto Rico than it does to Jamaica.  This raises the cost of living on Puerto Rico, makes Puerto Rico an unattractive place to produce goods bound for the US mainland, and has the bizarre effect of putting Puerto Rico at a competitive disadvantage to other Caribbean islands as a destination for American tourists.  In the US Virgin Islands, which are exempt from the law, US-made goods are about half as expensive, while the cost of living in Puerto Rico is 13 percent higher than on the American mainland. Food on Puerto Rico costs twice as much as it does in Florida, and that’s before the devastation of the island’s agriculture by Hurricane Maria.  There are a few policy options for relief  In the short term, the Trump administration should issue a broad temporary waiver of the Jones Act so that supplies could more easily reach Puerto Rico from the American mainland. While the American people will likely be generous with their charitable contributions of both money and supplies, it’s fairly perverse to have a healthy chunk of that generosity soaked up by monopolist shipowners rather than going to the actual delivery of food and medicine to people in need.  But the Jones Act relief shouldn’t stop there.  Unlike Houston, Puerto Rico isn’t a thriving place that happens to have been hit by a serious natural disaster. It’s a poor place by American standards whose economy has been in shambles for about a decade and whose bankrupt government is now hamstrung by its creditors. It badly needs an overall improvement in economic conditions — some kind of prospect for long-term growth — and permanently lifting the Jones Act is one of the more powerful levers at federal disposal for doing that. Reducing the cost of living on the island will make it a more attractive destination for tourism and retirees, while giving the island at least some shot of developing export industries and raising living standards for residents.  This could, of course, be achieved by simply repealing the Jones Act, as Sen. John McCain has proposed several times, most recently in July.  If that’s too much for the shipbuilding industry to swallow, a narrow law exempting Puerto Rico from its reach could be a helpful idea. Alternatively, a midsize law that would narrow the Jones Act to the contiguous 48 states might pick up the congressional delegations of Alaska and Hawaii as champions while lifting Puerto Rico incidentally.  But the risk for the island is that while the immediate devastation of Hurricane Maria is leading to a brief surge in attention, the subject of maritime regulation will likely soon slip back into its customary obscurity — dragging down Puerto Rico’s economy more out of indifference than malice.",3.375,4,"[0.5, 4.0, 5.0, 4.0]"

170,990,5,31,2017,2017-05-31,Vox,Critics say Trump’s cellphone diplomacy is dangerous. Experts aren't so sure.,"The Associated Press reported today that Donald Trump has been giving his cellphone number to the leaders of allied countries like Canada, Mexico, and France and telling them to call him directly.  The Associated Press took a scolding tone, suggesting that the president is endangering national security by having sensitive conversations over a mobile device. Former Pentagon adviser Derek Chollet ominously told the AP: “If you are speaking on an open line, then it’s an open line, meaning those who have the ability to monitor those conversations are doing so.”  But is talking to foreign leaders on a cellphone really such a security risk? Experts from Rice University and Security Research Labs told me it wasn’t so obvious.  The security of a smartphone depends on how it’s configured and how it’s used. And while Trump himself is hardly a security expert, the US government employs some of the world’s most sophisticated security professionals. And they have likely taken elaborate precautions to maximize the security of the president’s wireless communications.  We don’t know exactly what security precautions might have been taken, but one clue comes from a recent reports that Trump has swapped his ancient Android phone for an iPhone. According to Axios’s Mike Allen, Trump’s new iPhone has just one third-party app: Twitter.  It’s probably an updated version of the locked-down iPhone President Obama described last year. In an interview with Jimmy Fallon, the former president complained about the phone’s limited functionality.  “I imagine they locked down the phone in a variety of ways beyond removing apps,” says Dan Wallach, a security expert at Rice University, by email.  An obvious change, Wallach says, would be to replace the default phone app — which makes calls over the insecure conventional cell phone network — with an app that routes phone calls through an encrypted link to NSA headquarters in Fort Meade, MD.  “That's a pretty good solution,” says Karsten Nohl, a security expert at Security Research Labs who has done groundbreaking research on the security of cellular networks. Indeed, he says, making calls using an encrypted smartphone app could be “as safe as what you'd be using from a landline phone in the White House.”  Of course, no communications system is perfect. Nohl says one big issue is that different countries have developed their own proprietary encrypted networks for internal communications. These systems aren’t compatible with each other, so when world leaders call each other, they’re sometimes forced to use unencrypted lines. But Nohl says countries face this challenge whether their leaders are making calls with a cellphone or a landline phone.  It’s also possible that despite the National Security Agency’s precautions, foreign governments could hack into Trump’s cellphone itself. But in that case, it wouldn’t matter that much whether Trump took calls on his cellphone or via a nearby landline — so long as the smartphone was in the room, the hackers would be able to hear every word Trump said.  Indeed, it’s likely that when Trump makes calls using his cellphone, the biggest security threats come from things other than his own cellphone. For example, we can assume foreign intelligence agencies are trying to hack the personal cellphones of Trump’s aides, family members, and others who spend time with the president. They may also try to plant listening devices in locations — like Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort — where Trump might have sensitive conversations. This is why presidents normally have sensitive conversations in Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities — essentially high-tech tents that ensure no listening devices are within earshot.  But there doesn’t seem to be anything inherently insecure about a president taking calls from foreign leaders on a cellphone that has been suitably locked down by US intelligence agencies. Modern cryptography is extremely robust, and it allows cellphones to make calls that are essentially impervious to eavesdropping.",2.8,5,"[1.0, 4.0, 5.0, 3.5, 0.5]"

Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., also a member of the committee, after they reviewed transcripts of interviews with top Comey aides who alluded to the email’s existence. The Senate Judiciary Committee is investigating Comey in his role as FBI director and President Trump’s decision to fire him in May.  The senators penned a letter on Aug. 30 to newly-appointed FBI Director Christopher Wray noting their findings, saying that “it appears that in April or early May of 2016, Mr. Comey had already decided he would issue a statement exonerating Secretary Clinton. That was long before FBI agents finished their work,” the letter said. “The outcome of an investigation should not be prejudged while FBI agents are still hard at work trying to gather the facts.”  Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate in 2016, was investigated by the FBI for using a private email address and server to handle classified information while serving as secretary of state.  In July 2016, Comey famously called Clinton’s email arrangement “extremely careless” though he decided against recommending criminal charges.  The existence of such an email draft raised questions about Comey’s Senate testimony in June 2017 regarding his decision to go public with findings in the Clinton email investigation.  At the time, Comey testified that he was inclined to publicly announce the results of the probe to “protect the credibility of the investigation,” after then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton had an unscheduled meeting on a tarmac in Arizona.

The report, which assessed 17 top global tech companies in three areas, also faulted many of them for failing to use more recycled materials in their products and slow progress in phasing out use of toxic materials.  “Tech companies claim to be at the forefront of innovation, but their supply chains are stuck in the Industrial Age,” Gary Cook, a campaigner at Greenpeace USA, said in a statement.  The report details the hidden cost behind what may be the most sought-after and celebrated consumer products in the 21st century: mobile computing devices like smartphones and tablet computers.  Since 2011, Greenpeace has urged global tech companies to transition to renewable energy, prompting some of them to switch to environmentally friendly power sources for their data centers. The group is urging the industry to tackle energy issues in manufacturing and supply chains, design longer-lasting products to reduce electronics waste and urging an overall rethink of its “take-make-waste” business model.  The report highlighted that tech companies’ manufacturing processes are not as environmentally friendly as their innovative images might suggest.  While the energy consumption in the tech industry rose rapidly to fuel the supply chains and the manufacturing of these products as well as the data centers where social media, cloud computing and other applications run, so have the greenhouse gas emissions.  Samsung Electronics received a grade of D in its use of renewable energy, which accounted for just 1 percent of its manufacturing process, compared with Apple, which relied on renewable energy for 96 percent of its operation. Samsung, the world’s largest maker of smartphones and key component suppliers of many of the tech companies featured in the report, saw its greenhouse gas emissions rise 24 percent in 2016 from two years ago. It also received low marks on its efforts to reduce and disclose hazardous chemicals at workplaces and to design long-lasting products.  Samsung Electronics and other companies mentioned in the report did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.  Chinese smartphone makers Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo have gained a significant share of the market in the last few years. They scored below average in all categories and lacked transparency and commitment in renewable energy, the report said.  Amazon was the only U.S. company that received the lowest mark, an F, in its overall environmental performance, along with the Chinese phone makers. Greenpeace said Amazon was among the least transparent companies and did not report the greenhouse gas footprint of its own operations.  Among the 17 companies, Amsterdam-based Fairphone and Apple were said to be doing better in various areas.  Greenpeace urged the companies to use more renewable energy, switching energy sources that power their supply chains. It also urged the tech companies to remove hazardous chemicals and other materials from their products and workplaces and design longer-lasting devices to help reduce waste.  If the tech industry does not change to renewable energy, the world won’t be able to tackle climate change, said Greenpeace campaigner Lee Insung.  “In the next three to five years, the use of renewable energy and how well the companies cope with climate change will determine their core competitiveness,” Lee said.  ___  The report: www.greenpeace.org/greenerguide",2.764705882352941,17,"[3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0, 0.5, 3.5, 2.5, 0.5, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 0.5, 2.5, 2.5, 0.5, 2.5]"
438,1784,10,10,2017,2017-10-10,Fox News,FBI cites black extremists as new domestic terrorist threat,"The 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., has spawned a violent domestic threat from “black identity extremists” who have stepped up attacks on police, according to an explosive new report by the FBI’s counterterrorism division.  The warning, first reported by Foreign Policy magazine, says that “it is very likely BIEs proactively target police and openly identify and justify their actions with social-political agendas commensurate with their perceived injustices against African Americans ...”  Brown, an African-American 18-year-old, was shot in August 2014 after struggling with white police officer Darren Wilson. Although Brown's supporters claimed it was a deadly case of police brutality, Wilson was cleared of wrongdoing and resigned in November 2014.  Police officials said that Wilson stopped Brown after getting a call about a robbery at a convenience store in which the clerk was strong-armed after the suspect – with whom Brown was a match -- attempted to leave.  Wilson and Brown got into a scuffle as Brown reportedly reached for the police officer’s gun, and Wilson then gave chase, shooting him. Brown's family said he had his hands up when he was shot, police said it was untrue.  The shooting led to protests in Ferguson that then spread to other parts of the country. It gained added momentum after subsequent racially charged police shootings, spurred on via social media and the group Black Lives Matter.  The FBI report said that the agency previously had analyzed the potential for violence of black identity extremism, a term that was unfamiliar before it appeared in the document. What has changed, according to the report, is that violence has now actually occurred and is 'likely"" to continue.    “It is very likely that BIEs’ perceptions of unjust treatment of African-Americans and the perceived unchallenged illegitimate actions of law enforcement will inspire premeditated attacks against law enforcement over the next year,” the report said. “It is very likely additional controversial police shootings of African-Americans and the associated legal proceedings will continue to serve as drivers for violence against law enforcement.”  Attacks in which police officers are targeted have been on the rise in recent years. The most high-profile such incident occurred last year in Dallas, when a gunman named Micah Johnson hid in a parking garage and fired on 11 police officers, killing five of them, during a protest against officer-involved shootings. The FBI report noted that Johnson referred to anger over police shootings and toward whites as what drove him to kill the five police officers.  The FBI report drew accusations of racial profiling.  DeRay Mckesson of Black Lives Matter told The Guardian the terrorism report echoes the days when the FBI tracked activist groups including the NAACP and those that opposed wars.  “We knew that we were likely being watched,” said Mckesson, a longtime critic of government monitoriing of protest groups. “This is confirmation that the work of social justice continues to threaten those in power.”  The Guardian also quoted an unnamed source it described only as a former senior official from the Department of Homeland Security saying that the category ""black identity extremist"" was troubling.  ""This is a new umbrella designation that has no basis,"" the source is quoted as saying. ""There are civil rights and privacy issues all over this.""  But others say that the FBI is correctly sounding an alarm about a serious trend.  ""It's not racial profiling, it's violence profiling,"" Scott Walter, president of Capital Research Center, a conservative think tank, told Fox News. ""Identity politics can kill, whether it's white identity politics, which killed in Charlottesville, or black identity politics, which kills cops.""  ""We have to be able to distinguish between free speech and violence,"" Walter said. ""[Many] longtime [black] activist groups were not obsessed with violence.""    Randy Sutton, a former Las Vegas law enforcement official who now is the national spokesman for Blue Lives Matter, told Fox News that the FBI report makes official what he and others in police work have been observing in recent years.  ""Nobody is saying anything negative about protests,"" Sutton said, ""Protesting is everyone's right. This is about commiting acts of violence. Many Black Lives Matter protests call for violence against police, with chants like 'What do we want?' and 'Dead cops!' It's terrorism, and it's no different than Islamic terrorism.""  Sutton said the rising number of ambush attacks on police has had a chilling effect on how they do their jobs.  ""Police are not being as aggressive because of the political climate,"" he said. ""There's been a dramatic decrease in proactive policing.""",2.227272727272727,11,"[2.5, 0.5, 0.5, 5.0, 1.5, 4.0, 4.0, 0.5, 0.5, 5.0, 0.5]"

The Federal Emergency Management Agency said Oct. 27, it had no involvement in the decision to award a $300 million contract to help restore Puerto Rico's power grid to a tiny Montana company in Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke’s hometown. FEMA said in a statement that any language in the controversial contract saying the agency approved of the deal with Whitefish Energy Holdings is inaccurate. (AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa, File)  SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — The head of Puerto Rico’s power company said Sunday the agency is cancelling its $300 million contract with Whitefish Energy Holdings amid scrutiny of the tiny Montana company’s role in restoring the island’s power system.  The announcement by Ricardo Ramos came hours after Gov. Ricardo Rossello urged the utility to scrap the deal for Whitefish’s help in rebuilding the electrical system from the damage inflicted by Hurricane Maria.  “It’s an enormous distraction,” Ramos said of the controversy over the contract. “This was negatively impacting the work we’re already doing.”  The current work by Whitefish teams will not be affected by the cancellation and that work will be completed in November, Ramos said. He said the cancellation will delay pending work by 10 to 12 weeks if no alternatives are found.  Ramos said he had not talked with Whitefish executives about his announcement. “A lawsuit could be forthcoming,” he warned.  Whitefish spokesman Chris Chiames told The Associated Press that the company was “very disappointed” in the governor’s decision, and said it would only delay efforts to restore power.  He said Whitefish brought 350 workers to Puerto Rico in less than a month and it expected to have a total of 500 this week. Chiames said the company completed critical work, including a project that will soon lead to a half million people in San Juan getting power.  “We will certainly finish any work that (the power company) wants us to complete and stand by our commitments,” he said.  Roughly 70 percent of the U.S. territory remains without power more than a month after Maria struck on Sept. 20 as a Category 4 storm with winds of up to 154 mph (245 kph). Ramos said Sunday that the total of cost of restoring the system would come to $1.2 billion.  The cancellation is not official until approved by the utility’s board. Ramos said it would take effect 30 days after that.  Ramos said the company already has paid Whitefish $10.9 million to bring its workers and heavy equipment to Puerto Rico and has a $9.8 million payment pending for work done so far.  Ramos said cancellation of the contract will not lead to a penalty, but it’s likely the government will pay at least $11 million for the company to go home early, including all costs incurred in the month after the cancellation.  Federal investigators have been looking into the contract awarded to the small company from Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke’s hometown and the deal is being audited at the local and federal level.  Ramos said the company contacted Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority two days before the storm hit, at a time when it was becoming clear the hurricane could cause massive damage.  Ramos earlier said he had spoken with at least five other companies that demanded rates similar to those of Whitefish, but also wanted a down payment the agency did not have.  He said Sunday he hadn’t consulted with anyone else about signing the deal and didn’t notify the governor’s office for a week. He again praised Whitefish’s work.  “They’re doing an excellent job,” he said.  “There’s nothing illegal here ... Of that, we’re sure,” he said, adding that he welcomes a federal investigation. “The process was done according to the law.”  Ramos said his agency at first believed the Federal Emergency Management Agency pre-approved contracts, something the agency has denied.  FEMA said it has not approved any reimbursement requests from the power company for money to cover repairs to the island’s electrical system. The contract said the utility would not pay costs unallowable under FEMA grants, but it also said, “The federal government is not a party to this contract.”  FEMA has raised concerns about how Whitefish got the deal and whether the contracted prices were reasonable. The 2-year-old company had just two full-time employees when the storm hit, but it has since hired more than 300 workers.  The White House had no comment Sunday. Last week, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the federal government had no role in the process that led to awarding the contract.  “This was something solely determined by the Puerto Rican government,” she said Friday.  Rossello said he has requested that crews from New York and Florida come help restore power in Puerto Rico as he criticized the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for not meeting its goals. The agency could not be immediately reached for comment.  The governor also announced the appointment of an outside coordinator to oversee the power company’s purchase and contracting division.  “If something illegal was done, once again, the officials involved in that process will feel the full weight of the law, and I will take administrative actions,” Rossello said.  A Whitefish contract obtained by The Associated Press found that the deal included $20,277 an hour for a heavy lift Chinook helicopter, $650 an hour for a large crane truck, $322 an hour for a foreman of a power line crew, $319 an hour for a journeyman lineman and $286 an hour for a mechanic. Each worker also gets a daily allowance of $80 for food, $332 for a hotel room and $1,000 for each flight to or from the mainland.  The company is based in Whitefish, Montana. Zinke, a former Montana congressman, knows Whitefish CEO Andy Techmanski, and Zinke’s son also had a summer job at a Whitefish construction site.  “I had absolutely nothing to do with Whitefish Energy receiving a contract in Puerto Rico,” Zinke recently said in a statement linked to a tweet. “Any attempts by the dishonest media or political operatives to tie me to awarding or influencing any contract involving Whitefish are completely baseless.”  Democrats also have questioned the role of HBC Investments, a key financial backer of Whitefish. The Dallas-based company’s founder and general partner, Joe Colonnetta, has contributed thousands of dollars to President Donald Trump and other Republicans. Chiames, the Whitefish spokesman, has said that Colonnetta’s political donations were “irrelevant” and that the company would cooperate with any federal authorities.  This week, Rep. Rob Bishop, the Utah Republican who heads the House Natural Resources Committee, sent the power company director a letter demanding documents, including those related to the contract with Whitefish and others that show what authority the agency has to deviate from normal contracting processes.  “Transparent accountability at (the power company) is necessary for an effective and sustained recovery in Puerto Rico,” his office said in a statement.  A federal control board that oversees Puerto Rico’s finances announced this week that retired Air Force Col. Noel Zamot will be in charge of power reconstruction efforts. Rossello and other officials have rejected the appointment, saying the local government is in charge of a power company that is $9 billion in debt and had struggled with outages before hurricanes Irma and Maria last month.",3.6818181818181817,110,"[3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 2.5, 1.5, 4.0, 3.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 5.0, 3.0, 3.5, 4.5, 2.0, 5.0, 5.0, 3.5, 5.0, 2.5, 3.5, 3.0, 2.0, 5.0, 0.5, 4.0, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.0, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 0.5, 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 3.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 1.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 2.5, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 3.0, 2.5, 4.0, 4.5, 2.5, 2.5, 2.0, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 2.5, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 2.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.0, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5, 2.5, 0.5, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 3.0, 3.5]"
567,1961,10,13,2017,2017-10-13,Fox News,Storms surge and US retail sales surge; most in 2 ½ years,"Americans increased their spending at retailers last month by the most in two and a half years, driven by strong auto sales as residents of hurricane-ravaged areas replaced destroyed cars.  Retail sales rose 1.6 percent in September, after slipping 0.1 percent in August, the Commerce Department said Friday.  Auto sales jumped 3.6 percent, the most since March 2015. Gas sales climbed 5.8 percent, the most in four and a half years, reflecting price spikes after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The storms damaged oil refineries and pushed up gas prices 13 percent last month.  Even excluding the volatile auto and gas categories, sales rose a solid 0.5 percent, up from a 0.1 percent gain in August.  Neil Saunders, managing director of Global DataRetail, said that many analysts worried higher gas prices would lead Americans to spend less elsewhere.  ""This did not materialize, and consumers used modest gains in wages ... to carry on buying,"" Saunders said.  Americans are optimistic about the economic outlook. A measure of consumer sentiment released Friday by the University of Michigan rose to its highest level since 2004. The U.S. unemployment rate has hit a 16-year low, and wages have ticked up in recent months. That should boost spending and broader economic growth in the coming months.  Most of the gains last month were likely fueled by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which slammed into Texas, Florida and other southeastern states in late August and September.  Sales at home and garden supply stores rose 2.1 percent, probably lifted by hurricane preparation, as well as repairs and renovations in the aftermath of the storms. Grocery store sales increased 0.8 percent, the most since April 2016, likely boosted by restocking after the hurricanes hit.  Sales at general merchandise stores, which include big box retailers such as Walmart and Target, rose 0.3 percent.  Online retailers reported another healthy gain of 0.5 percent. E-commerce sales have jumped 9.2 percent in the past year, more than double the overall sales increase of 4.4 percent.  Not all stores saw a boost: Sales at furnishers, electronics and appliance stores, and sporting goods stores fell.  The retail sales report is closely watched because it provides an early read on consumer activity each month. Consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of the economy.  U.S. economic growth likely slowed in the July-September quarter as the hurricanes shut down thousands of businesses, people were forced to miss work, and power was cut to millions of homes. Analysts forecast that the economy expanded at a 2 percent annual pace in the third quarter, down from a 3 percent gain in the April-June quarter.  Yet the economy is expected to rebound in the final three months of the year as rebuilding and repair work accelerates.

Benen also questioned whether Trump would take ownership of such a market correction in the same way he has tried to take credit for the recent expansion (emphasis original):  1. The stock market is not a presidential report card. Though Trump administration officials have explicitly argued otherwise, to see the markets as a barometer of economic health is a mistake. Sometimes the markets go up during tough economic times, sometimes they go down during good economic times. 2. Live by Wall Street, die by Wall Street. Will Trump World continue to see the markets as the only metric that matters if there’s a correction? Somehow, I doubt it. 3. Obama. Under Trump’s predecessor, the markets nearly tripled in value. If Wall Street performance is a measure of a president’s economic successes, Trump must see Barack Obama as a legendary genius. 4. We still remember Trump’s pre-election rhetoric.

Roosters like taking credit for the sunrise, but that doesn’t make it so. Yes, the markets have steadily gained this year, just as they’ve steadily gained in recent years.

The index of 30 large publicly traded companies is a popular proxy for the health of America’s largest businesses. If the Dow were crashing, it would be a real sign of trouble. But economists have frequently found little relationship between returns on stock investments and real economic growth. For example, a major 2002 study, from three economists, looked at equity returns and per capita gross domestic product growth for 16 nations from 1900 to 2000 and found little evidence that stronger equity returns correlated with stronger long-run economic growth.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)  WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House is still trying to decide who will get President Donald Trump’s pledged $1 million donation for Harvey storm relief efforts, one of the largest gifts ever given by a president but one that has evoked his checkered charitable past.  The president plans to make the donation, which is expected to come from his personal fortune, early next week, and it may be split among several groups doing relief work in storm-ravaged areas of Texas and Louisiana. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Friday that the president hasn’t finalized where the money will go, raising some concern that charitable groups may end up competing for the money.  For the second straight day, Sanders invited reporters to make recommendations for which groups should get the money.  “If you have suggestions, he is very open to hearing those,” Sanders said.  The president met with three relief groups — the Red Cross, Southern Baptist Relief and Salvation Army — in the Oval Office on Friday and pledged the nation’s support to those affected by Harvey.  “Families have given food and shelter to those in need. Houses of worship have organized efforts to clean up communities and repair damaged homes,” Trump said during an earlier meeting with religious leaders. “People have never seen anything quite like this. Individuals of every background are striving for the same goal: to aid and comfort people facing devastating losses.”  Trump traveled to Texas on Tuesday and is scheduled to return Saturday to meet with storm survivors and inspect some of the destruction.  There has been some concern that, if Trump opted to donate to only one group or just a few, there could be intense competition among relief agencies for the money and the publicity that comes with it.  But Rick Cohen, communications director for the National Council of Nonprofits, said there’s already intense competition among organizations for Harvey donations.  “He should be looking to make an informed contribution, and it seems that he’s doing so,” said Cohen, noting that the president has stayed abreast of conditions on the ground and is planning to see it first-hand.  White House officials said the donation would come from the president’s personal fortune and not his business, the Trump Organization, or his charitable foundation.  “You have to take him at his word,” said Leslie Lenkowsky, a professor at Indiana University who focuses on philanthropy and who formerly headed the Corporation for National and Community Service. “If he wants to lead the way, that’s one of the things that a president’s supposed to do. ... He does like the image of himself as a compassionate person.”  Trump’s history of charitable donations features bursts of generosity frequently overshadowed by failed promises and questions about the source of the gifts.  The president has claimed to be worth $10 billion while experts have pegged his fortunate at far less. But Trump reportedly donates a far smaller percentage of his dollars than many of his fellow billionaires. The exact extent of Trump’s charitable giving is not known since the president has broken with decades of tradition and not released his tax returns.  The Trump Foundation came under heavy scrutiny during the 2016 presidential campaign. It was revealed that Trump frequently did not follow through on his charitable promises. Records show that in the 15 years before his campaign, Trump made $8.5 million in pledges but paid out about $2.8 million, according to The Washington Post.  In January 2016, Trump held a high-profile fundraiser for veterans’ causes, but it took him four months — and pressure from the media — to follow through on his pledge to donate $1 million of his own money to the cause.  Trump, one of the nation’s wealthiest presidents, has also pledged to donate his annual $400,000 salary to charity. His first two gifts from his presidential earnings were to the National Park Service and the Education Department.  Other presidents, including Barack Obama, would customarily donate a percentage of their income — including money from outside sources like book sales — to charity every year.  ___  Lemire reported from New York.",3.5,1,[3.5]
574,1969,10,14,2017,2017-10-14,Fox News,Steve Bannon recruiting rabble-rousers to take on GOP establishment,"When Steve Bannon left the Trump administration in August, he said he could do more to shake up Washington from outside the White House than from inside.  Now, it looks as if Bannon's plan is coming together.  Bannon has been recruiting and promoting challengers to GOP incumbents and the party's preferred candidates in next year's midterm elections.  It's an insurgency that could give Washington the jolt it needs to end years of stagnation and gridlock -- and get the U.S. moving again.  But it could also imperil Republican majorities in the House and Senate.  The emerging Bannon class of rabble-rousers share limited ideological ties but have a common intent to upend Washington and knock out Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., standard-bearer of the establishment.  It's a crop of candidates that unnerves a GOP that lost seats -- and a shot at the Senate majority -- in 2010 and 2012 with political novices and controversial nominees and fears a stinging repeat in 2018.  ""The main thing that binds them together is a rejection of the Republican Party establishment, a rejection of the political elites, the financial elites and the media elites,"" said Andy Surabian, a former Bannon aide and senior adviser to the pro-Trump PAC Great America Alliance.  ""The main thing that binds them together is a rejection of the Republican Party establishment, a rejection of the political elites, the financial elites and the media elites."" — Andy Surabian, senior adviser to the Great America Alliance, a pro-Trump political action committee  Bannon helped elevate twice-suspended Judge Roy Moore, who won an Alabama runoff over McConnell's pick, Sen. Luther Strange.  Moore was removed from office for refusing to remove a Ten Commandments monument from Alabama's judicial building and then suspended for insisting probate judges refuse same-sex couples marriage licenses.  Moore faces Democrat Doug Jones in a December election where polls show a single-digit lead for the Republican, a remarkable development in Attorney General Jeff Sessions' heavily GOP state.  ""We don't have leadership. We have followership,"" Moore said Friday at the Values Voter Summit where he argued for scrapping the health care law with no replacement.  In West Virginia, the grassroots conservative group Tea Party Express endorsed Patrick Morrissey, also a Great America Alliance choice, over establishment favorite Rep. Evan Jenkins in a competitive race to unseat Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin.  Senate Republicans had been upbeat about adding to their 52-48 majority, especially with Democrats defending more seats in 2018, including 10 in states Trump won in last year's presidential election. But the Bannon challenge could cost them, leaving incumbents on the losing end in primaries or GOP candidates roughed up for the general election.  Consider Mississippi, where state Sen. Chris McDaniel lost to veteran Sen. Thad Cochran in 2014, but is weighing a bid next year against Roger Wicker, the state's other senator in the national legislature.  McDaniel misdefined ""mamacita,"" the Spanish word for mommy as ""hot mama,"" and said he would withhold his tax payments if the government paid reparations for slavery. He also was forced to denounce a supporter who photographed and posted an image of Cochran's bed-ridden wife.  He argued in court that his 2014 loss was due in part to African Americans fraudulently voting in the primary. He's back again and speaking in Bannon terms.  ""They will do anything, they will say anything, to just maintain a hold on power,"" McDaniel said in an Associated Press interview about McConnell and his allies.  He's already envisioning the theme of a challenge against Wicker.  ""On one side, a liberty-minded, constitutional conservative. On the other side, Wicker and McConnell,"" he said.  In Arizona, former state Sen. Kelli Ward, who is challenging Trump antagonist Sen. Jeff Flake, remains known for entertaining the debunked theory that jet aircraft are used to intentionally affect the weather or poison people.  In 2015, she gave conflicting answers about her beliefs after holding a public hearing she said was to answer constituents' questions. But John McCain used it to marginalize her in his winning GOP Senate primary against her, and McConnell reprised it in August in a web ad which referred to her as ""chemtrail Kelli.""  Former New York Rep. Michael Grimm, who spent eight months in prison for federal tax evasion, is challenging two-term Rep. Dan Donovan -- with the encouragement of Bannon.  In announcing his candidacy, Grimm was apologetic for his conviction. Still out there are viral videos of him famously telling a television reporter during an on-camera interview at the U.S. Capitol after a question he didn't like: ""You ever do that to me again, I'll throw you off this (expletive) balcony.""  House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., is sticking with the incumbent: ""I support Dan Donovan, plain and simple,"" Ryan said this week.  But he stopped short of suggesting Bannon stand down. ""It's a free country,"" he said.  In Nevada, Bannon is encouraging Republican Danny Tarkanian in his challenge to GOP Sen. Dean Heller. Tarkanian, son of famed basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian, is zero-for-five in state and federal elections.  These outsiders share strong opposition to increasing the nation's debt even if it means an economy-rattling default and unsparing criticism of congressional Republicans, especially McConnell, for failing to dismantle the Obama-era health care law, an unfulfilled seven-year-old promise.  In Wyoming, Erik Prince, founder of security contractor Blackwater, is considering a Republican primary challenge to Sen. John Barrasso, a senior member of the Senate GOP leadership team. Bannon has urged Prince, brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, to run.  Bannon has given at least one Senate incumbent -- Texas Sen. Ted Cruz -- a pass, but others are in his cross-hairs.  ""Nobody's safe. We're coming after all of them,"" Bannon said during a Fox News interview Wednesday. ""And we're going to win.""  The Associated Press contributed to this story.",4.25,2,"[5.0, 3.5]"
1076,2654,10,27,2017,2017-10-27,Associated Press News,"5 years after Superstorm Sandy, the lessons haven’t sunk in","Water from New York Harbor surrounds the southern tip of New York's Manhattan borough on Tuesday, Oct. 17, 2017, seen from aboard a Staten Island Ferry. Superstorm Sandy roared ashore five years ago, Monday, Oct. 29, 2012, devastating the coastlines of New Jersey, New York and parts of Connecticut and becoming one of the costliest storms in U.S. history. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig)  Five years after Superstorm Sandy was supposed to have taught the U.S. a lesson about the dangers of living along the coast, disaster planning experts say there is no place in America truly prepared for climate change and the tempests it could bring.  That is true even in New York and New Jersey, where cities and towns got slammed by deadly floodwaters that rose out of the Atlantic on the evening of Oct. 29, 2012.  While billions have been spent to repair the damage, protecting vulnerable infrastructure, people and property across the nation from the more extreme weather that climate change could bring is going to require investment on a staggering scale, easily costing hundreds of billions, perhaps trillions.  Some coastal protection projects are moving forward, but the most ambitious ideas spurred by Sandy’s onslaught are still in the design stage, with questions about whether they will ever be built.  Some wonder whether the nation has the will to undertake such ventures, even after this past season brought more catastrophic storms, including Hurricane Harvey, which swamped Houston, and Hurricane Maria, which laid waste to Puerto Rico’s electrical grid.  It's been five years since Superstorm Sandy inflicted billions of dollars in damage in New York and New Jersey, but many wonder if the region is any more prepared for extreme weather now than it was before Sandy. (Oct. 27)  “It felt after Sandy as if we might have finally had our wake-up call. We’d start to take these things seriously,” said Eric Klinenberg, director of the Institute for Public Knowledge, a think tank at New York University. “We’d make the kind of investment in climate security that we made in homeland security after Sept. 11. But of course nothing of the sort has happened.”  Some experts worry also that the ascendance of a climate-change skeptic to the White House may put the brakes on coastal protection efforts. In August, President Donald Trump rescinded President Barack Obama’s post-Sandy order requiring future sea level rise to be factored into federally funded infrastructure projects.  “Since the new administration is not using the CC word, the climate change word, it’s very hard to instill this forward-looking kind of attitude where you have to take into account sea level rise and how the flood zones expand,” says Klaus Jacob, a Columbia University scientist specializing in climate change adaptation.  And yet, some planners still hope that Sandy created momentum for projects that could serve as national models.  ___  BIG IDEAS  After Sandy, which was blamed for at least 182 deaths in the U.S. and Caribbean and more than $71 billion in damage in this country alone, a government-funded competition called Rebuild by Design produced audacious ideas for defending the coast.  One concept, dubbed The Big U, would create 10 miles (16 kilometers) of floodwalls, berms and gates around lower Manhattan. Other ideas include erecting breakwaters around Staten Island that would double as oyster beds, and reconfiguring the Meadowlands, the polluted wetlands of urban New Jersey, with berms and marshes.  The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development put up $1 billion to get those projects started, but construction hasn’t begun on any of them.  Amy Chester, Rebuild By Design’s executive director, said it will take years to complete all the planning and gain government approvals and community support. And it’s not clear how much these projects will ultimately cost.  ___  ONE CITY’S PLAN  LaTrenda Ross gets teary-eyed recalling the days after Sandy flooded the streets of Hoboken, New Jersey, a city of 50,000 people across the Hudson River from Manhattan that has been her home for 40 years.  “To not be able to go to work, to sit there in the dark, no elevators, no way out, was devastating,” she said. If something isn’t done to prevent a repeat, “there won’t even be a city of Hoboken. We might as well pack up and move now.”  New Jersey does, in fact, have a plan. Over the summer it hired an engineering firm to carry out one of the Rebuild by Design concepts: an anti-flood system for Hoboken. The $230 million project, funded by HUD, involves a series of floodwalls, pumping stations and water retention tanks.  Construction is due to start in 2019 and take at least three years.  Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer said the cost is worth it. Eighty percent of the city flooded during Sandy, she said, causing as much as $1 billion in damage. Buildings were ruined. Three of the city’s four fire stations flooded. A vital commuter train station was knocked out for months.  Laura Baird, an engineer who helped develop the plan, said had the system been in place when Sandy hit, 85 percent of the city would have been protected.  ___  PROGRESS AND DOUBT  While the grandest ideas about post-Sandy protections are still far from reality, there has been progress .  Communities on the New Jersey shore built sand dunes to hold back surf, or fortified existing ones. Power companies and New York’s subway system have put flood protections around key infrastructure. Hospitals moved electrical equipment out of basements.  The Army Corps of Engineers is scheduled to begin construction in 2019 on a 5-mile-long (8-kilometer-long), 20-foot-high (6-meter-high) seawall and promenade that would run along New York’s Staten Island in front of the neighborhoods hit hardest by Sandy. The project, which is still being designed, has an estimated price tag of $600 million and is scheduled for completion by 2022.  Michael Cappannari, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said the administration is committed to helping communities recognize the risk and defend against flooding. He cited several federally funded projects underway, including construction of boardwalks with seawalls hidden beneath them and flood-proofing of sewage treatment systems.  It’s not enough, said Jacob, the Columbia scientist.  “It’s on a pace that’s dictated by the funds that are available, politically made available,” he said. “And if that snail’s pace continues, there’s a good chance that we may have another severe storm in town or in the region that will outpace that slow pace of improving the systems.”  Politicians locally and in Congress appear reluctant to get behind enormously expensive and sometimes divisive projects to deal with a threat that often feels hypothetical.  In Hoboken, for example, one proposal for a floodwall that would have protected more of the city was rejected because it would have blocked river views. Cities throughout the country have been reluctant to curtail building on the waterfront, because those spots are in such great demand from homebuyers.  In New York City, FEMA redrew the flood maps after Sandy, nearly doubling to 71,500 the number of buildings deemed to be in high-risk zones. The city objected for fear that would raise flood insurance rates and stifle waterfront development, and last year FEMA agreed to roll the flood zones back.  Bill Golden, president of the National Institute for Coastal and Harbor Infrastructure, said worrying about spending too much is shortsighted, and he blames the inaction on “a misunderstanding of the new reality that we face.”  A study released Monday by an international team of scientists predicted that between 2030 and 2045, New York City could experience storm surges of over 7.4 feet (2.25 meters) every five years, primarily because of sea level rise. That’s up from every 25 years in recent decades.  ___  NO RETREAT  After Sandy, New York and New Jersey bought and emptied 1,250 homes in areas it deemed too difficult to protect from floods.  Patty Snyder, whose 53-year-old brother drowned when Sandy struck, was among the Staten Islanders who took a buyout. “I knew I was never going back, because I felt the city, state and federal governments never were going to do what needed to be done to stop future flooding,” she said.  But most people in the wrecked communities did return, whether because they were skeptical of the risk, confident about the planned Staten Island seawall, or simply unwilling to say goodbye to their homes.  Some homes were rebuilt on elevated foundations or pilings. Others were restored to the way they were before Sandy, leaving them just as vulnerable.  “I really don’t think it will happen again,” said Fred Steinfeld, a Staten Island resident whose basement filled with water during Sandy. “I just think that storms like that don’t happen that often.”  Dexter Dugan, whose Staten Island home got 9 feet of water, took steps to make it more storm-resistant, including putting heating and electrical systems on the second floor.  “You live near the water, it’s going to flood,” he said.  ___  For complete coverage of the five-year anniversary of Superstorm Sandy, go to https://www.apnews.com/tag/SuperstormSandy  ___  This story has been corrected to show that the damage is more than $71 billion, not $65 billion.",2.9310344827586206,29,"[4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 2.5, 2.5, 4.5, 4.0, 2.0, 5.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.5, 1.5, 2.5, 4.5, 2.5, 4.0, 2.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.5, 4.5, 0.5, 4.0, 5.0, 1.5, 5.0, 3.5, 2.5]"

Floodwaters have inundated at least five highly contaminated toxic waste sites near Houston, raising concerns that the pollution there might spread. (AP Photo/Jason Dearen)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Sunday he expects the Environmental Protection Agency “to get on top” of the threat of possible water contamination after an Associated Press report of highly toxic waste sites flooded in the Houston area.  “The EPA is monitoring that. The EPA is going to get on top of that,” said Abbott, when asked on “Fox News Sunday” whether toxic floodwaters could pose a continuing health threat to Texas residents.  “We are working with the EPA to make sure that we contain any of these chemicals harming anybody in the greater Houston area or any other place,” he said.  The Houston metropolitan area is home to more than a dozen Superfund sites, designated by the EPA as being among America’s most intensely contaminated places. The AP surveyed seven of them and reported Saturday that all had been inundated with water, in some cases many feet deep, raising the concern that floodwaters may wash in pollution.  An EPA statement later confirmed the AP’s reporting that the federal agency had not yet been able to physically visit the Houston-area sites, saying the sites had “not been accessible by response personnel.” EPA staff had checked on two Superfund sites in Corpus Christi on Thursday and found no significant damage.  On Sunday, Abbott said there will always be a threat of contaminated water whenever there is a flood situation.  “What people need to do is they just need to be very cautious in the way they respond,” he said. “Do things like wear gloves, wear a mask, wear clothing so that your skin is not going to brush up against what you’re cleaning.”  Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said he was comfortable with the safety of Houston’s drinking water, saying the Superfund sites were outside the city.  “Certainly, we would hope that the EPA would be on the ground now to take a look at those Superfund sites, to make sure that contamination is contained and limited,” he said.  Abbott appeared on Fox and CNN’s “State of the Union,” while Turner spoke on NBC’s “Meet the Press” and CBS’ “Face the Nation.”",4.5,1,[4.5]
467,1826,10,10,2017,2017-10-10,Breitbart,Obama Administration Used Confidential Taxpayer Information to Push Obamacare,"Judicial Watch uncovered yet another Obama IRS scandal – and one that includes the massive Health and Human Services (HHS) running Obamacare AND the Obama White House directly!  We received two productions of documents, 77 pages and 108 pages, from the IRS revealing that the Obama IRS coordinated with the Department of Health and Human Services and the Obama White House Behavioral Sciences “Team” in a $5 million program to pressure Americans to sign up for Obamacare.  The documents also contain inter-agency agreements between the IRS and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) devised to circumvent potential legal prohibitions on unauthorized disclosure or inspection of taxpayer information collected by the IRS.  The documents were produced in Judicial Watch Inc. v. Internal Revenue Service and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (No. 1:17-cv-00615). They were produced under court order in our April 2017 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit against the IRS and HHS, which we filed after the agencies failed to respond to November 2016 FOIA requests for:  All records concerning IRS efforts to reach out to individuals who either claimed an exemption or paid a penalty for failing to purchase mandatory health insurance under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Such records include, but are not limited to, communications, policies, and procedures pursuant to such efforts;  Samples of any letters, notices or other materials prepared and/or sent to taxpayers encouraging the purchase of mandatory health insurance; and  Any records regarding cooperation between IRS and the Department of Health and Human Services or any other government entity, whether state or federal, regarding efforts to reach out to individuals who have not purchased mandatory health insurance. Such records, include, but are not limited to, communications, agreements, memoranda of understanding, and any other inter-agency communications. Of special interest are any such records regarding the sharing of protected taxpayer information.  In September 2016, IRS Director of Individual Taxation Janet McCubbin writes to several of her colleagues:  Attached are drafts of the letters that IRS will send to selected taxpayers who paid a penalty for failure to have coverage or who claimed an exemption form the coverage requirement for tax year 2015 … As you know, we are planning to send several different versions of the letter to see which types of messages work best. *** These letters have been drafted with input from the White House Behavioral Sciences Team and CMS, and have been approved by CMS. And IRS staff provided a lot of assistance on the PDF.  The White House Behavioral Sciences Team was established in 2015 by an Obama Executive Order directing federal agencies to adopt research about how people make decisions into policy development.  The documents show that the agencies spent at least $5 million to develop the letters ($4,820,702.83 and $179,297.17).  The documents released by Judicial Watch include letters targeting people who legally refused to sign up for Obamacare and elected to pay the penalty or individuals who claimed an exemption. The letter written to people who claimed an exemption states:  Why am I getting this letter? The law requires people to have a minimum level of health coverage, qualify for an exemption, or pay a penalty when they file their taxes. Our records show you claimed an exemption from the health coverage requirement when you filed your 2015 taxes. If you or someone in your family doesn’t have health insurance or an exemption next year, you’ll likely owe a penalty for 2017. We are writing to make sure you know how you can avoid this penalty by signing up for health insurance or getting an exemption.  A document labeled “a privacy/legal question” seems to indicate the Obama administration was concerned its target letter might violate the law (26 U.S. Code § 7431 and 26 U.S. Code § 6103) protecting the confidentiality of taxpayer return information:  Inspection or disclosure by employee of United States If any officer or employee of the United States knowingly, or by reason of negligence, inspects or discloses any return or return information with respect to a taxpayer in violation of any provision of section 6103, such taxpayer may bring a civil action for damages against the United States in a district court of the United States.  Under the Obamacare laws, HHS is authorized only to send a simple notification of options:  Secretary of the Treasury, acting Through the Internal Revenue Service and in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall send a notification to each individual who files an individual income tax return and who is not enrolled in minimum essential coverage …  HHS may have overstepped its authority by threatening people with penalty fees.  How much will my penalty be next year if I don’t sign up? The penalty for not having any health-coverage or an exemption in 2017 will be at least $695 per adult and $347 per child (up to $2,085 per family), and could be more, depending on your income.  Also, the “best-case” cost estimate for Obamacare is misleading because it neglects to mention the cost of deductibles and co-payments.  How much does health insurance at HealthCare.gov cost? Most people who enroll in a plan through HealthCare.gov can find plans for $75 a month or less after financial help.  These documents are part of five promised document productions from the IRS. We will surely have more documents well into next year.  But we have enough evidence now of more Obama IRS abuses targeting innocent Americans – all in the name of Obamacare. No wonder it took a federal lawsuit and court order to get these documents—as they show the Obama White House and its agencies were happy to threaten and treat Americans like lab rats in order to bolster Obamacare.",4.75,2,"[5.0, 4.5]"

1595,3303,11,11,2017,2017-11-11,Associated Press News,Will Alabama pick a Democrat over Moore? Suburbs will decide,"Former Alabama Chief Justice and U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore speaks at the Vestavia Hills Public library, Saturday, Nov. 11, 2017, in Birmingham, Ala. According to a Thursday, Nov. 9 Washington Post story an Alabama woman said Moore made inappropriate advances and had sexual contact with her when she was 14. Moore has denied the allegations. (AP Photo/Brynn Anderson)  ALABASTER, Ala. (AP) — It’s no secret that if Roy Moore is going to lose his race for U.S. Senate, it’s going to happen in Alabama’s suburbs. And on Friday, a day after allegations emerged that the outspoken Christian conservative had sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl decades ago, at least a few Republicans in one Birmingham suburb were having second thoughts about their party’s nominee.  “Really and truly, I cannot tell you what I’m going to do right now,” said Carolyn Griffin, of Calera, as she watched her dog Loxy exercise at Alabaster’s Veterans Park.  Griffin is the kind of voter who might be moved by the allegations, and suburban Shelby County is where other likeminded voters are located. While Alabama might be called the Heart of Dixie, much of Shelby County is Anysuburb USA, with subdivisions and strip malls sprawling ever farther south along traffic-choked highways leading out of Birmingham.  The accusations against Moore come as Democrats are feeling increasingly optimistic about their strength in suburbs after Tuesday’s elections in Virginia, New Jersey and other races. Still, it’s a steep, steep climb in Alabama. No Democrat has held a U.S. Senate seat there since 1997, when Howell Heflin retired.  Moore has been considered the strong favorite as a Republican running in a deeply red state, and polls taken before the Washington Post story showed him with a lead over Democratic challenger Doug Jones in the Dec. 12 race.  But Moore, a polarizing figure within his own state, has typically underperformed other Republicans in general-election races, giving rise to Democrats’ hope of a victory against him in the off-year election.  “There was a universe in Alabama that was uncomfortable with him, all while Republicans were gaining in Alabama,” Birmingham-based Democratic pollster John Anzalone said. “These allegations now give these voters a reason to vote against him or stay home.”  The 70-year-old Moore, a former state Supreme Court judge, was twice removed from the Alabama Supreme Court, once for disobeying a federal court order to remove a 5,200-pound (2,359-kilogram) granite Ten Commandments monument from the lobby of the state judicial building and later for urging state probate judges to defy the U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized gay marriage.  He has vehemently denied accusations that he had sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl and pursued three other teenagers when he was an assistant district attorney in his early 30s.  He repeated his denial Saturday while speaking to the Mid Alabama Republican Club in Vestavia Hills outside Birmingham.  “There are investigations going on. In the next few days, there will be revelations about the motivations and the content of this article that will be brought to the public,” Moore said without elaborating. “We fully expect the people of Alabama to see through this charade.”  David Mowery, an Alabama-based political campaign consultant who helped run a Democrat’s unsuccessful campaign against Moore in 2012, said the allegations against Moore are damaging but aren’t necessarily a death blow.  “I think it hurts. It hurts because they are having to divert time and effort and probably money into killing it,” Mowery said. “Can they turn the page, so to speak, and turn it back to a D versus R thing?”  “There’s an old saying that the only way some candidates could lose is to be caught with a dead girl or a live boy. Alabama is going to test the specs on that like ‘Hold my beer,’” Mowery said.  The state’s eight most populous counties have almost as many people as the other 59 combined, and those are among the areas where Moore was weakest in the primary against Sen. Luther Strange, appointed to the Senate on an interim basis after Jeff Sessions was elevated to U.S. attorney general.  Former state Republican Party chairman Marty Connors said he expected the impact of the allegations to be concentrated in the suburbs.  “It will affect what I call your really, really moderate Republican voters,” Connors said.  But not everyone in the suburbs is ready to abandon Moore. Frank Pimintel of Alabaster said he viewed the allegations as part of a typical political smear campaign and wouldn’t judge Moore for something that happened more than 30 years ago.  “I’m about states’ rights, low taxes, local control. He stands for a lot of things that I believe in,” Pimintel said.  That’s more along the lines of the reaction that Connors and retired University of Alabama political science professor Bill Stewart expect rural voters to have.  “In rural Alabama, they don’t seem to be putting a lot of stock in this story,” Stewart said. “They don’t believe it.”  Connors said the accusations could even energize supporters, similar to how President Donald Trump survived audio of him bragging about groping women.  Mark Victory of Alabaster counted himself as still “tentatively in the Moore camp” after the claims.  Victory said he wants to support Trump’s agenda but might be swayed by more proof. If there is more proof, he said, his reaction would be to not vote at all.  “I’m not going to vote for his opponent,” Victory said, saying he believes Jones is too submissive to the agenda of national Democratic leaders.  But moderate Republicans not voting might not be enough for Jones, Stewart said, “given the intensity of Republican identification in Alabama.” Stewart still thinks Moore’s going to win, despite the allegations.  “I don’t think it matters enough to make Jones the favorite to win,” he said.  ___  Beaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.

Shares meandered Tuesday in Asia after markets retreated from their record highs overnight and China reported weak manufacturing data. (AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko)  TOKYO (AP) — Global shares were mixed Tuesday, with European benchmarks marking gains in early trading after a lackluster session in Asia.  KEEPING SCORE: The CAC 40 of France edged up less than 0.1 percent to 5,495.72 while Britain’s FTSE 100 added 0.4 percent to 7,510.77. Germany’s markets were closed for a public holiday. Dow futures gained 0.1 percent to 23,317.00 and S&P 500 futures were up 0.2 percent to 2,572.10, pointing to an upbeat start to Halloween on Wall Street.  CENTRAL BANK WATCH: The Bank of England is set to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade on Thursday to help keep a lid on inflation. That could hurt the British economy while it is struggling with the uncertainties of Brexit. Meanwhile, investors expect President Donald Trump to announce his choice to next head the U.S. Federal Reserve within days, a decision that could have far-ranging effects on the markets. The Fed is due to start a two-day meeting on Tuesday. It’s expected to raise rates at its next meeting in December, which would be the third increase of the year.  BANK OF JAPAN: The Bank of Japan wrapped up a policy meeting Tuesday with no changes to its ultra-lax stimulus program. It slightly raised its forecast for growth in this fiscal year but cut its outlook for inflation to 0.8 percent from an earlier forecast of 1.1 percent, saying that while the economy is gaining momentum, growth is not yet pushing wages higher or boosting consumer demand enough to fuel inflation.  EARNINGS: This week will see more than 100 companies in the S&P 500 index report their earnings results for July through September. In Asia, Samsung Electronics Co. reported another record high in quarterly earnings on a breathtaking run for a company that is fighting to get its leader out of jail. The South Korean company’s July-September net income surged 150 percent to 11 trillion won ($9.8 billion), compared with 4.4 trillion won a year earlier.  CHINA MANUFACTURING: An official survey said Chinese manufacturing activity expanded in October at a slower pace than the previous month as output weakened. The purchasing managers’ index released Tuesday fell to 51.6 from 52.4 in September. The index is based on a 100-point index where 50 divides expansion from contraction. The surveys are closely watched leading indicators for China’s economy, the world’s second biggest.  ASIA’S DAY: Japan’s Nikkei 225 index was flat at 22,011.61 while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong lost 0.3 percent to 28,245.54. The Shanghai Composite index regained lost ground to close 0.1 percent higher at 3,393.34. South Korea’s Kospi advanced 0.9 percent to 2,523.43 after Samsung reported record profits. The S&P ASX 200 in Australia slipped 0.2 percent to 5,909.00. Shares in Taiwan rose and markets in Southeast Asia were mixed.

It is a striking declaration, a betrayal of American trust and interests that is almost treasonous in its own right.  On Saturday aboard Air Force One, en route to Hanoi, Vietnam, Trump said of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russia’s assault on our elections:  “He just — every time he sees me, he says, ‘I didn’t do that.’ And I believe — I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it. But he says, ‘I didn’t do that.’ I think he’s very insulted by it, if you want to know the truth.”  Trump went on to call the fact that Russia interfered in our election an “artificial Democratic hit job” that would cause people to die in Syria because Putin’s hurt feelings about being called on his crimes would prevent him from making a deal to end the bloody conflict in that country. And he called former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former C.I.A. Director John O. Brennan and former F.B.I. Director James Comey “political hacks.”",4.25,2,"[3.5, 5.0]"
1225,2823,10,31,2017,2017-10-31,Vox,President Obama wants to give young leaders around the world the tools to organize,"In a speech at his foundation’s “leadership summit” on Tuesday, President Barack Obama didn’t discuss President Donald Trump or the Russia scandal or the Republican attempts to dismantle Obamacare.  Instead, the former president spoke at length about his time as an organizer on the South Side of Chicago — an experience he cited as crucial for informing the two-day summit that just kicked off at the new Obama Foundation. The event attracted some famous attendees, including Prince Harry, artist Theaster Gates, former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, as well as musicians like Gloria Estefan, the band the National, and Chance the Rapper.  Obama explained that more than 500 “rising and established community leaders” were attending the event because the foundation was hoping to learn how it could best help young organizers across both the country and around the world. One of the foundation’s goals is to figure out to how give grassroots organizers and young people the tools to convene meetings or rally around a cause. Obama said the project was partly inspired by the job as a community organizer he’d been given by a group of churches in his 20s.  “They had no money, so all they could afford to do was hire me,” he said of the churches. But Obama explained that early experience in local organizing — fighting for a public park in a drug-infested part of town; taking on an environmental crisis at a public housing project — left a profound impact on him. Obama suggested that in his post-presidency, he wants to give young activists from around the world the capacity to organize that he only barely had on the South Side:  The thing that was most exciting for me was the idea of creating a hub, a venue a place, a network in which all these young people across the globe and across the country ... could start meeting each other, and seeing each other, and teaching each other, and learning from each other. Because if we could create an architecture — a platform — for those young people to thrive, and to grow, and to scale up all the amazing stuff they’re already doing locally, and not to just root themselves locally but to germinate and seed all around the country and all around the world, then there’s no problem we couldn’t solve. Then there’s no aspiration that we might not reach. And so that’s the plan. That’s the vision.  Obama: “Our goal here is not to create a political movement”  But what was as perhaps as interesting as what Obama said is what he didn’t. As former aides to the president have told me, Obama is acutely aware that whatever he says or does will be interpreted as a rebuke of, or commentary on, Donald Trump. That aversion toward overt political action — or even implicit criticism of his successor — carried into his speech on Tuesday.  “Don’t be partisan. Our goal here is not to create a political movement,” Obama told the summit attendees. “I believe firmly in politics, but the moment we’re in right now politics is the tail and not the dog.”  As I’ve previously reported, some critics have noted that Obama’s post-presidential goals appear to be to combine political goals with apolitical means. “We got into the weakest position in decades through Obama’s attempt to live in a post-partisan world that doesn’t exist,” said Charles Chamberlain of Democracy for America. “The president should be doing exactly what everyone else in the Democratic Party should be doing: following the resistance, fighting back against Trump, or getting out of the way.”  Even his speech today referenced the achievements of the civil rights movement, before stressing that the goals of this event were not political. As he has in the past, Obama instead suggested that American politics could not be fixed without first fixing the culture that produced it. “What we need to do is think about our civic culture,” he said.  Obama followed that proclamation up by announcing one ground rule for the summit: Attendees would not be allowed to take selfies. He and Michelle Obama, he added, were interested in having real face-to-face conversations with the event’s participants.  “It sounds trivial,” he added. “But it’s not.”",3.6,20,"[3.5, 4.0, 2.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 2.5, 3.5, 3.0, 4.0, 3.5, 2.5, 0.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5]"

A computer server crucial to a lawsuit against Georgia election officials was quietly wiped clean in July 2017, just after the suit was filed. Data on the server could have indicated whether Georgia elections were manipulated by malicious hackers. (AP Photo/Alex Sanz, File)  A computer server crucial to a lawsuit against Georgia election officials was quietly wiped clean by its custodians just after the suit was filed, The Associated Press has learned.  The server’s data was destroyed July 7 by technicians at the Center for Elections Systems at Kennesaw State University, which runs the state’s election system. The data wipe was revealed in an email sent last week from an assistant state attorney general to plaintiffs in the case that was later obtained by the AP. More emails obtained in a public records request confirmed the wipe.  The lawsuit, filed July 3 by a diverse group of election reform advocates, aims to force Georgia to retire its antiquated and heavily criticized election technology. The server in question, which served as a statewide staging location for key election-related data, made national headlines in June after a security expert disclosed a gaping security hole that wasn’t fixed six months after he reported it to election authorities.  WIPED OUT  It’s not clear who ordered the server’s data irretrievably erased.  The Kennesaw elections center answers to Georgia’s secretary of state, Brian Kemp, a Republican running for governor in 2018 and the suit’s main defendant. His spokeswoman issued a statement Thursday saying his office had neither involvement nor advanced warning of the decision. It blamed “the undeniable ineptitude” at the Kennesaw State elections center.  After declining comment for more than 24 hours, Kennesaw State’s media office issued a statement late Thursday attributing the server wiping to “standard operating procedure.” It did not respond to the AP’s question on who ordered the action.  Plaintiffs in the lawsuit, mostly Georgia voters, want to scrap the state’s 15-year-old vote-management system — particularly its 27,000 AccuVote touchscreen voting machines, hackable devices that don’t use paper ballots or keep hardcopy proof of voter intent. The plaintiffs were counting on an independent security review of the Kennesaw server, which held elections staging data for counties, to demonstrate the system’s unreliability.  Wiping the server “forestalls any forensic investigation at all,” said Richard DeMillo, a Georgia Tech computer scientist following the case. “People who have nothing to hide don’t behave this way.”  STATE SECURITY  The server data could have revealed whether Georgia’s most recent elections were compromised by hackers. The plaintiffs contend results of both last November’s election and a special June 20 congressional runoff— won by Kemp’s predecessor, Karen Handel — cannot be trusted.  Possible Russian interference in U.S. politics, including attempts to penetrate voting systems, has been an acute national preoccupation since the Obama administration sounded the alarm more than a year ago.  Kemp and his GOP allies insist Georgia’s elections system is secure. But Marilyn Marks, executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, a plaintiff, believes server data was erased precisely because the system isn’t secure.  “I don’t think you could find a voting systems expert who would think the deletion of the server data was anything less than insidious and highly suspicious,” she said.  NOW YOU SEE IT, NOW YOU DON’T  It could still be possible to recover relevant information from the server.  The FBI is known to have made an exact data image of the server in March when it investigated the security hole. The Oct. 18 email disclosing the server wipe said the state attorney general’s office was “reaching out to the FBI to determine whether they still have the image” and also disclosed that two backup servers were wiped clean Aug. 9, just as the lawsuit moved to federal court.  On Wednesday, the attorney general’s office notified the court of its intent to subpoena the FBI seeking the image.  Atlanta FBI spokesman Stephen Emmett would not say if that image still exists. Nor would he say whether agents examined it to determine whether the server’s files might have been altered by unauthorized users.  FAILING TO SERVICE THE SERVER  A 180-page collection of Kennesaw State emails, obtained Friday by the Coalition for Good Governments via an open records search, details the destruction of the data on all three servers and a partial and ultimately ineffective effort by Kennesaw State systems engineers to fix the main server’s security hole.  As a result of the failed effort, sensitive data on Georgia’s 6.7 million voters — including Social Security numbers, party affiliation and birthdates — as well as passwords used by county officials to access elections management files remained exposed for months.  The problem was first discovered by Atlanta security researcher Logan Lamb while doing online research in August 2016. He informed the election center’s director at the time, noting in an email “there is a strong possibility your site is already compromised.”  Based on his review of the emails, Lamb believes that electronic polling books could have been altered in Georgia’s biggest counties to add or drop voters or to scramble their data. Malicious hackers could have altered the templates of voting machine memory cards to skew results. An attacker could even have potentially modified “ballot-building” files to corrupt the outcome, said Lamb, who works at Atlanta-based security firm Bastille Networks.  THE BIGGER PICTURE  Though striking, the wayward election server is seen as just part of a much larger problem.  The Department of Homeland Security says 21 states had elections systems scanned or penetrated by Russia-backed hackers last year, though there’s no evidence they altered voting outcomes.  But computer security experts say it’s possible Russians or other malicious actors have sown undetected booby traps in the highly decentralized U.S. voting landscape. In June, a leaked National Security Agency memo showed that 122 elections officials in various states were targeted with phishing emails crafted by Russian agents intent on stealing their passwords.  CALL TO INVESTIGATE  Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr was urged Thursday to investigate. GOP state Rep. Scot Turner: “They should go and look at who did it and why they did it and see ... whether there was criminal intent.” Carr’s office declined comment.  Georgia U.S. Rep Hank Johnson, a Democrat, separately said the server wipe “appears to be a willful and premeditated destruction of evidence” by election officials, adding, “Georgia voters should be as outraged as I am.”  Sara Henderson, executive director of Common Cause Georgia, noted Kemp has repeatedly denied involvement in the university’s decisions on voting machine security.  “Georgia is not creating a climate of voting integrity for our citizens by continuing to blame shift,” Henderson said via email.  ___  Frank Bajak on Twitter: http://twitter.com/fbajak",3.1710526315789473,38,"[3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.5, 1.5, 5.0, 2.5, 2.0, 1.5, 1.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5, 5.0, 2.0, 2.0, 4.0, 2.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.0, 2.0, 1.5, 0.5, 4.0, 2.0, 5.0, 1.0, 0.5, 2.5, 1.0, 4.0, 2.5, 4.5]"

The UN Climate Change Conference 2017 will take place under Presidency of the Government of Fiji in Bonn, Germany and starts on Monday, Nov. 6, 2017. (AP Photo/Martin Meissner, file)  BERLIN (AP) — Governments, scientists, industry groups and environmental campaigners are meeting in Germany next week to discuss implementing a global agreement to curb climate change, despite uncertainty over how the United States will figure into the effort.  President Donald Trump announced earlier this year that the U.S. will pull out of the 2015 Paris climate accord unless his administration can secure a better deal.  Other countries have pledged to press on regardless at the Nov. 6-17 meeting in the western German city of Bonn. The 23rd Conference of the Parties (COP) will be presided over by Fiji, one of the small island nations particularly vulnerable to the effects of global warming.  Researchers say extreme weather like the events of recent months — including hurricanes in the Caribbean, heatwaves in Europe and flooding in south Asia — are going to become more frequent as a result of climate change. To prevent catastrophic consequences, they say countries must make concerted efforts to shift the global economy away from fossil fuels and to adjust to some inevitable impacts, such as rising sea levels.  “This COP is more important than most people realize,” Andrew Steer, head of the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based environmental think tank, said.  Steer said a growing number of commitments from governments, as well as from major companies and cities around the world was “broadly encouraging.” He noted the falling cost of renewable energy — a key technology required to help power-hungry economies kick the carbon habit.  Most of the 195 countries coming to Bonn — where the U.N. climate agency is located — appear willing to continue hammering out the details needed to make the Paris 2015 accord work, German Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks said ahead of the two-week talks.  Negotiators will try to agree on ways to measure each country’s greenhouse gas emissions and to make sure everyone is playing by the same rules. Since the Paris agreement doesn’t foresee sanctions for countries that fail to meet their targets, peer pressure is the main mechanism for ensuring that governments abide by their commitments and continue to increase their efforts in future.  A key issue will be the transparency of emissions reports, said Nigel Purvis, a former U.S. State Department negotiator under the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush presidencies.  The United States used to be the major force pushing for more open reporting and that will suffer because of the Trump administration’s planned withdrawal from Paris, he said.  “Without U.S. leadership the deal is likely to take a little bit longer and may not be as strong,” said Purvis, president of the group Climate Advisers.  Negotiators have until the end of 2018 to come up with the final rule book; it would be subject to approval at the next climate summit in Katowice, Poland.  Observers say that without the United States driving the talks — as it did in Paris when Barack Obama was in the White House — other leaders will have to fill the gap.  “The United States are not anymore the most important actor in this game of climate change,” Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said.  “The most important actor is China, and India will soon become extremely important, as well as the European Union,” Schellnhuber said.  Some are also placing their hopes in Emmanuel Macron. The French president is expected to fly in on Nov. 15 to show his support during the final phase of the talks. Macron has called for a follow-up meeting in Paris next month.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel, a veteran of past climate summits, will also put in an appearance in Bonn despite being tied up in negotiations to form a new government. The Green Party, with which she hopes to forge a coalition, has urged Merkel to set a firm date for Germany to end the use of coal-fired power plants.

While he conceded that there is no way of knowing to what extent the tax cuts stimulated growth, he added: “We’re no longer seen as the high-tax jurisdiction. People feel good about that, which is a psychological factor that I feel is very important.”  Contrast that success with what happened in Kansas, which also carried out a notable tax experiment recently. Under the leadership of Gov. Sam Brownback, the Republican-dominated Legislature passed deep tax cuts that went into effect in 2013, with only modest efforts to raise revenue by broadening the base. The governor called the move “a shot of adrenaline into the heart of the Kansas economy.”  If so, it was a shot that nearly killed the patient. There was no surge in economic growth — Kansas lost jobs in 2015, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported, trailing its neighbors Nebraska and Oklahoma and posting one of the worst performances of any state. In June, faced with a $900 million budget gap, Kansas lawmakers threw in the towel. They passed a $1.2 billion tax increase and overrode Mr. Brownback’s veto.  Tax reform is never easy, and it wasn’t in the District of Columbia, either. There are no Republicans on the council, but as the Republicans have discovered, there can be sharp divisions within the same party. Among elected officials, the main opposition came from Vincent C. Gray, then the mayor, and the most liberal council members, who favored spending increases over tax cuts.  “The counterweight is always to spend the money,” Mr. Mendelson told me this week. “The mayor wanted to spend it, so I had to step up. Other members were willing to stand behind me as long as I was willing to take the political heat.”  The council passed the measure by a vote of 11 to 2. Opponents have fought a rear-guard action to delay putting the measure’s remaining cuts into effect, without success.",2.5,1,[2.5]
432,1777,6,13,2017,2017-06-13,Vox,Persuasive proof that America is full of racist and selfish people,"“Google is a digital truth serum,” Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, author of Everybody Lies, told me in a recent interview. “People tell Google things that they don't tell to possibly anybody else, things they might not tell to family members, friends, anonymous surveys, or doctors.”  Stephens-Davidowitz was working on a PhD in economics at Harvard when he became obsessed with Google Trends, a tool that tracks how frequently searches are made in a given area over a given time period.  He spent five years combing through this data. The idea was that you could get far better real-time information about what people are thinking by looking at Google Trends data than you could through polls or some other survey device.  It turns out he was right.  As a barometer of our national consciousness, Google is as accurate (and predictive) as it gets. In 2016, when the Republican primaries were just beginning, most pundits and pollsters did not believe Trump could win. After all, he had insulted veterans, women, minorities, and countless other constituencies.  But Stephens-Davidowitz saw clues in his Google research that suggested Trump was far more serious than many supposed. Searches containing racist epithets and jokes were spiking across the country during Trump’s primary run, and not merely in the South but in upstate New York, Western Pennsylvania, Eastern Ohio, rural Illinois, West Virginia, and industrial Michigan.  Stephens-Davidowitz saw in the Google Trends data a racially polarized electorate, and one primed to respond to the ethno-nationalist rhetoric of Trump.  There were earlier signs, too. On Obama’s 2008 election night, Stephens-Davidowitz found that “one in every hundred Google searches that included the word ‘Obama’ also included ‘KKK’” or the n-word. Searches for racist websites like Stormfront also spiked.  “There was a darkness and hatred that was hidden from traditional sources,” Stephens-Davidowitz says. “Those searches are hard to reconcile with a society in which racism is a small factor.”  Racial attitudes are just one of the many interesting discoveries in Stephens-Davidowitz’s research. He also explores the disconnect between our social media lives and our actual lives, between what we talk about publicly and what we think about privately.  I spoke with him about the book and why he thinks Google Trends is ""the most important data set ever collected on the human psyche."" I also ask him about his most startling finding, which is that America is experiencing a crisis of self-induced abortions in places where access to abortion clinics is sparse.  Our lightly edited conversation follows.  Sean Illing  You refer to Google as a digital truth serum. What does it tell us about ourselves?  Seth Stephens-Davidowitz  People tell Google things that they don't tell to possibly anybody else, things they might not tell to family members, friends, anonymous surveys, doctors. People feel very comfortable confessing things to Google. In general, Google tells us that people are different than they present themselves. One way they're different, I have to say, is that they’re nastier and meaner than they often present themselves.  I've done a lot of research on racism, for example, and I was shocked by how frequently people make racist searches, particularly for jokes mocking African Americans. This concealed ugliness can predict a lot of behaviors, particularly in the political realm.  Sean Illing  Speaking of politics, you believed way back in early 2016 that Trump was a serious candidate. You were looking at Google search activity, saw a spike in racist and misogynistic searches, and thought that was a sign of things to come.  Seth Stephens-Davidowitz  Yeah, I did say that I thought Trump was going to win very, very early, but I'm not sure if that was based purely on the data or just because I'm a total pessimist. I always have been fairly pessimistic about this kind of thing.  Sean Illing  Welcome to the club.  Seth Stephens-Davidowitz  I'm always predicting horrible things are going to happen, with or without data. But I think there were definitely some clues on the internet that Trump should have been taken more seriously than other people were taking him.  Sean Illing  What were you seeing exactly?  Seth Stephens-Davidowitz  The first thing was that the level of racism in this country was a lot higher than I had realized. I think a lot of people thought that Trump would be done as soon as he started saying all these racially charged things. I think when you look at this internet data, you see the demand for this type of material.  I mean, I had even been studying white nationalist sites like Stormfront for a long time, long before most people knew about it, and still I was shocked by how widespread the appeal of these sites were.  Sean Illing  This is what we should’ve been paying attention to, not these outdated polling methods.  Seth Stephens-Davidowitz  You can't really predict using surveys who's going to turn out in an election because everybody says they're going to vote, nobody wants to admit that they have no intention of voting. But you can predict who's going to vote based on their Google searches. People search how to vote, or where to vote, or polling places weeks before an election and that predicts that turnout will be high.  In this election, you saw very, very clearly in the data that there was a huge decrease in these searches in cities with enormous African-American populations, for example. It was very clear in the Google search data that black turnout was going to be way down in 2016, and that was one of the reasons Clinton did so much worse than the polls predicted.  Sean Illing  The political utility of this data is obvious, but it seems like there’s no limit to what we can learn about ourselves. In the book, you call it ""the most important data set ever collected on the human psyche.""  Seth Stephens-Davidowitz  I think the only real competition is Facebook, and I don't think that's as interesting a data set because people are so much less honest on Facebook. People are really, really honest on Google, so they tell Google things that they don't tell anybody else. They search for answers to questions they won’t ask anyone else. I've found this over the past few years: Take any subject area and look at Google searches and you can find something new and interesting and surprising that we didn't know. Whether it's hatred or abortion or child abuse or political views or pregnancy or anxiety or depression. Pretty much every time I turn to Google data, there's something there that is interesting.  Sean Illing  I guess polls are still useful, but search histories are a much better way to get a sense of what people are thinking about controversial or personal subjects.  Seth Stephens-Davidowitz  Yeah, and those are the most interesting things.  Sean Illing  No doubt.  Seth Stephens-Davidowitz  They are also often the most important. One of the studies I talk about in the book is a study of Islamophobia. It's not really Islamophobia, it's like Islamo-rage, or something like that. It’s essentially people with horrifically violent thoughts toward Muslim Americans. People search things like “kill Muslims” or “I hate Muslims” or “Muslims are evil.” These people are basically maniacs and you can actually see minute-by-minute when these searches rise and when these searches fall.  What’s interesting about this is that we’re talking about a relatively small group of maniacs. The average American does not search “kill Muslims” or “I hate Muslims”; it's a small group but it's also an important group because these types of people can create a lot of problems. They are the ones who tend to commit hate crimes or even murder Muslims.  That’s what I mean when I say you can get insights on topics that are truly important.  Sean Illing  Let’s zoom back a bit and get a broader sense of the American psyche as revealed by Google. What do Americans fear the most or worry about the most?  Seth Stephens-Davidowitz  I'd say that one's own body is a pretty big one. If you look at Google AdWords data on bodily insecurity, people who go around looking for ways to lose weight or improve their body, these are almost as popular among men as among women, which is not usually talked about. Twenty percent of searches looking to change one's breasts are from men looking into how to get rid of man boobs. I think male bodily insecurity is not usually talked about but is extremely prevalent.  Sean Illing  That’s interesting.  Seth Stephens-Davidowitz  Yeah, and also not what you’d expect given our cultural biases.  Sean Illing  Have you found that people are basically dishonest about they actually care about? In the age of social media, everyone’s a warrior for justice — you post an article or two, proclaim your outrage or support, and boom you’re an “engaged” person. But that’s not real activism and it doesn’t require any real commitment.  Seth Stephens-Davidowitz  It’s a good question. I’ve explored this is in some of my Trump-related research. I think a lot of people exaggerate the extent to which they're anxious about Trump. It's kind of a game that people play. If you look at what really keeps people up at night, what really wakes them up at 3:00 am in a cold sweat, it tends to be economic concerns or health paranoia or legal fears — basically selfish concerns. But I think there's something a little bit unpleasant about that fact.  People like to say that they're anxious about more global concerns about Trump and what he might do to the world, rather than more selfish concerns about one's own economics or health or legal problems. I think people exaggerate. There's a lot of lying about what we actually care about and what actually moves us and what actually makes us sad, what actually makes us anxious.  Sean Illing  What’s the most shocking finding of your research?  Seth Stephens-Davidowitz  I'm pretty convinced that the United States has a self-induced abortion crisis right now based on the volume of search inquiries. I was blown away by how frequently people are searching for ways to do abortions themselves now. These searches are concentrated in parts of the country where it's hard to get an abortion and they rose substantially when it became harder to get an abortion. They're also, I calculate, missing pregnancies in these states that aren't showing up in either abortion or birth rates.  That's pretty disturbing and I think isn't really being talked about. But I think, based on the data, it's clearly going on.  Sean Illing  That’s appalling if it’s true. Give me some good news. Have you discovered anything pleasant?  Seth Stephens-Davidowitz  I think it’s refreshing to learn that we’re not alone in our anxieties or insecurities or desires. Alcoholics Anonymous has this phrase, don't compare your insides to other people's outsides. But that's hard because we don't see other people's insides, but I think with this search data, we actually, for the first time, do see other people's insides, and it shows that we should be easier on ourselves.  Sean Illing  Do you think we should spend less time online?  Seth Stephens-Davidowitz  Well, I want people to spend a lot of time online so that the data gets better and I can do more research.  Sean Illing  I guess I walked right into that answer. Would you at least say that people should take it less seriously, to not take their emotional cues from their Facebook feeds?  Seth Stephens-Davidowitz  Sure. Social media can be dangerous if you think that that's real life. It’s not, and we shouldn’t forget that. But people can buy my book and then anytime they're feeling jealous they can read it and be reminded that everyone’s a mess.  Sean Illing  I think we should leave it right there.

638,2037,10,15,2017,2017-10-15,Vox,Benching NFL players for protesting during the anthem would be illegal,"Last Sunday, Jerry Jones, the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, said he would bench players who did not stand during the national anthem. This threat was publicized nationally and applauded on Twitter by President Trump, who summarized the two men’s shared view: “Stand for Anthem or sit for game!”  On Wednesday, the president elaborated on his views, telling Fox News that the NFL “should have suspended” Colin Kaepernick for kneeling during the anthem because “you cannot disrespect our country, our flag, our anthem — you cannot do that.” It is quite possible the players have First Amendment protection against retaliation of this kind. The First Amendment generally protects citizens against the suppression of their speech by the government, not private entities like their employers. But when the president uses the power of his office to intimidate business owners into suppressing the speech of their employees — with both implied threats and specific ones — the possibility of a First Amendment violation becomes quite real.  Whatever the Constitution has to say about the matter, however, it is manifestly clear that Jones’s threat violates federal labor law. Benching, or otherwise disciplining, players who engage in anthem protests would be illegal.  The National Labor Relation Act forbids employers from taking adverse employment actions against workers who are engaged in “concerted activity for mutual aid or protection.”  So the first part of the labor law analysis, and the easiest, is whether “benching” counts as an adverse employment action of the sort the law prohibits. Some commentators have suggested that benching is not a sufficiently severe penalty to count (as they concede a heavy fine, or loss of job, might be). But anyone who has ever played sports, or watched sports, or had a kid who played sports, knows that benching is adverse. “Getting benched” is what happens to you when the coach wants to discipline or punish you. When your job is playing sports, getting benched is a pretty good definition of what adverse employment action means.  Employers can’t punish employees for “concerted activity for mutual aid”  The real issue in the anthem protest cases is whether the players’ actions constitute “concerted activity for mutual aid or protection,” which is what federal labor law protects. Again, the “concerted” prong is easy: There’s no question that the players involved are acting in concert with one another — i.e., together. The question is whether their anthem protests — which originated and remain directed in large part at questions of racial equality and justice, including the issue of police violence, as opposed to more traditional labor concerns, such as working conditions — are the kind of concerted activity that labor law shields against retaliation.  The fact that the protests are unmistakably “political” does not take them outside the scope of labor law. The Supreme Court, in Eastex v. NLRB, established — and the National Labor Relations Board has affirmed repeatedly — that labor law protects workers who engage in certain kinds of political advocacy. The limitation is that the political advocacy, to be protected by labor law, must relate to the employees’ status as employees. (Eastex involved Texas workers who, in a flyer promoting union solidarity, also called on workers to fight against a state “right to work” law and for minimum wage protections.)  And although, at first blush, the anthem protests may not seem to be about the players’ lives as players, there are several ways in which they most definitely are.  First, race discrimination — and certainly the acute kind that manifests as police violence — affects the targets of that discrimination across all spheres of their lives. Police violence directed at African-American men may happen away from the workplace, but that can’t mean that police violence has no impact on African-American men at work. Indeed, the idea that police violence, and other forms of race discrimination, can somehow be cabined away from work, just because that discrimination occurs away from work, is false. So when players protest societal discrimination against African-American men, this is a protest that concerns their lives as employees.  To be clear, labor law would not need to treat all types of off-work dynamics that potentially affect work as protected in order to treat the forms of race discrimination under protest here as protected. The law must draw lines of this sort all the time, and distinguishing things like racially discriminatory police violence from other forms of off-work behavior should be manageable.  Second, the NFL and the agreement the league has with the players stresses repeatedly that being an NFL player involves more than what happens on the field. For example, paragraph two of the standard player agreement states that a player must pledge to “conduct himself on and off the field with appropriate recognition of the fact that the success of professional football depends largely on public respect for and approval of those associated with the game.” In other words, the job of being a football player involves much more of what in many other occupations might be classified as non-work or non-employment matters. But the league can’t expand the definition of what it means to be an NFL player solely in order to restrict player conduct. Having defined the job as a public one, the league must then own the fact that players’ advocacy efforts around “public” issues — including race discrimination — concern the players as employees.  Protesting unfair punishment by bosses is core protected activity  Third, although all the protesters have solid protection from labor law for the reasons I’ve outlined, it would be even more blatantly illegal to bench anthem protesters in cases in which they are taking a knee as a means of showing support for teammates threatened with discipline for their actions — whether those threats come from a team owner or the president of the United States. For these protesters, taking a knee is a means of, among other things, expressing a view about what should and should not constitute a disciplinary offense at work. That kind of protest is the heartland of what labor law protects: It is absolutely core “concerted activity for mutual aid and protection.”  One final note. Even if anthem protests are protected by federal labor law, the players’ collective bargaining agreement could, in theory, waive their right to engage in them. The Supreme Court, however, has held that any such waiver has to be clear and unmistakable, and there is no such clear and unmistakable waiver in the players’ agreements that I’m aware of. Certainly, the language from paragraph two of the agreement — about conduct “on and off the field,” quoted above — doesn’t meet the standard.  Nor does language in paragraph 11 of the agreement, which allows a team to fire a player if the player “has engaged in personal conduct reasonably judged by Club to adversely affect or reflect on Club.” Again, it’s not specific enough.  There apparently also is a mention of the anthem in the “game operations manual” that suggests that players “should” stand during the anthem. It is unclear (at least to me) whether or how this manual is incorporated into the collective bargaining agreement. But the use of “should” rather than “must” makes it less than “clear and unmistakable” that the players’ rights in this respect have been waived.  The longer this goes on, the more evident it becomes that the players have a legal right to engage in the anthem protests. Labor law provides one such source of protection. Noah Zatz, a law professor at UCLA, has argued that Title VII, which forbids racial discrimination, provides another source.  Whatever the source of protection, however, the illegality of the threats issued by Jones and amplified by the president is clear.

1412,3030,11,3,2017,2017-11-03,Associated Press News,Boston College announces $150M expansion in the sciences," Boston College is betting big on the sciences.  The private Jesuit school, better known for its philosophy and economics programs, unveiled plans Friday for a $150 million science facility that will bring a new engineering major to campus.  School officials are calling it an ambitious step forward that combines the college’s longstanding strength in the liberal arts with its newer expansion into the sciences.  The crowning jewel of the 150,000-square-foot (13,935-square-meter) facility will be a new integrated science institute named after Apple executive Phil Schiller and his wife, Kim Gassett-Schiller, who donated $25 million for the project.  Schiller, a 1982 graduate of the school, said the institute aims to give scholars from the humanities and the sciences a place to team up on major global problems.  “This is where the best work comes from, as diverse minds with different experiences try to understand a problem together and solve things as a team,” said Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing. “That is where big leaps forward happen.”  Construction is scheduled to begin in spring 2019 at the school’s campus west of Boston. It will add research laboratories, classrooms and space for students and faculty to collaborate across disciplines.  It also will bring a new engineering major to campus as the school seeks an edge in competition with other major universities.  The new facility is Boston College’s latest step in a recent push toward the sciences. Last year, it became one of 115 universities in the U.S. designated as a top research institution by the Carnegie Foundation, which classifies schools based on their research spending and staffing levels, among other factors.  The shift follows in the steps of other private schools that have pursued aggressive expansions into science and research fields, which can add prestige — and a source of revenue— for universities.  Nearby Harvard University is continuing work on a $1 billion science and engineering complex in Boston’s Allston neighborhood after the project was put on hold amid an economic slump in 2010.  North Carolina’s Wake Forest University also introduced a new engineering program this year, blending a science curriculum with the private school’s liberal arts tradition.  At Boston College, officials say the new Schiller institute aims to tackle projects ranging from the development of clean energy to technology that can diagnose and treat humans in poor areas around the world.  The school enrolls about 15,000 students at its campus west of Boston. Last year it had the No. 40 largest endowment among U.S. colleges, valued at nearly $2.1 billion, according to an annual study by the National Association of College and University Business Officers.  School President William Leahy thanked Schiller for the donation on Friday, saying it will “have a profound effect on the university’s ability to address pressing societal needs through advanced scientific research.”  ___  Follow Collin Binkley on Twitter at @cbinkley",5.0,1,[5.0]
829,2286,10,6,2017,2017-10-06,Vox,The tax bill opens the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling,"Alaskan lawmakers are finally about to receive a prize they’ve coveted for decades: permission from Congress to open up sections of the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil and natural gas drilling.  The Republican tax reform bill, which contains language that directs Congress to conduct lease sales for energy development in the refuge, cleared the House on a party-line vote Tuesday and will likely pass the Senate.  Ryan mentions ANWR opening in the tax bill and some members working on issue since he was in 2nd grade. Alaska rep Don Young pumps his fist in the air and yells ""yes."" — Casey J. Wooten (@Casey_J_Wooten) December 19, 2017  To legislators from Alaska, this is a chance to make the state more economically resilient and refill Alaska’s Permanent Fund, which has been paying shrinking dividends from oil and gas revenue to Alaskans in recent years.  But time after time, Alaskan leaders have been stymied — as environmentalists have made blocking drilling in ANWR a rallying cry and Congress has offered tepid support at best and outright hostility at worst.  Now after nearly 40 years, the Alaska delegation — led by Republicans Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Rep. Don Young, currently the longest-serving member of Congress — is about to achieve this goal.  The legislation is attached to the Republican tax reform plan, and after months of horse-trading, Republicans have secured the votes in the Senate to pass the bill.  House members shook hands and fist-bumped with @repdonyoung on the floor after the tax vote, congratulating him for winning on ANWR. After 44 years, one of his biggest victories. — Liz Ruskin (@lruskin) December 19, 2017  Crucially, ANWR would add revenue to the tax reform package, which slashes taxes for corporations and the wealthy.  The Senate Budget Committee directed the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to come up with $1 billion in revenue to help close the budget deficit. Were ANWR to be to leased oil and gas drillers, the Congressional Budget Office estimates it would generate $5 billion over 10 years for the federal government.  “It would generate substantial revenue for every level of government,” Murkowski said.  But as Vox’s Dylan Matthews reported, the tax plan overall would add $1.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years; ANWR would take a tiny step toward closing that gap.  With her support, Murkowski helped cement the fate of the first tax reform package in 30 years, trading away her backing of the Affordable Care Act (she was one of three senators to torpedo repeal of Obamacare earlier this year) in favor of the prospect of extracting oil from the arctic refuge.  I joined a public mtg. of Senate/House conferees on the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, emphasizing my support for this bill that allows access to a small portion of the non-wilderness 1002 Area to responsible energy development & benefits our families & businesses https://t.co/5lOCNB09RQ — Sen. Lisa Murkowski (@lisamurkowski) December 14, 2017  But there are several catches: Low oil and gas prices mean that drillers aren’t hurting for new wells. And not all Alaskans are on board with opening up ANWR, while environmental groups and Democrats are gearing up to fight it every step of the way.  “Our battle here is to make sure it is never opened,” said Sen. Edward Markey (D-MA) at a rally in October. “We think that big oil is going to get another big black eye.”  Let’s walk through the return of this familiar battle, and why Alaskan lawmakers are about to declare victory.  ANWR has been a central fight of environmental politics for years  Long before environmentalists and the fossil fuel industry traded blows over the Keystone XL pipeline and hydraulic fracturing, ANWR was the definitive issue dividing them.  The case for establishing the refuge was first laid out in the journal of the Sierra Club in 1953, and groups ranging from the Natural Resources Defense Council to the Audubon Society have all campaigned and litigated against Alaska’s attempts to allow drilling in ANWR for decades.  One of the last untouched places on earth is about to be given away to the oil industry. #ProtectTheArctic #ArcticRefuge pic.twitter.com/ISGYyrtD7a — CAP Energy Policy (@CAPenergypolicy) October 6, 2017  The push for drilling has also spanned generations of Alaskan politicians. Murkowski’s father, Frank Murkowski, added pro-drilling language into a Senate budget in 1995 that was vetoed by then-President Bill Clinton.  The 19 million-acre refuge, managed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, was created in 1960 and remains the largest wildlife refuge in the United States. It’s home to polar bears, musk oxen, and migratory birds from six continents, and is the calving ground for the porcupine caribou. There are no roads and fewer than 500 people living in or near the refuge.  In 1980, President Jimmy Carter signed the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, expanding ANWR and opening the door to drilling in a 1.5 million-acre region of the refuge. However, there was a snag: Drilling would require an environmental impact study and approval from Congress.  Leaving the fate of oil drilling in ANWR to lawmakers has let this issue drag out for decades as support and opposition to drilling waxed and waned. Environmentalists have managed to successfully persuade Democrats (and some Republicans) to defend it.  But without definitive legislation supporting drilling, and without any rulings declaring ANWR completely off limits, the proposal has remained in limbo.  Why Alaska wants to open up ANWR so badly  Every October, each Alaskan who has been in the state longer than one year gets a check for around $2,200, a dividend from the state’s $61 billion Permanent Fund. The fund is larger than any private foundation, endowment, or union pension trust, and is the largest sovereign wealth fund in the United States.  The money for the Permanent Fund comes from oil and gas production in the state. Alaska residents are paid a dividend from earnings on the fund, not the principal. That means the dividend check can go up or down, even to zero, depending on the fortunes of the state’s energy industry.  In particular, the money is generated from the Trans-Alaska oil pipeline, which provides the state with 85 percent of its budget. Alaska does not have a state income tax or a sales tax, so the bulk of the revenue has to come from energy.  At its peak in the 1980s, the pipeline transported more than 2 million barrels of oil per day. But oil production is now a quarter of that, so the state is facing increasing pressure to raise cash.  The state’s budget deficit is now at $3.7 billion. And this year’s dividend payment from the Permanent Fund was $1,100 — about half of what Alaskans have received in previous years, drawing the ire of many in the state.  That’s why Alaskan lawmakers have renewed their push for ANWR drilling.  “This is not so much about the oil industry; it’s really about Alaska,” said Athan Manuel, director of the lands protection program at the Sierra Club. “The state of Alaska has been salivating for this kind of stuff.”  But it’s not clear how much oil is really there. And oil companies aren’t that interested in it.  Though Alaskan politicians have long painted ANWR as a rich oil field just waiting to be exploited, it’s difficult to say just how much oil really is there.  There’s only been one exploratory well drilled in the territory, back in 1986, and the drillers haven’t disclosed what they found, which some analysts have taken to mean that there’s less oil there than hoped.  USGS estimated in 1998 that there is between 4.3 billion and 11.8 billion barrels of oil in the 1002 area, a rather vast margin of error.  The federal government has also banned seismic testing in ANWR to measure oil deposits. The process involves setting off explosives or rattling the earth with 40,000-pound thumper trucks and measuring the vibrations to detect underground reservoirs. The Trump administration is now taking steps to allow this technique in the refuge.  However, other parts of northern Alaska have yielded major oil finds, and the state has extracted oil there for more than 50 years, currently producing about 500,000 barrels of crude every day, according to Kara Moriarty, president and CEO of the Alaska Oil and Gas Association.  “It’s a very mature basin, but the future is incredibly bright,” she said, adding that oil finds in Alaska “could be producing for at least another 40 years plus.”  Moriarty also noted that the oil industry isn’t planning to develop the entire swath of 1002 lands, keeping most of its activities in a stark, treeless 2,000-acre region on the coastal plain that is far away from the majestic vistas that often illustrate ANWR discussions.  “It’s a very sensitive environment; we’re very mindful of that,” she said. “But it’s not the mountain and lake pictures that are often used. That area is permanently set aside and can never be developed.”  But environmental groups don’t think it’s possible to develop energy in the Arctic without damaging it, even on a remote and limited stretch of land. “Even if they don’t spill a drop, they are industrializing a wilderness area,” said the Sierra Club’s Manuel.  At the same time, the energy landscape has changed radically since drilling in ANWR became a possibility more than 30 years ago, with US crude oil production reaching record highs and prices holding below $50 a barrel, driven largely by the shale oil and gas boom.  Now with a glut of fossil fuels in the US and around the world, oil and gas companies are offering muted support for new drilling in the Arctic.  “If the 1002 area was authorized for leasing, we would consider it against other opportunities in our portfolio, just as we do with exploration opportunities worldwide,” said Daren Beaudo, a spokesperson for ConocoPhillips, in an email. “That being said, we see tremendous potential in National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska and remain focused on our projects and exploration plans in the Reserve.”  Frank Wolak, an economics professor and director of the program on sustainable energy at Stanford University, said current market conditions mean that drilling in the Arctic, which tends to be more expensive and difficult than drilling in the lower 48, doesn’t make much sense when energy prices are poised to stay low.  Environmental groups have also been preparing for decades to fight Arctic drilling if Congress ever gives it a green light.  “It’s going to be litigation like you’ve never seen from the environmental community,” Wolak said. “Why take that on when oil prices are at their current levels?”  Alaskans who are close to ANWR are divided on it  Bernadette Demientieff, a member of the Gwich’in tribe and executive director of the Gwich’in Steering Committee, said her tribe considers the coastal plain of the refuge to be sacred and that it should be protected from drilling.  The tribe historically followed caribou herds in the region, which spend part of the year on the coastal plain, but have faced increasing pressure as average temperatures in the region have risen.  “Many of our people now have to travel hundreds and hundreds of miles just to hunt the caribou we have depended on,” Demientieff said.  Now the tribe is concerned that caribou herds will decline further with the advent of drilling, just as herd numbers have fallen in other areas of Alaska’s north slope where mineral extraction is permitted.  The prospect of losing a valuable food source and cultural element would be devastating to a people that are already facing immense environmental pressures.  “Not only our we dealing with climate change, it’s also food security, it’s also our identity,” Demientieff said.  But other indigenous groups have thrown their weight behind drilling proposals.  In September, the Voice of the Arctic Iñupiat, a group representing indigenous people in the region, came out in favor of energy development in ANWR.  “Collectively, we are concerned about the future of our communities and, as of today, we stand together, with our members from Kaktovik, in support of ANWR development as part of the economic solution for the Arctic Slope region,” John Hopson Jr., mayor of Wainwright, Alaska, and vice chair of Voice of the Arctic Iñupiat, in a press release.  He cited the need for economic development in the remote region and the potential for improving schools, sanitation systems, and clinics with revenue from drilling.  Murkowski will have to walk a fine line here. She owes her political life to tribal groups in Alaska who mounted a write-in campaign for her after she lost her primary to Tea Party candidate Joe Miller in 2010, and the ANWR issue is threatening to divide Alaska natives.  This is going to be a long fight  The divide among Alaskans over the fate of ANWR has an analog on Capitol Hill.  Washington Sen. Maria Cantwell scuttled the last major effort to open ANWR to drilling back in 2005, when she blocked Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens, then the longest-serving Republican in the Senate, from tacking on drilling to a military spending bill with a filibuster.  ""Destroying a national wildlife refuge is not the answer to our nation’s energy problems,"" she said at the time.  Cantwell is now the ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, where she sits right next to Lisa Murkowski.  The two senators have worked together on energy legislation, but on ANWR, they couldn’t be further apart.  On the Senate floor in October, Murkowski reiterated her case for drilling in the Arctic and called arguments against it “stale.”  We will balance the potential impacts of development, and that's why we have not avoided environmental reviews. We will not sacrifice wildlife for the sake of development. There is no question that development & environmental protection can and do exist in Alaska. — Sen. Lisa Murkowski (@lisamurkowski) November 15, 2017  However, passing the tax bill doesn’t guarantee that companies will drill in ANWR. The language of the legislation only directs the government to hold mining and drilling lease sales for the refuge. If no one buys, no one drills.  A future Congress could also designate the 1002 region a wilderness area, effectively ending the prospects for drilling altogether.  Legal action could easily stall the permitting process, which requires a public comment period at almost every stage of development, from awarding leases to siting to drilling, creating openings for lawsuits.  “We’re expecting litigation at each and every step,” said Moriarty. “If the budget resolution passes, I’m not sure you’d see production” before the end of Trump’s potential second term.  And even if drillers clear those administrative barriers, actually finding suitable drilling sites can be a difficult process, since oil companies can only explore for oil in the winter when the Alaskan ground is hard enough to support ice roads.  That means it would take upward of a decade before any oil from ANWR starts coursing through the Trans-Alaska pipeline.  “This is something that would be a very long-term play,” Moriarty said.

And people agree, and if you look at the level of approval of the media, of general media -- if you look at it from the day I started running, to now, I'm so proud I have been able to convince people how fake it is, because it has taken a nosedive.  Except for your show, of course, and Sean [Hannity], and a few of them. There's some very good ones, and I have to say, Fox has treated me fairly. And I don't mean good, but they've treated me fairly. I don't want to be treated good, I just want to be treated fairly.
