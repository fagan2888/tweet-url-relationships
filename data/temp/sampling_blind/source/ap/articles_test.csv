8,96,8,30,2017,2017-08-30,Associated Press News,Want to help? Here’s how to give in Harvey’s wake,"Want to help? Here’s how to give in Harvey’s wake  NEW YORK (AP) — Charities are stepping up their donation requests in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, which has devastated South Texas and on Wednesday hit southwestern Louisiana. At least 18 people have died, and countless residents are displaced from their homes.  While the urge to donate clothes and other supplies is natural, money is the quickest, most effective contribution most people can make during times of disaster, charities and philanthropy experts say. And donating directly through a website gets money to a charity faster than a text donation, even though the text might seem easier.  Here’s how to make sure you are giving in a way that matters the most.  ___  GIVE TO ESTABLISHED RELIEF AGENCIES  GuideStar’s website has a database that lets you vet charities . You can find information on a charity’s expenses, assets and revenue, as well as its programs.  Stacy Palmer, editor of The Chronicle of Philanthropy, also suggests looking at a charity’s website for information on how it will use donations. And look through local news reports for information on a charity’s work, or contact the local United Way and the local Community Foundation — in this case Houston’s.  It’s up to you whether to go with a local charity that might know the area better, or a national charity that has wider reach. Palmer says “both kinds of organizations have their place right now.”  ___  TEXTING TO GIVE?  It might be tempting to make a donation through text and have the phone company charge it on your phone bill. It’s easy, and it might feel as though it’s the quickest way to get money to a charity.  But Palmer says that’s not the case, as charities have to wait for the phone companies to release the money.  The quickest way to give is to go to the charity’s website and donate directly, using a credit or debit card. That said, relief agencies will need money beyond first few days or even weeks, so if the ease of text donations appeals to you, tap away. To donate $10 to the Red Cross via text, send a text message saying “REDCROSS” to the number 90999.  Apple users in the U.S. can also donate to the American Red Cross through the company’s iTunes and app stores. Amounts range from $5 to $200, and you can’t use store credit.  ___  TIMING  Donations often pour in immediately after disaster strikes but peter out during the long recovery process. While there are a lot of immediate needs, Palmer says, “charities are going to need support on the long haul.”  Consider saving some of your money so you can donate again in a few weeks or months. Better yet, set up a recurring donation to support your chosen charity over time.  Some charities will say when they have raised enough for a particular disaster and use any extra money for their general fund, Palmer says. This isn’t bad.  “One of the things this disaster shows is that it’s important to have resilience,” she says. “It’s smart to just give and say that it can be used wherever it’s most needed.”  ___  CROWDFUNDING  Group fundraising services such as GoFundMe let people raise money for friends, families, neighbors or themselves — as well as for charity. As always, do your homework before giving to a stranger or cause online.  GoFundMe has a special page for Hurricane Harvey pleas for charities, individuals and families. GlobalGiving, a crowdfunding site for charities, is trying to raise $2 million for local relief and recovery efforts.  Remember that donations are tax-deductible only if they go to a registered non-profit or charity. Otherwise, they are generally considered gifts.  ___  HOLD OFF ON MATERIAL DONATIONS  Donating food, clothing and household items can complicate and even hinder relief efforts, experts say. After Superstorm Sandy in 2012, for example, reports cited relief agencies not knowing what to do with the piles of clothing and other unsolicited items pouring in.  The U.S. Center for Disaster Information says such donations “require transportation — which is expensive and logistically complicated — and a pre-identified recipient on the ground who will receive the shipment, pay customs and other fees, sort and distribute the items.”  Unsolicited goods, the agency says , are “never required in early stages of response, and they compete with priority relief items for transportation and storage.”  It doesn’t mean there will never be a time or place for such donations — check with relief agencies as time passes. And a few charities have announced immediate needs for material donations; the Houston Humane Society has set up an Amazon wish list for the most needed items.  ___  CONSIDER SPECIAL NEEDS  Seniors, the disabled, children and even pets are particularly vulnerable during disasters. Consider donating to charities that focus on their needs.  The Texas Diaper Bank , for example, says diapers (whether for babies or adults) are not provided by disaster relief agencies. Again, these charities need money — not boxes of diapers you picked up at Costco.  Save The Children is setting up “child-friendly spaces” inside shelters to give kids a safe area to play and get support from trained experts and “get a sense of normalcy” during disasters, spokeswoman Jordyn Linsk said. The organization is also distributing infant and toddler supplies.  Portlight Strategies helps people with disabilities, older adults and their families recover after disasters.  To help animals, check the San Antonio Humane Society, which has set up an emergency fund for pets and strays, or the Houston Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals . And the Houston Humane Society needs money, too.  ___  RELIGIOUS AND HUMANITARIAN GROUPS  Some of the religious organizations are “some of the strongest relief groups,” Palmer says.  Those accepting donations include Catholic Charities USA, International Orthodox Christian Charities , Islamic Relief USA , the Jewish Federations of North America and Tzu Chi USA , a humanitarian organization with Buddhist roots.  ___  CHECK OUT MATCHES  Facebook says it will match every dollar raised through its service, up to $1 million, for the Center for Disaster Philanthropy’s Hurricane Harvey Recovery Fund. The money will support local recovery and rebuilding efforts. U.S. Facebook users are getting a message at the top of their news feed on how to donate.  Google, meanwhile, is matching $1 million in donations to the American Red Cross. To donate, go to http://www.google.org/harvey-relief . The company also matched donations from employees and said Tuesday it donated $750,000 between its nonprofit arm, Google.org, and employee contributions to organizations such as the American Red Cross, Habitat for Humanity and Save the Children.  Some companies, such as the Walt Disney Co., are also matching employee donations.",3.5,1,[3.5]

Harvey's winds and rains have damaged or destroyed many small businesses in the storm's path along the Gulf Coast, and left others in limbo. (Melissa Phillip/Houston Chronicle via AP, File)  With the animals sent to safety before Harvey hit, the owners of CityVet in Houston kept watch on their empty practice by security camera, hoping not to see floodwaters rush in.  But they lost the video stream Monday morning, apparently when power to the building near Houston’s Galleria failed. So it was impossible to assess if any damage was occurring, said Paul Kline, a veterinarian based in and watching from Dallas. To his relief, the video came back Tuesday and “we could see cars going by on the street outside — a good sign,” Kline said. By Wednesday, with the rains gone, he could see the practice had indeed escaped the flooding in the area.  Plenty of small business owners spent a long five days, waiting to see if the rainfall that totaled more than 50 inches in some places would flood their businesses. Harvey’s winds and rains damaged or destroyed many small businesses in the storm’s path along the Gulf Coast.  It was a tornado spawned by Harvey that destroyed the office of Kenneth Bryant’s used-car dealership in Katy, Texas, just west of Houston. The winds Saturday morning picked up the office and slammed it into the building next door.  “I lost everything in there: titles to vehicles, keys, paperwork, computers,” said Bryant, whose business was not insured. Two of the 10 cars in his inventory were destroyed.  There was more bad news on Wednesday: The remaining cars had been flooded. Bryant won’t know how severely they were damaged until he was able to unlock them.  “Where do we go from here? I don’t know. It’s going to be such a long road ahead,” Bryant said.  For many companies, damage to their premises was just the start. Some lost inventory that would cost them future sales. Workers were stranded or dealing with the devastation of their homes. Companies that couldn’t operate were losing revenue and profits every day.  Fiyyaz Pirani estimates that his Houston-based company, Medology, lost $100,000 in new business. It’s been operating with six staffers instead of its usual 60 since the storm began, and accommodating only existing customers.  “We had a couple of employees who sustained a lot of damage to their homes, and some people are in shelters,” he said.  The company, which helps patients get low-cost lab tests and other services, moved back to its regular location Tuesday from temporary quarters, with generator power but no air conditioning. Staffers were working around some puddles of water at their top-floor office.  Eleanor Rem had several inches of water in her Houston home, which also houses her business. Rem, who helps children with dyslexia learn to read, opted not to try what might have been a difficult evacuation with an 88-year-old relative.  The rains that flooded her street, backyard and driveway on Monday began creeping into her home. She and her husband got their first-floor furniture upstairs, but the carpet was soaked. Rem said she was constantly checking to see how bad the damage was.  “We’re pretty exhausted. You’re kind of nervous to go to sleep,” she said Wednesday. She expects she won’t be able to work for several weeks, in part because her students may not be able to get to her home.  Other business owners who tried to keep an eye on their companies by watching the video from surveillance cameras ran into the same problems as the veterinary practice.  With all three of Clint Hall’s Beef Jerky Outlet stores near Houston in danger of flooding, he watched from his home in Cypress. The Galveston Island store got a foot of water as the rains continued Monday and Tuesday, but he could see the Tomball location was safe. The League City shop lost power and its cameras on Saturday, so Hall had to rely on the owner of a nearby pizzeria for periodic updates. When the rains finally stopped, it had suffered one minor leak.  It was a hard five days. As Hall watched his cameras, he said, “we’re doing as well as we can.” He planned to open at least two of the stores Wednesday.  Lindsey Rose King spent five days not knowing whether the inventory for Mostess, her home decor gift box company, was safe. The warehouse where it’s all stored — cloth napkins and tablecloths, bottles of spices and cocktail mixes and other items — is in the Galleria section. The warehouse owners had to evacuate their home and couldn’t monitor the situation.  “It’s nerve-wracking. If that inventory gets wet, that’s my whole business,” King said. But Wednesday morning, the email came: Although the building did get some water, King’s merchandise was safe and dry.  Merin Guthrie worried about the possibility that water had seeped into the old loft building near downtown Houston that houses Kit, her clothing design business. Her studio is on the second floor, but friends in similar buildings said they had water coming in through their windows. Even if her fabric, samples and sewing equipment were dry, there was a threat of mold.  She got into the building Wednesday morning, found that water had indeed gotten in, but that her supplies and equipment were OK.  “You have to cross your fingers and hope for the best,” Guthrie said.  _____  Follow Joyce Rosenberg at www.twitter.com/JoyceMRosenberg.

U.S. stocks are quiet early Wednesday, Aug. 30, 2017, as technology companies rise while energy companies continue to fall as investors sort through the ongoing damage caused by Harvey. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)  LONDON (AP) — Upbeat economic figures from around the world helped shore up global stock markets on Thursday ahead of a raft of U.S. data that could determine the scale of upcoming rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.  KEEPING SCORE: In Europe, Germany’s DAX rose 0.6 percent to 12,072 while Britain’s FTSE 100 advanced 0.7 percent to 7,419. The CAC 40 in France was 0.7 percent higher too at 5,091. U.S. stocks were poised for a steady opening with Dow futures and the broader S&P 500 futures up 0.2 percent.  US DATA: Following jitters at the start of the week over North Korea’s firing of a missile over Japan, the mood has improved somewhat with most investors monitoring a raft of economic data that culminates with Friday’s U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for August. That could help shape market expectations over the pace of interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.  ANALYST TAKE: “Of course, Friday’s jobs report is widely regarding as the most important data release each month due to the insight it offers on hiring, wages and therefore potential future inflation pressures,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA. “Today’s data though is arguably equally important, if not more so at the moment, as it contains the latest inflation numbers — as per the Fed’s preferred measure — as well as income and spending figures.”  EUROZONE INFLATION: Inflation across the 19-country eurozone struck a four-month high of 1.5 percent in the year to August largely because of higher energy costs, in a development that’s unlikely to alter expectations that the European Central Bank will play it safe at next week’s policy meeting. The increase was anticipated in financial markets, but inflation remains below the European Central Bank’s goal of just below 2 percent.  CHINA MANUFACTURING: An official gauge of Chinese factory activity improved for a 13th straight month in August. The preliminary version of the purchasing managers’ index from the China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing and the National Bureau of Statistics rose to 51.7 from July’s 51.4 on a 100-point scale on which numbers above 50 show activity expanding. An index of new orders rose to 53.1 from July’s 52.8.  ASIA’S DAY: The Shanghai Composite Index was unchanged at 3,360.81 while Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.7 percent to 19,646.24. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng shed 0.4 percent to 27,970.30 and Seoul’s Kospi lost 0.4 percent to 2,363.19. Sydney’s S&P-ASX 200 advanced 0.8 percent to 5,714.50.  ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude rose 28 cents to $46.24 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange while Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 35 cents to trade at $51.08 in London.  CURRENCIES: The euro was down 0.4 percent at $1.1837 while the dollar rose 0.3 percent to 110.55 yen.",4.5,1,[4.5]
19,145,8,30,2017,2017-08-30,Associated Press News,"Harvey knocks out more refineries, shifting global oil flows","ADDS NAME OF REFINERY - This aerial photo shows the Flint Hills Resources oil refinery near downtown Houston on Tuesday, Aug. 29, 2017. (AP Photo/D1avid J. Phillip)  DALLAS (AP) — Hurricane Harvey is sending pump prices higher for U.S. motorists and causing temporary shifts in the flow of oil and gasoline around the world after taking down a huge chunk of U.S. refining capacity.  It will be days or even weeks before the energy sector in the southeast Texas Gulf Coast is back to normal operations as it deals with flooding in the aftermath of Harvey, which has been downgraded to a tropical storm. The region from Corpus Christi, Texas, where Harvey made landfall, to the Louisiana state line accounts for about 3 percent of the U.S. economy and is a crucial export market for oil and chemicals.  Wednesday brought news that the nation’s biggest refinery, which was already running below half-speed, had begun a complete shutdown. The Motiva Enterprises plant in Port Arthur, Texas, run by a unit of the state-owned oil company of Saudi Arabia, was the latest domino to fall among Gulf Coast refineries.  More than one-fifth of U.S. refining capacity has been shuttered, according to S&P Global Platts.  With that, gasoline futures headed higher for a third straight day. They had climbed 10 cents to $1.88 a gallon Wednesday  Retail gas prices climbed, too, up 2 cents a gallon on Wednesday and 7 cents in the past week, to a national average price of $2.42 per gallon, according to Gasbuddy.  “In terms of product price increases, it might get worse before it gets better,” said Rob Smith, an energy analyst with IHS Markit.  It could take two weeks or longer before big refineries in the Houston area can recover from a record-setting deluge and resume normal operations. That assumes they didn’t suffer serious damage, which is still unknown.  Harvey isn’t the first big storm to hit the refinery-rich Gulf Coast, but the oil industry has undergone big changes since the last major interruption from Hurricane Ike in 2008.  The so-called shale revolution has led to a surge in oil production in the U.S., increasing the nation’s exports of crude oil and gasoline to Mexico and other places in Latin America, and diesel to Europe.  When the U.S. can’t produce enough gasoline or diesel to meet export demands, other regions are forced to look for replacement supplies “and the backfill has to come from further away,” said Richard Joswick, an analyst with S&P Global Platts. “It has to come from Asia even.”  The result will be higher prices, but it should be just a one- or two-week problem, Joswick said.  Patrick DeHaan, an analyst for GasBuddy, predicts that U.S. gasoline prices will top out around $2.50 or $2.55 a gallon, an increase of up to 20 cents since Harvey hit, with bigger spikes closer to the Gulf.  The recovery from Harvey will mimic the storm’s path from west to east. Flint Hill Resources’ refinery in Corpus Christi, where Harvey made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane, could begin to restart — a process that takes days — as early as Wednesday. Other refineries in the area are likely to do the same later this week.  “It takes some time to start up a refinery under normal circumstances, and it wouldn’t be surprising if they run into hiccups,” said Smith, the HIS Markit analyst. “It could be a week if not longer before Corpus Christi is at normal operations.”  Exxon, Shell and other companies have reported to Texas regulators that some of their storage tanks and other facilities near Houston were damaged by the torrential rains and flooding. Most of the reports seem to indicate relatively minor damage, but still it could be days before crews can assess matters and make repairs.  Even once the refineries are running, pipelines and ports are needed to carry their gasoline, diesel and other fuels to consumers.  A major pipeline supplying the East Coast with gasoline remains shut down — partly because with refineries closed, there is nothing to ship, but also because of damage in at least three areas. Another pipeline that carries crude from the big Permian Basin field in Texas to Houston-area refineries is also closed.  Other sectors are also slowly emerging from Harvey’s mess.  —INSURANCE: Damage estimates from wind, storm surges and flooding are soaring, with Moody’s Analytics putting them between $51 billion and $75 billion. RMS, a company that advises insurers, estimates the cost at $70 billion to $90 billion. TD Economics said Harvey will cut 0.1 to 0.4 points from U.S. third-quarter economic growth.  — SHIPPING: In a hopeful sign, port officials in Corpus Christi say that an initial check turned up some damage from Harvey’s landfall over the weekend, but they hope to restart shipping on Monday. First, however, the Coast Guard will have to declare the shipping lanes clear, and boat pilots will have to be satisfied it’s safe.  All four ports in the Houston area remain closed and aren’t likely to reopen for several days.  — TRAVEL: Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said Houston’s two airports would resume limited service late Wednesday afternoon.  United Airlines planned to operate three departures and three arrivals Wednesday night at Bush Intercontinental Airport, a spokesman said. Other carriers, such as American Airlines, planned to wait until Thursday. At Hobby Airport, Southwest Airlines, the dominant carrier, doesn’t plan any flights before Saturday, according to a spokeswoman.  More than 1,600 U.S. flights had been canceled by afternoon, most of them at the Houston airports, according to tracking service FlightAware.",3.5,1,[3.5]
34,202,8,31,2017,2017-08-31,Associated Press News,AP Explains: Harvey shines light on flood insurance program," The massive flooding Harvey has caused in Texas and Louisiana comes as Congress weighs renewing a federal flood insurance program that continually pays out more than it takes in through premiums, potentially leaving taxpayers on the hook for $24.6 billion and counting.  The National Flood Insurance Program expires Sept. 30. Congress is likely to reauthorize the program before then because failure to do so would disrupt coastal real estate markets. If the program expires, current policies would remain in effect, but no new policies could be issued.  The question for lawmakers when they return from the August recess next week is whether to pass a short-term extension that keeps the program running largely as-is for the next few months or pass a long-term extension that makes more drastic changes and puts the program on firmer financial footing.  Here’s a look at the program and how some lawmakers are looking to change it.  ___  HOW DID THE PROGRAM START?  Congress created the National Flood Insurance Program in 1968 to reduce the growing expense the federal government assumed after natural disasters to help repair damaged homes and businesses.  One of the key goals of the program was to get cities and counties to reduce the risk of flooding and better protect buildings from flood waters.  If the communities agree to undertake such steps and join the program, their residents and businesses can then purchase federal flood insurance to protect themselves from losses. When communities don’t participate, it means their residents and business owners cannot buy federal flood insurance and are thus ineligible for a federally backed loan.  ___  WHO GETS COVERAGE THROUGH THE NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM?  Homeowners who live in areas that have a 1 percent chance of being inundated by flood waters in any given year must purchase flood insurance as a condition of having a federally backed mortgage.  About 5 million policies are in effect for individuals and businesses. The policies generate about $3.3 billion in premiums annually. Still, studies have shown that many Americans living in these particularly vulnerable flood zones bypass the requirement to buy flood insurance. A 2006 government study found that compliance was lowest in the Midwest and highest in the West.  ___  WHERE IS THE PROGRAM WORKING WELL?  The Federal Emergency Management Agency estimates that the flood-control efforts communities have undertaken as a result of their participation in the program prevents nearly $1.9 billion in flood losses annually.  ___  WHERE IS THE PROGRAM NOT WORKING?  A program that is supposed to pay for itself is clearly not doing so. A spending bill enacted after Superstorm Sandy authorized the program to borrow up to $30.4 billion. The damage from Harvey will potentially lead FEMA to hit that borrowing level. If it does, FEMA would eventually need authorization from Congress before borrowing any more money to pay out claims.  The growing debt level is why lawmakers such as Rep. Jeb Hensarling, the Republican chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, say the program is unsustainable. Hensarling calls Harvey a “wake-up call” that an overhaul is needed to stave off a taxpayer bailout.  Still, it’s a difficult balance. If premiums rise too much to make the program self-sustainable, it discourages people from living and opening businesses in the more flood-prone regions of the country.  ___  WHAT CHANGES ARE BEING CONSIDERED BY CONGRESS?  Hensarling’s committee has already passed a series of bills that would increase premiums by 8 percent annually for certain policies instead of the current 5 percent, among other changes.  The panel has since reined that in to a 6.5 percent increase that will be phased in gradually, a move that helped attract support from influential trade groups representing home builders and real estate agents. The House legislation would require FEMA to raise collection rates for a reserve fund by 1 percent each year to help pay future claims. The legislation also seeks to boost the private flood insurance marketplace, clarifying that flood insurance policies written by private carriers satisfy the mandatory purchase requirements that come with obtaining a federally-backed mortgage. Hensarling said he believes more flood insurance offerings from private companies would bring about the kind of competition that could make policies more affordable.  The top Democrat on the committee, California Rep. Maxine Waters, said that the fee and premium increases being pursued were still too much in her view and she encouraged House colleagues to “consider the thoughtful, bipartisan process in the Senate as an alternative to this anti-homeowner bill.”  There are competing bills in the Senate, with one bipartisan measure capping premium fee increases at 10 percent and suspending the interest payments the program makes to the U.S. Treasury for the money it has borrowed over the years.",4.5,1,[4.5]
35,204,8,31,2017,2017-08-31,Associated Press News,Chemical plant explosion thrusts Arkema into spotlight,"A man talks with officers at a roadblock less than three miles from the Arkema Inc. chemical plant Thursday, Aug. 31, 2017, in Crosby, Texas. The Houston-area chemical plant that lost power after Harvey engulfed the area in extensive floods was rocked by multiple explosions early Thursday, the plant's operator said. The Arkema Inc. plant had been left without refrigeration for chemicals that become volatile as the temperature rises. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull)  Arkema SA is not exactly a household name, but its products are found in everything from plastics in automotive parts to adhesives for baby diapers. The company also claims to be the third-largest producer of hydrogen peroxide in the world.  But now it has a new distinction after Arkema reported two explosions and black smoke coming from its plant in Crosby, Texas early Thursday morning, raising serious health and safety concerns.  Records show that the plant, located about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northeast of Houston, was fined nearly $110,000 in February by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration over 10 safety violations found during an inspection.  Investigators classified the violations as “serious,” meaning there were workplace hazards that could cause an accident or illness that would “most likely result in death or serious physical harm.”  The gravity of six of the violations were rated a 10. But the electronic records don’t further explain the circumstances of the violations, what investigators uncovered and any improvements Arkema pledged to make. OSHA later reduced its fines to just over $90,000.  Arkema warned investors in its most recent annual securities filings published last year that its facilities were at risk from “accidents, fires, explosions and pollution” due to the nature of the hazardous and flammable materials it uses. It said accidents may leads to compensation claims, lawsuits and expensive delays in production.  Based in Colombes, France, Arkema has 133 facilities spread throughout 50 countries and employs 19,637 people worldwide. Arkema’s U.S. arm is headquartered in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, with 26 locations throughout the country. It has four other facilities in Texas besides Crosby: in Bayport, Beaumont, Clear Lake and Houston.  “This is a significant player,” said Mark Eramo, a vice president at financial services company IHS Markit. “A responsible operator that has unfortunately faced an unprecedented situation.”  Arkema makes adhesives that are used in everything from diapers to tiles and wallpaper, as well as chemicals for plastics in auto parts, clothing and eyeglasses. Its Crosby plant produces liquid organic peroxides found in food packaging and health and cleaning products. Thursday’s explosions was set in motion after Hurricane Harvey’s floodwaters knocked out power and backup generators, disabling the refrigeration needed to keep the organic peroxides stable.  Arkema was initially spun off from French energy giant Total in 2004. It separated to become a publicly traded company in 2006. Thierry Le Henaff has been CEO since it was founded.  The company’s revenue has held steady over the last few years, reaching $7.54 billion euros ($8.9 billion) in 2016. For comparison, its peer DuPont recorded $24.6 billion in revenue and Dow Chemical recorded $48.16 billion in the same year.  Arkema claims to be the world’s third-largest producer of hydrogen peroxide, which can be used for pharmaceuticals, bleaching textiles and treating wastewater.  The company lists 57 employees at its Crosby plant. A link on its website, last updated in 2015, says that Arkema dedicated $700,000 in approved capital investments for health, safety and environmental projects at the Crosby location. And under its safety record, it lists “One lost time injury in the last 7 years.”",5.0,1,[5.0]

(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert)  The Houston that was battered by Hurricane Harvey is an economic powerhouse whose influence reaches far beyond its region, leading many to worry about when its economy be able to stand up again.  Houston produces the plastic used in everything from sports cars to baby bottles and is part of a low-lying coastal region that supplies nearly a third of U.S. oil-refining capacity. As the fourth-largest U.S. city, with 2.3 million people, it is also headquarters for 20 Fortune 500 companies.  “There’s nothing being sold, nothing being manufactured and nothing being shipped in a city with a $500 billion economy,” says Patrick Jankowski, an economist with the Greater Houston Partnership, which promotes regional economic development. “Nothing is happening in Houston except rescues and people watching people get rescued.”  The following message will be displayed to users with unsupported browsers: Your browser does not support the iframe HTML tag. Try viewing this in a modern browser like Chrome, Safari, Firefox or Internet Explorer 9 or later.  “Greater Houston is a major engine of the U.S. economy,” IHS Markit says. Its port is the second-busiest in the United States. Its two airports handle 26 million passengers a year. And its world-class cancer center processes 13,000 cases a week, many of them booked by patients flying in from abroad.  If it were an independent country, Houston would boast the world’s 23rd-biggest economy, just below Sweden and just above Poland.  Forecasters aren’t yet sure exactly how high the economic damage will go, how far it will spread or how long it will last. The more than 50 inches of rain that flooded Houston left much of the city underwater and its manufacturing base all but immobilized.  Transportation — for residents, employees and businesses — is snarled. Houstonians are trapped in their homes or in shelters, unable to get around because the roads are flooded. The Port of Houston is closed, and flights are still limited at Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport.  Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm, calculates that economic damage from Hurricane Harvey could shave between 0.3 and 1.2 percentage points off the nation’s economic growth in the July-September quarter. Before the storm, the economy had been expected to grow at an annual rate of about 3 percent from July through September.  “The nation is going to find out how important Houston is to the rest of the economy,” Jankowski says “The dashboard in a Ford manufactured in Michigan or the plastic valve made in Indiana or the piece of costume jewelry in Rhode Island or a case for your computer in California — if it has plastic in it, it’s highly likely the plastic originated in Houston.”  Still, analysts note that the economic losses inflicted by Harvey are likely to be recouped once Houston’s rebuilding begins. And some sectors of the area’s economic base may have been less damaged that initially feared.  Robert Gilmer, director of the University of Houston’s Institute for Regional Forecasting, notes, for example, that the area’s refineries and petrochemical plants mostly escaped serious damage and are likely to be running again within weeks. He says authorities shut them down largely out of “abundance of caution. ... You realize that people just can’t get to work or that getting them to work is dangerous.”  The economic blow comes just as Houston was beginning to regain its footing after oil prices had tumbled into a freefall in mid-2014, bottoming just over $26 a barrel in January 2016, forcing cutbacks in the energy industry.  “Houston was just digging out and beginning to turn around,” says Edward Friedman, an economist at Moody’s Analytics. “Now it’s going to be down again for several months.”  Soon, though, insurance money and government aid will likely pour in, and building reconstruction and car purchases should help accelerate growth.  “Auto sales will go through the roof for a month or so” as Houstonians replace cars that were washed away or wrecked by the flooding, Gilmer predicts.  Harvey destroyed 1,000 homes in Texas and damaged an additional 50,000, leaving more than 30,000 people in shelters across the state. Roofers, electricians, carpenters and other construction workers will likely be busy building new houses and rewiring, repainting and ripping out and replacing moldy carpeting in old ones.  “There’s going to be 18 months’ worth of work here,” Gilmer predicts. That would be helpful for the city, which has lost 8,300 construction jobs over the past year and has an above-average unemployment rate — 4.9 percent, vs. 4.3 percent nationwide.  Gilmer says he thinks the Houston economy will enjoy a “short-lived burst of activity,” just as did when it hosted the 2004 Super Bowl and two 2005 World Series games and when it rebuilt after Hurricane Ike in 2008.  The economists at BBVA Research worry, though, that Harvey may leave long-term scars on the Houston economy. They write that “devastating weather events may force people to move out and deter both future investment and migration, thereby reducing economic potential.”  New Orleans is a cautionary tale: Twelve years after Hurricane Katrina’s destructive wallop, the Crescent City still has 7 percent fewer jobs than it had before.  But economist Jankowski, noting that Houston has endured oil busts and natural disasters before, said he was fairly confident in the city’s ability to rebound.  “If $26 oil doesn’t do us in,” he says, “52 inches of rain won’t either.”",4.5,1,[4.5]

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)  WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House is still trying to decide who will get President Donald Trump’s pledged $1 million donation for Harvey storm relief efforts, one of the largest gifts ever given by a president but one that has evoked his checkered charitable past.  The president plans to make the donation, which is expected to come from his personal fortune, early next week, and it may be split among several groups doing relief work in storm-ravaged areas of Texas and Louisiana. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Friday that the president hasn’t finalized where the money will go, raising some concern that charitable groups may end up competing for the money.  For the second straight day, Sanders invited reporters to make recommendations for which groups should get the money.  “If you have suggestions, he is very open to hearing those,” Sanders said.  The president met with three relief groups — the Red Cross, Southern Baptist Relief and Salvation Army — in the Oval Office on Friday and pledged the nation’s support to those affected by Harvey.  “Families have given food and shelter to those in need. Houses of worship have organized efforts to clean up communities and repair damaged homes,” Trump said during an earlier meeting with religious leaders. “People have never seen anything quite like this. Individuals of every background are striving for the same goal: to aid and comfort people facing devastating losses.”  Trump traveled to Texas on Tuesday and is scheduled to return Saturday to meet with storm survivors and inspect some of the destruction.  There has been some concern that, if Trump opted to donate to only one group or just a few, there could be intense competition among relief agencies for the money and the publicity that comes with it.  But Rick Cohen, communications director for the National Council of Nonprofits, said there’s already intense competition among organizations for Harvey donations.  “He should be looking to make an informed contribution, and it seems that he’s doing so,” said Cohen, noting that the president has stayed abreast of conditions on the ground and is planning to see it first-hand.  White House officials said the donation would come from the president’s personal fortune and not his business, the Trump Organization, or his charitable foundation.  “You have to take him at his word,” said Leslie Lenkowsky, a professor at Indiana University who focuses on philanthropy and who formerly headed the Corporation for National and Community Service. “If he wants to lead the way, that’s one of the things that a president’s supposed to do. ... He does like the image of himself as a compassionate person.”  Trump’s history of charitable donations features bursts of generosity frequently overshadowed by failed promises and questions about the source of the gifts.  The president has claimed to be worth $10 billion while experts have pegged his fortunate at far less. But Trump reportedly donates a far smaller percentage of his dollars than many of his fellow billionaires. The exact extent of Trump’s charitable giving is not known since the president has broken with decades of tradition and not released his tax returns.  The Trump Foundation came under heavy scrutiny during the 2016 presidential campaign. It was revealed that Trump frequently did not follow through on his charitable promises. Records show that in the 15 years before his campaign, Trump made $8.5 million in pledges but paid out about $2.8 million, according to The Washington Post.  In January 2016, Trump held a high-profile fundraiser for veterans’ causes, but it took him four months — and pressure from the media — to follow through on his pledge to donate $1 million of his own money to the cause.  Trump, one of the nation’s wealthiest presidents, has also pledged to donate his annual $400,000 salary to charity. His first two gifts from his presidential earnings were to the National Park Service and the Education Department.  Other presidents, including Barack Obama, would customarily donate a percentage of their income — including money from outside sources like book sales — to charity every year.  ___  Lemire reported from New York.",3.5,1,[3.5]
47,251,9,1,2017,2017-09-01,Associated Press News,AP Exclusive: Fewer Americans buy insurance in coastal areas,"Business analyst Amanda Spartz poses for a photo Thursday, Aug. 31, 2017, in Plantation, Fla. Far fewer Americans are buying flood insurance in coastal areas of the United States where the threat is serious from hurricanes, storms and tidal surges, according to the latest government data. Spartz decided to keep the flood insurance on her home after seeing the devastation Hurricane Harvey did to Houston. (AP Photo/Terry Spencer)  PLANTATION, Fla. (AP) — Amanda Spartz nearly did not renew her home’s flood insurance policy after her first year in Florida. Two hurricanes came close to the Fort Lauderdale suburbs last year, but they didn’t hit and her home isn’t in a high-risk flood zone. She figured she could put the $450 annual premium, due next week, to another use.  Then Harvey hit Houston, its historic rains causing massive floods even in low-risk neighborhoods. Spartz, a business analyst, paid the bill this week.  If Spartz had dropped her policy, she would not have been alone. Far fewer Americans compared with five years ago are paying for flood insurance in coastal areas of the United States where hurricanes, storms and tidal surges pose a serious threat, according to an Associated Press analysis of government data. The center for the problem is South Florida, where Spartz lives. The top U.S. official overseeing the National Flood Insurance Program told AP that he wants to double the number of Americans who buy flood insurance.  “I was talking to my husband and I said that if something like Harvey happens here, I don’t want to be on the hook,” said Spartz, who relocated from Cincinnati. “It isn’t a lot of money to save yourself the heartache if it does happen.”  What’s driving the drop in policies? Congress approved a price hike, making premiums more expensive, and maps of some high-risk areas were redrawn. Banks became lax at enforcing the requirement that any home with a federally insured mortgage in a high-risk area be covered. Memories of New Orleans underwater in 2005 after Hurricane Katrina have faded.  Without flood insurance, storm victims would have to draw on savings or go into debt — or perhaps be forced to sell.  The number of policies in force today has fallen in 43 of the 50 states since 2012, dropping from almost 5.5 million to just under 5 million, a decrease of 10 percent, AP’s analysis found. In low-lying Florida, where by far more flood insurance policies are sold than in any other state, the drop has been almost 16 percent. In only two states — Hawaii and South Carolina — are at least 50 percent of homes in flood hazard areas insured under the program.  AP’s analysis also showed the percentage of homes in high-risks areas that have flood insurance is sometimes frighteningly low. In Spartz’s home of Broward County, it’s only 13 percent. In Houston’s Harris County, it’s 28 percent. In New Orleans, it’s 46 percent.  Roy Wright, the director of the insurance program, which is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, acknowledges that the decrease is alarming and says he hopes to double the number of policies in the near future. He also wants to persuade more communities to limit construction in high-risk flood zones. Congress is likely to reauthorize the insurance program before it expires Sept. 30.  President Donald Trump’s homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, said he expects changes to the flood program to be debated on Capitol Hill later this fall, after the immediate Houston recovery is underway.  “This administration’s been pretty clear that we’d like to see some responsible reforms to the National Flood Insurance Program,” he said Thursday at the White House. “I don’t think now’s the time to debate those things.”  Last year, the program collected about $3.3 billion in premiums and paid out about $3.7 billion for losses. FEMA paid out $3.5 billion per year over the past 12 years, which included Katrina.  “It is about consumer choice. It’s about consumer education. It’s about an education related to flood risk. It’s about communities galvanizing around it. It’s also about communities making choices about how they want to build going into the future so that people are at less risk. When they are at less risk, their premiums are cheaper,” Wright told the AP.  One way to compel more homeowners to buy policies would be for banks to enforce the coverage requirement for homeowners with a federally insured mortgage if they live in a Special Flood Hazard Area. Experts said that’s not happening. Many homeowners let the policy lapse after a few years, correctly thinking the bank will not check. Or a bank will sell mortgages to another bank, and paperwork on whether homes require flood insurance isn’t reviewed. About 7 out of 10 homeowners have a mortgage.  “The banks are not watching the hen house,” said Loretta Worters, a spokeswoman with the Insurance Information Institute. “They sell these mortgages from a bank to another bank and to another bank, and whether that home needs flood insurance slips through the cracks.”  In Mississippi, the number of federally insured properties fell by nearly 15 percent, from about 75,000 in 2012 to 64,000 this year. The decreases were even higher in some coastal communities, including Gulfport and Long Beach — cities that took a direct hit from Katrina.  Ned Dolese, president and co-founder of Gulfport-based Coastal American Insurance Co., suspects the drop in Mississippi is largely due to a lack of government enforcement.  “There are no teeth in FEMA or the NFIP to whack you over the head if you, the consumer, don’t renew your flood policy,” he said.  FEMA periodically redraws flood-risk maps, moving some homes from mandatory-carry areas to a less-risky category. When the requirement is lifted, homeowners gamble or believe their home is no longer in danger. As Harvey proved, a lower-risk neighborhood is not a no-risk neighborhood.  After the city of Central, Louisiana, successfully petitioned FEMA last year to change its flood maps, it sent letters notifying roughly 2,000 residents that their homes no longer were inside the high-risk zone. Kyle Cutrer didn’t get flood insurance when he purchased a house in Central last summer, outside the flood zone.  Last August, a slow-moving storm dumped an estimated 7 trillion gallons of rainwater on south Louisiana, more than two feet of rain in some places. The deluge overtopped rivers and damaged or destroyed tens of thousands of homes, inundating many neighborhoods that had never seen such catastrophic flooding.  A foot of water washed into Cutrer’s home, causing approximately $40,000 in damage. He used about $16,000 from FEMA to pay for some repairs; he paid the rest himself.  Cutrer said his real-estate agent and mortgage company had both assured him he did not need flood insurance, which would have cost him about $300 annually.  “I was told, ‘You’ll never flood. You won’t have a problem here,’” he said. “As a first-time homebuyer, I was trying to keep that note as low as possible.”  A week after the flood, he called his insurance agent and purchased a flood policy.  “I’m not going to be able to stop the flood. But if it comes, I’ll be fine,” he said.  ___  Hoyer reported from Washington, and Kunzelman reported from Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

Gasoline prices in the U.S. have risen to new high amid continuing fears of shortages in Texas and other states after Hurricane Harvey's strike. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)  DALLAS (AP) — The spike in gasoline prices in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey has hit the accelerator.  The national average for regular was $2.56 a gallon by late Friday afternoon, an increase of 20 cents in the last week, according to GasBuddy.  Prices jumped at least 10 cents a gallon in 24 hours in Texas, Ohio, Georgia and the Mid-Atlantic states, travel club AAA reported.  The nationwide average was already higher than most experts had given as a worst-case scenario when flooding from the devastating storm began knocking out refineries along the Texas Gulf Coast a week ago.  Two of the leading price-forecasting analysts, GasBuddy’s Patrick DeHaan and Tom Kloza of the Oil Price Information Service, now see the national average peaking as high as $2.75 a gallon in the next few days.  Many stations in the Dallas area were out of gas Friday, and those that had it were often charging more than $3 a gallon — and drawing long lines of desperate drivers.  Texas Gov. Greg Abbott tried to reassure drivers that there is plenty of gasoline.  “Don’t worry, we will not run out,” Abbott said, “and we will be back into our normal pattern before you know it.”  The analysts said interruptions in supply were isolated and lines were largely the result of people rushing out to top off their tanks. DeHaan said only one rack, or wholesale gasoline terminal, out of the six in the Dallas area was dry.  “There is enough gas out there,” he said. “It’s just a matter of getting it to the right places before motorists panic.”  Valero Energy, a major refiner for the Texas market, said it was shipping only slightly reduced volumes to major cities in the state, although deliveries in Houston were still hampered by flooding.  Long lines could pop up next in the Southeastern and Eastern states, as far north as New York, which get much of their gasoline from the Colonial Pipeline that taps into refineries in Texas and Louisiana. The operator doesn’t expect the pipeline to resume normal operations until Sunday. On top of that, analysts said some gasoline from the Northeast is being diverted to Florida, and gasoline exports are contributing to the higher prices.  The U.S. now exports large amounts of gasoline, especially to Mexico and other parts of Latin America, and buyers there are competing with domestic distributors and bidding up prices.  How long this lasts will depend on how quickly the Gulf Coast refineries are back in business, especially the giants like Motiva’s Port Arthur, Texas, plant and the Exxon Mobil refinery in Baytown, near Houston.  One Chevron station in downtown Dallas that was selling regular for $2.29 a gallon before Harvey bumped up its price to $2.99 on Thursday, and a nearby Shell station was asking $3.97.  QuikTrip, one of the nation’s largest convenience store chains, temporarily halted gasoline sales at about half its 135 stores in the Dallas-Fort Worth area to send the fuel to a few designated stores across the area, said company spokesman Mike Thornbrugh.  Ten Texas refineries remained shut down Friday and another 10 were running at reduced rates or restarting, according to the Energy Department. About 4 million barrels per day of refining capacity was shut down — more than one-fifth of the nation’s supply. Some of that supply is expected to return within a week.  Spiro Dounis, an energy analyst with UBS, said it could take three months for the industry to produce at normal rates based on the experience after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.  ___  Paul Weber in Austin, Texas, and Claudia Lauer in Dallas contributed to this report.",4.5,1,[4.5]

Auto industry experts estimate that 500,000 to 1 million cars, trucks and SUVs were damaged by floodwaters from Hurricane Harvey. Most will have so much water damage that they can’t be fixed, and insurance companies will declare them total losses. Yet the damaged cars could be retitled and sold to unsuspecting buyers nationwide. Experts warn against buying the cars because damage could be hidden for years before causing problems. (AP Photo/David J. Phillip, File)  DETROIT (AP) — As Harvey moved away from Southeast Texas, aerial photos revealed thousands of cars covered by floodwaters on streets, parking lots and in driveways.  By the time the water recedes, auto industry experts estimate that 500,000 to 1 million vehicles will have been damaged by water, with most being total losses.  State Farm, one of the largest U.S. auto insurers, says it has already received almost 20,000 claims from the Houston area.  Cars sat in water for days, in many cases up to the windows or roof lines. It’s likely they’ll never be driven again.  Here are answers to questions about what will happen to those vehicles and how to handle your car in the aftermath of the epic storm.  Q: SHOULD I START MY CAR IF IT’S BEEN FLOODED?  A: No, in almost all cases. If the car was only in a few inches of water that didn’t rise past the bottom of the body, maybe. Water higher than that can get into wires, transmission parts, the exhaust or other places. Deeper water could enter the cylinders that surround the pistons. Trying to start the car could bend parts that connect the pistons to the rest of the drive train, said John Nielsen, managing director of automotive engineering for AAA. Oil, gasoline, antifreeze, brake fluid and other liquids could have water in them that could cause damage if not replaced. Nielsen recommends having the car towed to a mechanic for inspection. Depending on the severity of flood damage, he says the cost of refurbishing a car likely will be more than replacing it.  Q: IF IT’S REPAIRED, WILL MY CAR BE SAFE?  A: Probably not. Water could have damaged sensors, electrical connectors, computer chips and wiring that are under the carpet, behind the dashboard or in the engine compartment. That could disable lights, air bags, ignition, gas and brake pedal sensors or other essential systems. Corrosion can form beneath wiring insulation. Salty water from the Gulf of Mexico would make that worse. Damage may not surface for years. “Maybe it’s OK. Maybe it’s not. I would be really worried about it,” says Nielsen.  Q: WILL INSURANCE COVER A FLOODED CAR?  A: Depends on your coverage. If you’re financing or leasing, your lender likely requires comprehensive insurance, which typically covers flood damage along with fire, vandalism or falling objects. But if you own a car outright, or it’s old and would be more expensive to repair than it’s worth, you may choose not to get comprehensive coverage. As of 2013, 78 percent of U.S. insured drivers had comprehensive coverage, according to the Insurance Information Institute.  Q: HOW DO INSURERS HANDLE FLOODED CARS?  A: Once an owner files a claim, the insurer will evaluate the damage. Many states have guidelines for a vehicle to be considered a total loss, including the extent and type of damage and the cost of repair, says Missy Dundov, a spokeswoman for State Farm. If the insurer determines the vehicle is a total loss, it will pay the owner — minus a deductible that’s typically $500 to $1,000 — and take the vehicle and the title.  Q: WHERE DO FLOODED CARS GO?  A: Insurers will turn the cars over to auctions or salvage yards. Undamaged parts will be salvaged and many vehicles will be scrapped. Some will go to salvage auctions, says Tim West, vice president and North American auction director for Black Book, a service that calculates used car prices. Everything that’s ruled a total loss by an insurance company should get a salvage title. But consumers should be careful. A vehicle considered a total loss in one state might not require a salvage title in another state, says Ron Montoya, a senior consumer advice editor for Edmunds.com.  Q: HOW CAN I AVOID BUYING A FLOOD-DAMAGED VEHICLE?  A: Flooded cars could be shipped to other parts of the country or even other nations. To find out where the car came from and if it has a salvage title, experts suggest keying the vehicle identification number into services (there’s a charge) that search car histories such as Autocheck or Carfax. Carfax and the National Insurance Crime Bureau offer free services to check for flood damage. Buyers can ask to take the car to a mechanic for inspection. Buyers can also look for signs of flooding, including musty or moldy odors or overpowering use of air freshener, discolored carpet or new carpet in an old car, water lines in the engine compartment or trunk, fogging inside headlights or taillights, rust or flaking metal under the car, and dirt buildup in unusual areas such as around seat tracks. If you see any signs, don’t buy the car, AAA’s Nielsen says. “You’re liable to face gremlins with that car forever,” he said.  ___  ___  Sign up for AP’s newsletter showcasing our best all-formats reporting on Harvey and its aftermath: http://apne.ws/ahYQGtb .",5.0,1,[5.0]

Officials say nearly all Houston-area waterways inundated by Harvey's record rainfall have crested, but that water levels continue to rise in two flood-control reservoirs. (Michael Ciaglo /Houston Chronicle via AP)  NEW YORK (AP) — The recovery from Harvey will be long and expensive. Want to help? Local and national charities are asking for donations after the Hurricane Texas and Louisiana, leaving countless residents — and pets — displaced from their homes.  While the urge to donate clothes and other supplies is natural, money is the best way to contribute during times of disaster, charities and philanthropy experts say. And donating directly through a website gets money to a charity faster than a text donation, even though the text might seem easier.  Here’s how to make sure you are giving in a way that matters the most.  ___  GIVE TO ESTABLISHED RELIEF AGENCIES  GuideStar’s website has a database that lets you vet charities .  Stacy Palmer, editor of The Chronicle of Philanthropy, also suggests looking through local news reports for information on a charity’s work, or contacting the local United Way and the local Community Foundation — in this case Houston’s.  It’s up to you whether to go with a local charity that might know the area better, or a national charity that has wider reach. Palmer says “both kinds of organizations have their place right now.”  ___  TEXTING TO GIVE?  It might be tempting to make a donation through text and have the phone company charge it on your phone bill. But Palmer says charities have to wait for phone companies to release the money. It’s quicker if you go to the charity’s website and donate directly, using a credit or debit card.  That said, relief agencies will need money beyond first few days or even weeks, so if the ease of text donations appeals to you, tap away. To donate $10 to the Red Cross via text, send a text message saying “REDCROSS” to the number 90999.  Apple users in the U.S. can also donate to the American Red Cross through the company’s iTunes and app stores.  ___  TIMING  Donations often pour in immediately after disaster strikes but peter out during the long recovery process. While there are a lot of immediate needs, Palmer says, “charities are going to need support on the long haul.”  Consider saving some of your money so you can donate again in a few weeks or months. Better yet, set up a recurring donation to support your chosen charity over time.  Some charities will say when they have raised enough for a particular disaster and use any extra money for their general fund, Palmer says. This isn’t bad.  “One of the things this disaster shows is that it’s important to have resilience,” she says. “It’s smart to just give and say that it can be used wherever it’s most needed.”  ___  CROWDFUNDING  Group fundraising services such as GoFundMe let people raise money for friends, families, neighbors or themselves — as well as for charity. As always, do your homework before giving to a stranger or cause online.  GoFundMe has a special page for Hurricane Harvey pleas for charities, individuals and families. GlobalGiving, a crowdfunding site for charities, is trying to raise $2 million for local relief and recovery efforts.  Remember that donations are tax-deductible only if they go to a registered non-profit or charity. Otherwise, they are generally considered gifts.  ___  HOLD OFF ON MATERIAL DONATIONS  Donating food, clothing and household items can complicate and even hinder relief efforts, experts say. The U.S. Center for Disaster Information says unsolicited goods are “never required in early stages of response, and they compete with priority relief items for transportation and storage.”  It doesn’t mean there will never be a time or place for such donations — check with relief agencies as time passes. And a few charities have announced immediate needs for material donations; the Houston Humane Society has set up an Amazon wish list for the most needed items.  ___  SERVICES  Consider volunteering or opening your homes to displaced families and emergency workers. Airbnb is waiving service fees and a requirement that hosts charge at least $10 a night; free accommodations are permitted in selected area.  Facebook’s “Community Help” feature lets people offer and ask for help, such as food, supplies, shelter and rides. To browse what people are asking for, go the “explore” tab on your Facebook site or on the mobile app. Then, click on “Safety Check,” where you will see a section for Hurricane Harvey . On Friday afternoon, people were asking for everything from volunteers to shelter, baby supplies and food.  ___  CONSIDER SPECIAL NEEDS  Consider charities that focus on vulnerable populations, such as seniors, the disabled, children and even pets.  The Texas Diaper Bank says diapers (whether for babies or adults) are not provided by disaster relief agencies. Again, these charities need money — not boxes of diapers you picked up at Costco.  Save The Children is setting up “child-friendly spaces” inside shelters to give kids a safe area to play, get support from trained experts and “get a sense of normalcy” during disasters, spokeswoman Jordyn Linsk said. The organization is also distributing infant and toddler supplies.  Portlight Strategies helps people with disabilities, older adults and their families recover after disasters.  To help animals, check the San Antonio Humane Society, which has set up an emergency fund for pets and strays, or the Houston Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals . And the Houston Humane Society needs money, too.  Local charities such as the Houston Food Bank and the LGBTQ Disaster Relief fund (managed by Houston’s Montrose Center) are also asking for help.  ___  RELIGIOUS AND HUMANITARIAN GROUPS  Some of the religious organizations are “some of the strongest relief groups,” Palmer says.  Those accepting donations include Catholic Charities USA, International Orthodox Christian Charities , World Vision , Islamic Relief USA , the Jewish Federations of North America and Tzu Chi USA , a humanitarian organization with Buddhist roots.",4.5,1,[4.5]

Floodwaters have inundated at least five highly contaminated toxic waste sites near Houston, raising concerns that the pollution there might spread. (AP Photo/Jason Dearen)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Sunday he expects the Environmental Protection Agency “to get on top” of the threat of possible water contamination after an Associated Press report of highly toxic waste sites flooded in the Houston area.  “The EPA is monitoring that. The EPA is going to get on top of that,” said Abbott, when asked on “Fox News Sunday” whether toxic floodwaters could pose a continuing health threat to Texas residents.  “We are working with the EPA to make sure that we contain any of these chemicals harming anybody in the greater Houston area or any other place,” he said.  The Houston metropolitan area is home to more than a dozen Superfund sites, designated by the EPA as being among America’s most intensely contaminated places. The AP surveyed seven of them and reported Saturday that all had been inundated with water, in some cases many feet deep, raising the concern that floodwaters may wash in pollution.  An EPA statement later confirmed the AP’s reporting that the federal agency had not yet been able to physically visit the Houston-area sites, saying the sites had “not been accessible by response personnel.” EPA staff had checked on two Superfund sites in Corpus Christi on Thursday and found no significant damage.  On Sunday, Abbott said there will always be a threat of contaminated water whenever there is a flood situation.  “What people need to do is they just need to be very cautious in the way they respond,” he said. “Do things like wear gloves, wear a mask, wear clothing so that your skin is not going to brush up against what you’re cleaning.”  Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said he was comfortable with the safety of Houston’s drinking water, saying the Superfund sites were outside the city.  “Certainly, we would hope that the EPA would be on the ground now to take a look at those Superfund sites, to make sure that contamination is contained and limited,” he said.  Abbott appeared on Fox and CNN’s “State of the Union,” while Turner spoke on NBC’s “Meet the Press” and CBS’ “Face the Nation.”",4.5,1,[4.5]

(Wu Hong/Pool Photo via AP)  XIAMEN, China (AP) — Five major emerging economies opened a summit Monday to map out their future course, with host Chinese President Xi Jinping calling on them to play a bigger role in world governance, reject protectionism and inject new energy into tackling the gap between the world’s wealthy and developing nations.  “We need to make the international order more just and equitable,” he told the leaders of Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa in his opening address. “Our ever closer ties with the rest of the world require that our five countries play a more active role in world governance. Without us, ... many challenges cannot be effectively resolved.”  Xi said they should “speak with one voice” to jointly present their solutions to global problems and safeguard their common interests.  He also called on his BRICS partners, Brazilian President Michel Temer, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and South African President Jacob Zuma to oppose a growing tide of protectionism across the world. The leaders are holding their annual summit in the southeastern Chinese city of Xiamen through Tuesday.  BRICS was formed as an association of fast-growing large economies about a decade ago to advocate for better representation for developing countries and challenge the Western-dominated world order that has prevailed since the end of World War II. It soon achieved agreement to increase the share of voting rights for emerging markets in world financial bodies the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. It has also started operating its own development bank.  Xi wants BRICS to play a more important role in international affairs, even as some observers suggest its power is waning given rivalry between China and India and the economic woes of Brazil, Russia and South Africa.  “BRICS country cooperation is not a talking shop but a task force that gets things done,” Xi said in a speech to BRICS business leaders Sunday. “Our goal is to build a big market of trade and investment, promote smooth flow of currency and finance, improve connectivity of infrastructure and build close bonds between the peoples.”  The five nations all broadly support free trade and oppose protectionism, although China in particular has been accused of erecting barriers to foreign competition as its own companies buy up others overseas. But Xi has positioned himself as a champion of globalization at a time when his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump is renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement and pulled the U.S. out of a planned trade deal with Pacific nations.  Yet clear political and economic differences exist among the BRICS countries. They range from democratic to autocratic, with some maintaining heavy government control over the economy and civil society. And the economies of Brazil, Russia and South Africa are driven largely by raw material exports and have been hit by slumping commodity prices, while China and India are oriented more toward manufacturing and services.  Trade within BRICS is also heavily in favor of China, the world’s second-largest economy and a key driver of sustained world economic growth.  Suggesting disagreements lie ahead in Xiamen, South African President Jacob Zuma said that despite a doubling of his nation’s trade with BRICS countries from $15 billion in 2010 to $31.2 billion in 2016, it had been “inequitable.”  “The character of trade has been highly inequitable,” he said in remarks to the BRICS Business Council on Sunday. “Exports from South Africa have been driven particularly by raw materials. This dominance of raw material exports has adversely impacted South Africa.”  He called on the other BRICS nations to invest in supply and development programs in Africa and skills development and technology transfer, and engage in projects “that would support inclusive development and equal partnerships.”  He also called on the New Development Bank, which was created by BRICS in 2014 and started operating last year, to lend more to Africa.  Xi told the other leaders on Monday that they had “yet to fully tap the potential of BRICS cooperation.”  Of the $197 billion outbound investment made by BRICS in 2016, only 5.7 percent was within the five countries, he said, calling for more cooperation in finance, connectivity, sustainable development, innovation and industrial cooperation.  A meeting between Xi and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is due to take place Tuesday. Last week, the two hurriedly concluded a 10-week border stand-off over disputed land in the Himalayas, which was their most serious confrontation in decades, to smooth the way for Modi’s participation in the summit. The two greeted each other smiling and with a firm handshake at Monday’s welcoming ceremony.  Some observers say admitting other countries to BRICS would answer some of its problems. While no formal progress is expected on that at this summit, China has invited the leaders of Egypt, Guinea, Mexico, Tajikistan and Thailand to attend a dialogue with the BRICS’ presidents and prime ministers on Tuesday.  On Sunday, Xi met on the sidelines with Russian President Vladimir Putin and discussed North Korea’s latest nuclear test — its sixth and most powerful yet, which has cast a shadow over the summit hosted by Pyongyang’s only major ally, China. The official Xinhua News Agency said they agreed to “appropriately deal with” it, without elaborating.  Putin also spoke to Japanese leader Shinzo Abe by phone after arriving in Xiamen on Sunday, and urged restraint in responding to North Korea’s claim to have set off a hydrogen bomb test, according to a Kremlin spokesman.  Xinhua also reported that Xi and Putin had agreed to enhance military cooperation between China and Russia.  ___  Follow Louise Watt on Twitter at twitter.com/louise_watt",2.0,2,"[2.5, 1.5]"
63,336,9,4,2017,2017-09-04,Associated Press News,San Francisco official pushes robot tax to battle automation,"In this Monday, June 26, 2017, photo, Sophie Li, of Cupertino, Calif., offers to dance with a K5 robot made by Knightscope, Inc., at Westfield Valley Fair shopping center in San Jose, Calif. In the technology hotbed that stretches from San Francisco to San Jose, people can eat a pizza made largely by a robot, have hotel toiletries delivered by a robot, drink a frothy cappuccino made by a robot and shop at a mall with robot security. Now, one prominent San Francisco official is calling for a tax on companies that automate jobs once held by people. (AP Photo/Ben Margot)  SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Security guard Eric Leon watches the Knightscope K5 security robot as it glides through the mall, charming shoppers with its blinking blue and white lights. The brawny automaton records video and sounds alerts. According to its maker, it deters mischief just by making the rounds.  Leon, the all-too-human guard, feels pretty sure that the robot will someday take his job.  “He doesn’t complain,” Leon says. “He’s quiet. No lunch break. He’s starting exactly at 10.”  Even in the technology hotbed stretching from Silicon Valley to San Francisco, a security robot can captivate passers-by. But the K5 is only one of a growing menagerie of automated novelties in a region where you can eat a delivered pizza made via automation and drink beers at a bar served by an airborne robot. This summer, the San Francisco Chronicle published a tech tourism guide listing a dozen or so places where tourists can observe robots and automation in action.  Yet, San Francisco is also where workers were the first to embrace mandatory sick leave and fully paid parental leave. Voters approved a $15 hourly minimum wage in 2014, a requirement that Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law for the entire state in 2016. And now one official is pushing a statewide “tax” on robots that automate jobs and put people out of work.  San Francisco supervisor Jane Kim is proposing a so-called ""robot tax."" (AP Video)  It’s too soon to say if the effort will prevail, let alone whether less-progressive jurisdictions might follow suit. The tussle points to the tensions that can flare when people embrace both technological innovation and a strong brand of social consciousness.  Such frictions seem destined to escalate as automation makes further inroads into the workplace. One city supervisor, Norman Yee, has proposed barring food delivery robots from city streets, arguing that public sidewalks should be solely for people.  “I’m a people person,” Yee says, “so I tend to err on the side of things that should be beneficial and safe for people.”  Jane Kim, the city supervisor who is pushing the robot tax, says it’s important to think now about how people will earn a living as more U.S. jobs are lost to automation. After speaking with experts on the subject, she decided to launch a statewide campaign with the hope of bringing revenue-raising ideas to the state legislature or directly to voters.  “I really do think automation is going to be one of the biggest issues around income inequality,” Kim says.  It makes sense, she adds, that the city at the center of tech disruption take up the charge to manage that disruption.  “It’s not inherently a bad thing, but it will concentrate wealth, and it’s going to drive further inequity if you don’t prepare for it now,” she says.  “Preposterous” is what William Santana Li, CEO of security robot maker Knightscope calls the supervisor’s idea. His company created the K5 robot monitoring the Westfield Valley Fair mall in San Jose.  The private security industry, Li says, suffers from high turnover and low pay. As he sees it, having robots handle menial tasks allows human guards to assume greater responsibilities — like managing a platoon of K5 robots — and likely earn more pay in the process.  Li acknowledges that such jobs would require further training and some technological know-how. But he says people ultimately stand to benefit. Besides, Li says, it’s wrong to think that robots are intended to take people’s jobs.  “We’re working on 160 contracts right now, and I can maybe name two that are literally talking about, ‘How can I get rid of that particular human position?’”  The question of whether — or how quickly — workers will be displaced by automation ignites fierce debate. It’s enough to worry Bill Gates, who suggested in an interview early this year a robot tax as a way to slow the speed of automation and give people time to prepare. The Microsoft co-founder hasn’t spoken publicly about it since.  A report last year from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development concluded that 9 percent of jobs in the United States — or about 13 million — could be automated. Other economists argue that the impact will be much less drastic.  The spread of automation should also generate its own jobs, analysts say, offsetting some of those being eliminated. Workers will be needed, for example, to build and maintain robots and develop the software to run them.  Technological innovation has in the past created jobs in another way, too: Work involving new technologies is higher-skilled and typically higher-paying. Analysts say that much of the extra income those workers earn tends to be spent on additional goods and services, thereby creating more jobs.  “There are going to be a wider array of jobs that will support the automation economy,” said J.P. Gownder, an analyst at the research firm Forrester. “A lot of what we’re going to be doing is working side by side with robots.”  What about people who lose jobs to automation but can’t transition to more technologically demanding work?  Lawmakers in Hawaii have voted to explore the idea of a universal basic income to guarantee wages to servers, cooks and cleaners whose jobs may be replaced by machines. Kim, the San Francisco supervisor, is weighing the idea of using revenue from a robot tax to supplement the low wages of people whose jobs can’t be automated, like home health care aides.  Doug Bloch, political director of Teamsters Joint Council 7 in Northern California and northern Nevada, said there have been no mass layoffs among hotel, trucking or food service staff resulting from automation. But that day is coming, he warns.  Part of his responsibility is to make sure that union drivers receive severance and retraining if they lose work to automation.  “All the foundations are being built for this,” he says. “The table is being set for this banquet, and we want to make sure our members have a seat at the table.”  Tech companies insist their products will largely assist, and not displace, workers. Savioke, based in San Jose, makes 3-foot-tall (91 centimeter) robots — called Relay — that deliver room service at hotels where only one person might be on duty at night. This allows the clerk to stay at the front desk, said Tessa Lau, the company’s “chief robot whisperer.”  “We think of it as our robots taking over tasks but not taking over jobs,” Lau says. “If you think of a task as walking down a hall and waiting for an elevator, Relay’s really good at that.”  Similarly, friends Steve Simoni, Luke Allen and Gregory Jaworski hatched the idea of a drink-serving robot one night at a crowded bar in San Francisco. There was no table service. But there was a sea of thirsty people.  “We all wanted another round, but you have to send someone to leave the conversation and wait in line at the bar for 10 minutes and carry all the drinks back,” Allen says.  They created the Bbot, a box that slides overhead on a fixed route at the Folsom Street Foundry in San Francisco, bringing drinks ordered by smartphone and poured by a bartender — who still receives a tip. The bar is in Kim’s district in the South of Market neighborhood.  Simoni says the company is small and it couldn’t shoulder a government tax. But he’s glad policy makers are preparing for a future with more robots and automation.  “I don’t know if we need to tax companies for it, but I think it’s an important debate,” he says.  As for his trio, he says: “We’re going to side with innovation every time. Innovation is what moves the world forward.”  ___  AP Writer Christopher Rugaber in Washington contributed to this report.  ___  Stories in the AP’s Future of Work series are available here: https://apnews.com/tag/FutureofWork",3.5,1,[3.5]
75,385,9,5,2017,2017-09-05,Associated Press News,"Publisher Tronc acquires Daily News, storied NY tabloid"," Newspaper publisher Tronc has acquired the Daily News, a storied New York tabloid newspaper that won a Pulitzer Prize this year but has been buffeted by the changing media environment.  Chicago-based Tronc Inc., the publisher of the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune, announced the deal Monday night, and the Daily News posted a story on its website. It was first reported by The New York Times.  Tronc CEO Justin Dearborn said acquiring the paper and its popular website would “provide us with another strategic platform for growing our digital business, expanding our reach and broadening our services for advertisers and marketers,” and both Tronc and Daily News executives said the company would maintain the quality of the paper’s journalism.  “Over the past near-century, the New York Daily News has served New York City and its surrounding areas with its award-winning journalism and helped shape the dynamics of the city,” News owner Mort Zuckerman said in a release. A New York real estate magnate, he had owned the paper since 1993.  The deal puts the Daily News under the umbrella of one of the nation’s major newspaper chains, with properties spanning from the Hartford Courant in Connecticut to the Sun-Sentinel in South Florida.  Tronc — which evolved from Daily News founder the Tribune Co. — gets a presence in the New York media market, a news site with about 25 million unique monthly visitors and other assets. Under the terms of the deal, Tronc said it assumed the Daily News’ operational and pension liabilities and got 100 percent ownership of its Jersey City, New Jersey, printing plant and a 49.9 percent interest in the plant’s 25-acre (10-hectare) property, which overlooks the Manhattan skyline.  With the deal, News Editor-in-Chief Arthur Browne was also named publisher, though he plans to retire at the end of the year.  Founded in 1919, the Daily News considers itself “New York’s Hometown Newspaper,” informing everyday New Yorkers about their city and more. It has been known over the years for zesty headlines — perhaps most notably “Ford to City: Drop Dead” during the New York’s financial woes in 1975 — gossip, city coverage and star columnists that included Jimmy Breslin, Pete Hamill and Liz Smith.  Lately, the tabloid has also attracted attention with its unsparing criticism of President Donald Trump. (Trump, in return, branded the paper “worthless” and Zuckerman “dopey” in tweets last year.)  The Daily News and ProPublica together won this year’s Pulitzer Prize in public service journalism for uncovering how authorities used an obscure law to evict hundreds of people, mostly poor minorities, from their homes. It was the Daily News’ 11th Pulitzer Prize, and the fifth during Zuckerman’s tenure.  But the paper has also contended with the shifts in news consumption and advertising that have affected newspapers in general in the digital age. The newspaper industry has been suffering for years from declining print circulation and advertising revenue, as readership and ad dollars have shifted online. Online ad sales have increased for newspaper companies, but not always enough to offset the decline in print revenue.  The Daily News also grappled with a muscular hometown tabloid rival, the News Corp.-owned New York Post.  Zuckerman eyed selling the Daily News in 2015 but ultimately took it off the market.",4.5,1,[4.5]
76,386,9,4,2017,2017-09-04,Associated Press News,Trump’s DACA plan would pass hot potato to Congress,"Supporters of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, chant slogans and holds signs while joining a Labor Day rally in downtown Los Angeles on Monday, Sept. 4, 2017. President Donald Trump is expected to announce this week that he will end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, but with a six-month delay, according to two people familiar with the decision-making. (AP Photo/Richard Vogel)  WASHINGTON (AP) — A plan President Donald Trump is expected to announce Tuesday for young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children was embraced by some top Republicans on Monday and denounced by others as the beginning of a “civil war” within the party.  The response was an immediate illustration of the potential battles ahead if Trump follows through with a plan that would hand a political hot potato to Republicans on the Hill who have a long history of dropping it.  Two people familiar with his decision making said Sunday that Trump was preparing to announce an end to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA program, but with a six-month delay intended to give Congress time to pass legislation that would address the status of the hundreds of thousands of immigrants covered by the program.  The move comes after a long and notably public deliberation. Despite campaigning as an immigration hard-liner, Trump has said he is sympathetic to the plight of the immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally as children and in some cases have no memories of the countries they were born in.  But such an approach — essentially kicking the can down the road and letting Congress deal with it— is fraught with uncertainty and political perils that amount, according to one vocal opponent, to “Republican suicide.”  Still other Republicans say they are ready to take on a topic that has proven a non-starter and career-breaker for decades.  “If President Trump makes this decision we will work to find a legislative solution to their dilemma,” said Republican Sen. Lindsay Graham.  Officials caution Trump’s plan, set to be unveiled Tuesday, is not yet finalized, and the president, who has been grappling with the issue for months, has been known to change his mind at the last minute ahead of an announcement. It also remains unclear exactly how a six-month delay would work in practice, including whether the government would continue to process applications under the program, which has given nearly 800,000 young immigrants a reprieve from deportation and the ability to work legally in the country in the form of two-year, renewable permits.  House Speaker Paul Ryan and a handful of other Republicans urged Trump last week to hold off on scrapping DACA to give lawmakers time to come up with a legislative fix.  But Congress has repeatedly tried — and failed — to come together on immigration overhaul legislation, and it remains uncertain whether the House would succeed in passing anything on the divisive topic.  The House under Democratic control passed a Dream Act in 2010, but it died in the Senate. Since Republicans retook control of the House in late 2010, it has taken an increasingly hard line on immigration. House Republicans refused to act on the Senate’s comprehensive immigration bill in 2013. Two years later, a GOP border security bill languished because of objections from conservatives.  Many House Republicans represent highly conservative districts, and if the president goes through with the six-month delay — creating a March deadline — the pressure is likely to be amplified as primary races intensify head of the 2018 midterm elections.  One cautionary tale: the primary upset of former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor to a conservative challenger in 2014 in a campaign that cast him as soft on illegal immigration. That loss convinced many House Republicans that pro-immigrant stances could cost them politically.  The Obama administration created the DACA program in 2012 as a stopgap as they pushed unsuccessfully for a broader immigration overhaul in Congress. Many Republicans say they opposed the program on the grounds that it was executive overreach.  Legislation to legalize the so-called Dreamers has been lingering in Congress for years, with a handful of bills currently pending in the House and Senate.  The one that has received the most attention, introduced by Sens. Graham, R-S.C., and Dick Durbin, D-Ill., would grant permanent legal status to more than 1 million young people who arrived in the United States before they turned 18, passed security checks and met other criteria, including enrolling in college, joining the military or finding jobs.  It’s unclear, however, whether the president would throw his support behind that or any other existing legislation. He could encourage the writing of a new bill — tied, perhaps, to funding for his promised border wall or other concessions like a reduction in legal immigration levels. But it’s unclear how much political capital the president would want to put on the line given his base’s strong opposition to illegal immigration, his campaign rhetoric blasting DACA as illegal “amnesty” and his reluctance to campaign hard for other priorities, like health care overhaul.  Graham said in a statement Monday that he would support the president if he decided ultimately to go through with the plan as outlined.  “I have always believed DACA was a presidential overreach. However, I equally understand the plight of the Dream Act kids who -- for all practical purposes -- know no country other than America,” Graham said in a statement.  Sen. James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, agreed, saying that it should be up to Congress, not the White House, to set immigration policy.  “We must confront the nation’s out-of-date immigration policy and finally resolve the issues of strong border enforcement and merit immigration,” he said. “It is right for there to be consequences for those who intentionally entered this country illegally. However, we as Americans do not hold children legally accountable for the actions of their parents.”  But Rep. Steve King, an Iowa Republican who believes that DACA is unconstitutional, warned that pushing the decision to Congress would be a big mistake.  “That would cause a great big civil war among the Republicans,” he said last week. “We’ve got enough of never-Trumpers in Congress that are undermining the president’s agenda.”  “Ending DACA now gives chance 2 restore Rule of Law. Delaying so R Leadership can push Amnesty is Republican suicide,” he added on Twitter late Sunday night.  ___  Associated Press writers Catherine Lucey and Erica Werner contributed to this report.",3.5,1,[3.5]

Kohl's says it will open up Amazon shops in 10 of its stores, making it the latest department store operator to make a deal with the e-commerce giant. Kohl's Corp., based in Menomonee Falls, Wis., said Wednesday, Sept. 6, the Amazon shops will open next month in Chicago and Los Angeles stores.(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee)  NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon has long been blamed for the falling fortunes of department stores. Now, some of them are teaming up with the e-commerce giant.  Kohl’s said Wednesday that it will open Amazon shops in 10 of its department stores that will sell Amazon Echos, Fire tablets and other gadgets. The deal comes just a few months after the owner of Sears and Kmart said it would sell its Kenmore-branded appliances on Amazon.com for the first time.  The partnership gives Kohl’s a way to differentiate itself from rival department stores and lure in shoppers looking to buy electronics. For Amazon, it gets its devices in front of more people to touch and try them.  “It is a smart move for both companies,” analysts at Jeffries said. “They always say you should keep your enemies closer.”  Department stores have struggled as more people shop online or at discount stores. Kohl’s, Macy’s and Dillard’s all reported a drop in a key sales figure last month for their latest quarters.  But despite the growth of online shopping, most retail transactions still take place in physical stores — and Seattle-based Amazon.com Inc. doesn’t seem to want to miss out. It has opened 11 bookstores in two years and recently bought grocer Whole Foods, allowing it to sell the Amazon Echo voice-activated device next to organic grapes and corn in its more than 460 stores.  Kohl’s said it will open the 1,000-square-foot Amazon areas next month within its Chicago and Los Angeles stores. The companies did not provide financial details of the deal, but said the new sections will be staffed by Amazon employees. Shoppers will be able to hire a plumber or housekeeper through Amazon. And they can also have an Amazon employee come to their home and install a device or suggest smart home products to buy. Best Buy recently launched a similar program, which sends its employees to customer’s homes to recommend electronics.  Analysts at Citi said they hope Kohl’s can add more Amazon services in its stores, like package pickup or drop-off, which could give people a reason to go into Kohl’s stores more frequently. “Perhaps this could be that start of a broader partnership,” the Citi analysts said.  Shares of Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin-based Kohl’s Corp. soared 5 percent to close at $42.37 Wednesday.",1.5,1,[1.5]
86,484,9,6,2017,2017-09-06,Associated Press News,Trump’s harsh message to immigrants could drag on economy," James Harrison, the owner of a Phoenix-based specialty construction firm, employs three workers protected by an Obama-era immigration program that the Trump administration took steps Tuesday to eliminate .  Should those workers — who were brought to the United States illegally as children — be deported, Harrison doubts he would find other workers to replace them anytime soon.  “These are some of my top guys,” Harrison said. “They don’t drink, they don’t do drugs, they don’t do anything but work.”  His own grandfather, Harrison said, immigrated to the United States from England without any paperwork.  His on-the-ground viewpoint couldn’t be more different from that of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who made the questionable assertion Tuesday that the Obama administration’s measure “denied jobs to hundreds of thousands of Americans by allowing those same jobs to go to illegal aliens.”  Nearly all economists and most business leaders reject Sessions’ view. Ending the program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, won’t boost U.S. employment at a time when an aging workforce and a low jobless rate have left many employers struggling to find skilled workers. Eliminating the program might even cost jobs in the long run, they say.  The program allows immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children to stay in the United States, attend school and find jobs. Those who benefit are sometimes called “Dreamers,” after early proposals in Congress that never passed. President Barack Obama implemented the program in 2012.  The administration said the measure will phase out over six months, giving Congress an opportunity to approve a replacement plan.  More broadly, economists warn that eliminating DACA, along with other steps the Trump administration has taken, such as banning travel from several Muslim nations and proposing cuts to legal immigration, could inflict long-term damage on the economy. The proposals could discourage potential immigrants, including those with advanced degrees and skills, from entering the United States. Some immigrants already in the U.S. might refrain from starting businesses, analysts say.  “It says to immigrants in the United States that you have no certainty in this country,” said Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. “That will have economic impacts that will go well beyond the employment circumstances and prospects of the Dreamers themselves.”  Immigrants are generally more likely to start companies than are native-born Americans, Alden said. About 40 percent of Silicon Valley companies have had at least one immigrant founder.  Harrison’s company performs sand-blasting work that strips lead paint and mold. He was planning to leave for Houston to take part in recovery work from Hurricane Harvey.  Last week, Harrison signed a letter , along with about 400 other CEOs, urging the administration to preserve the DACA program. The letter says nearly three-quarters of the top 25 Fortune 500 companies employ some of the roughly 800,000 people protected by the measure.  Microsoft, which says it employs at least 39 beneficiaries of the program, urged Congress to approve legislation that would keep the policy before it takes up tax reform.  Studies have found that the economic damage caused by expelling those protected by the measure would be modest but noticeable. The libertarian Cato Institute estimated it would cost the U.S. economy $215 billion over 10 years, a small drop given that the nation’s output is roughly $17 trillion every year.  But most economists see immigration generally as an economic boon. That’s particularly true as the U.S. ages, which means more Americans are retiring. Those retirements have slowed the growth of the U.S. workforce — a trend that, in turn, limits the economy’s potential expansion.  The U.S. economy has expanded at a 2.2 percent annual rate since the Great Recession ended in 2009. President Donald Trump has said he wants to raise that pace to at least 3 percent.  “If you want to raise the economy’s underlying growth rate, we should be increasing immigration, not reducing it,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.  The Cato study notes that beneficiaries of DACA are similar to the highly-skilled immigrants who are granted H-1B visas to work in the United States. The average beneficiary is 22, has a job, and earns about $34,000 a year, Cato says.  Nearly three-fifths reported finding work after the program was implemented, a 2014 survey found, and 45 percent said they received a pay increase.  Deporting DACA recipients would reduce Social Security and Medicare tax revenue by $24.6 billion over a decade, according to research by the Immigrant Legal Resource Center.  Like Harrison, many business owners say they are struggling to fill open jobs. The unemployment rate is near a 16-year low, and the number of available jobs in June reached the highest level on records dating to 2001.  Andy Shallal, the owner of Busboys & Poets, a six-restaurant chain in Washington, D.C. and Virginia, said he is always looking to hire more people.  “Immigrants are the ones who show up looking for work,” he said. “We’re not passing over people who are citizens.”  Shallal, who once ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Washington, D.C., emigrated from Iraq in 1966.  Dan Finnigan, CEO of Jobvite, a company that makes recruiting software, also signed the business letter opposing Trump’s decision.  He agrees that the U.S. needs more workers and believes the information technology industry has benefited from greater immigration. But he was also moved by other concerns.  “It just struck me as immoral and un-American to send children who are not responsible for the decisions of their parents back to a nation, wherever they come from, that they don’t know,” he said.",2.5,1,[2.5]
87,486,9,8,2017,2017-09-08,Associated Press News,"It’s a ‘great thing’ to deal with Democrats, Trump now says","President Donald Trump smiles Kuwait leader Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah during a news conference in the East Room of the White House, Thursday, Sept. 7, 2017, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Frustrated with his own party’s leaders in Congress, President Donald Trump talked up his suddenly cozier relationship with Democrats on Thursday, raising the prospect of new deals on government spending and even posting one of his tweets at their behest.  “I think that’s a great thing for our country,” Trump said, describing his new and “different relationship” with Democrats.  In public, Republican leaders glossed over the striking turn of events, but lawmakers in both parties were privately puzzling over how Trump’s approach might affect the fate of the party’s agenda. And some conservatives openly criticized the deal-making, ideologically flexible president who defied GOP leaders in striking an agreement Wednesday to keep the government operating and raise the nation’s debt limit for just three months.  Democrats, privately leery about how long this new Trump might last, were upbeat in public.  As for Trump, after a series of legislative failures he has fumed to associates for months about Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan. On Thursday, he predicted a “much stronger coming together” of the two parties and pronounced himself ready to work with Democrats.  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi says President Donald Trump supports and would sign into law legislation that offers a path to legalization for immigrants brought to the country as children and living here illegally. (Sept. 7)  “I think that’s what the people of the United States want to see: They want to see some dialogue, they want to see coming together to an extent at least,” he told reporters.  Trump, a longtime Democrat who lived most of his life in deep blue New York City, has never closely adhered to Republican orthodoxy and has routinely shown a willingness to shift positions to seal deals. But his embrace of Democrats in recent days has been startling.  He overruled Republican leaders and his own treasury secretary on a debt ceiling agreement. He courted a Democratic senator with a flight to her home state on Air Force One. He offered reassurances on Thursday to young immigrants at the request of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, tweeting that those covered by the federal program he has promised to end “have nothing to worry about” over the next six months.  Trump also signaled a willingness to permanently do away with debt ceiling votes and move ahead on a stand-alone measure on the young immigrants, two suggestions opposed by most Republicans.  Trump’s unhappiness with GOP leaders has been building for months.  He has harshly criticized both McConnell and Ryan for failing to pass legislation to repeal the Obama health care law and for not doing more to shield him from the ongoing Russia investigations.  Then, wasting no time after Congress returned from summer break this week, Trump waved off Republicans who lobbied during a Wednesday Oval Office meeting for an 18-month debt ceiling extension, then 12 months and then six. When Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin continued to press an economic argument in favor of a longer-term deal, Trump cut him off mid-sentence.  Instead, Trump sided with Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer and Pelosi — “Chuck and Nancy,” as he referred to them later. That deal was underscored by a photo taken through the window of the Oval Office showing an animated Schumer pointing his finger in Trump’s face as the president smiled with his hands on Schumer’s arms.  Schumer, said Pelosi, “could speak New York to the president.”  Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, asked if the president was annoyed with the GOP leadership, said, “He probably is.”  “And believe me, as a Republican, so am I. As a citizen, I am too. I was promised that they would have repealed and replaced Obamacare by now,” Mulvaney told Fox Business Network.  House Speaker Ryan played down the tensions, saying the deal that Trump cut with Democrats on spending, the debt and Hurricane Harvey made sense as the nation deals with two major storms.  Ryan said the president didn’t want to have “some partisan fight in the middle of the response.”  While Ryan grimaced through his answers, Democrat Pelosi beamed as she told reporters that Trump had been acting at her request when he tweeted assurances Thursday that young immigrants won’t be targeted for deportation during the six-month phase-out period for a program that shields them from deportation. The administration announced this week that it is rescinding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), though giving Congress six months to address the issue.  Trump also spoke by phone Thursday with McConnell, Ryan and Schumer. And Schumer met with him again, this time about possible federal involvement in a rail link between New York and New Jersey.  “The president is committed to working across the aisle and doing what is needed to best serve the American people,” said spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders.  Trump later dined with Ryan at the White House, discussing the fall legislative agenda. The White House said after the dinner that Trump looked forward to “working together with Congress on bipartisan solutions.”  Trump told associates he was delighted with the positive news coverage of his foray into bipartisanship and boasted of the good press in calls to Pelosi and Schumer. But some Republicans were anything but pleased.  “Yesterday we saw Washington’s swamp continue to rise: Chuck Schumer wrote the art of the steal by taking hurricane relief hostage to guarantee a December showdown that favors Democratic spending priorities,” said Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska.  Republican Rep. Bill Flores of Texas suggested that Trump would come to regret working with the Democratic leaders.  “There may be a feeling of euphoria today, but then there is always the hangover that comes the next day,” he said.  And the No. 2 Senate GOP leader, John Cornyn of Texas, poured cold water on any idea that Trump’s split with his party this week would affect his campaigning in 2018.  “He can count,” Cornyn said. “And he’d much rather have (Republican Arizona Sen.) Jeff Flake, despite their disagreements, than he would have a Democrat and have us be in the minority.”  ___  Lemire reported from New York.

Asian stocks rose Thursday after President Donald Trump cut a deal with Democrats to extend borrowing limits to buy more time for the U.S. government, giving investors much needed relief. (AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko)  LONDON (AP) — European stock markets and the euro remained firm Thursday as the European Central Bank kept policy unchanged and said in a statement that it stands read to provide the eurozone economy a further stimulus if needed.  KEEPING SCORE: In Europe, Germany’s was up 0.9 percent at 12,324 while the CAC 40 in France was 0.7 percent higher at 5,135. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares rose 0.4 percent at 7,384. U.S. stocks were poised for a flat opening with Dow futures and the broader S&P 500 futures unchanged.  ECB DECISION: The central bank left its key interest rates and bond-purchase stimulus program unchanged. The decision was announced after a meeting Thursday of the bank’s 25-member governing council in Frankfurt. The bond purchases are set to run at 60 billion euros ($72 billion) per month through the end of the year, and longer if needed to raise inflation from the current 1.5 percent toward the bank’s goal of just under 2 percent. In a statement, the ECB said it could extend its stimulus in terms of its size or duration if the outlook less favorable.  ALL EYES ON DRAGHI: Markets are waiting to see whether European Central Bank President Mario Draghi will try to talk the euro down as he discusses the future of stimulus for the 19-country eurozone economy. The rise in the currency’s exchange rate is complicating life for the central bank. The exchange rate has risen 14 percent this year to $1.20. That could hurt exports and lower inflation, which the ECB is trying to raise. So far, Draghi has not expressed public concern and analysts are speculating he may now use the post-decision news conference to address the issue. Ahead of his briefing, the euro was up 0.5 percent at $1.1970.  ANALYST TAKE: “The ECB is probably not concerned about the past appreciation of the euro but rather about the future appreciation,” said Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING. “In this regards, to get out of the euro trap, don’t be surprised if Draghi presents a more detailed game plan than market participants expect.”  DEBT DEAL: Trump came to a deal with congressional Democrats to raise America’s debt limit for three months, overruling Republicans in the process. The immediate goal was ensuring money for storm relief as Trump sought to help speed the $7.9 billion aid bill for Hurricane Harvey victims, but the move also helps keep the government operating, removing some short-term uncertainty for investors.  FED IN FLUX: In a surprise announcement, the Federal Reserve said Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer will resign next month for personal reasons, leaving a fourth vacancy on the U.S. central bank’s seven-member governing board. The unexpected departure of Fischer, a widely respected economist, adds to a leadership vacuum at the top of the Fed as it navigates a difficult path. It plans to slowly raise interest rates as the U.S. economy grows and unemployment falls, even as inflation remains below target, complicating its future course.  NUCLEAR TENSIONS: North Korea’s nuclear program remains in the headlines though the focus now shifts to diplomacy, with the U.S., South Korea and Japan all calling for tougher sanctions including cutting off oil supplies. Meanwhile, the U.S. military finished placing more launchers for a high-tech U.S. missile defense system installed in South Korea to better cope with North Korean threats.  ASIA’S DAY: Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 0.2 percent to close at 19,396.52 and South Korea’s Kospi jumped 1.1 percent to 2,346.19. The Shanghai Composite slid 0.6 percent to 3,365.50 and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index gave up early gains to fall 0.3 percent to 27,522.92.  ENERGY: Oil futures renewed their climb.

The world’s biggest food and drinks company, Nestle, says it is buying husband-and-wife startup Sweet Earth, which sells frozen burritos stuffed with quinoa, beans and other vegetarian ingredients. The Swiss company, whose frozen food brands include Lean Cuisine and Stouffer’s, said Thursday, Sept. 7, 2017 that the deal will boost its presence in the fast-growing market for plant-based foods.(Laurent Gillieron/Keystone via AP, file)  GENEVA (AP) — The maker of Hot Pockets wants to go vegetarian, California-style.  Nestle, the world’s biggest food and drinks company, is buying husband-and-wife startup Sweet Earth, which sells frozen burritos stuffed with quinoa, beans and other vegetarian ingredients.  The move echoes efforts by packaged food conglomerates across the world that have been trying to appeal more to consumers who favor fresher foods, smaller, local brands and are worried about the ingredients they eat.  Nestle, whose frozen food brands include Lean Cuisine and Stouffer’s, recently invested in online meals company Freshly, which delivers cooked meals to customer’s doorsteps that it says are gluten-free and don’t contain refined sugars. In 2012, Campbell Soup bought natural foods maker Bolthouse Farms.  And on Thursday, rival Unilever said it was buying Pukka Herbs, a small but fast-growing organic herbal tea business.  “This segment has been identified for us globally as a key area a few years ago,” said Wayne England, head of strategic food operations at Nestle. “Giving the world better access to vegetarian-based or plant-based food is something we want to do.”  Nestle, which is based in Vevey, Switzerland, said Sweet Earth, which reportedly had $25 mlllion in revenue last year, will remain a stand-alone business, and stay at its headquarters in Moss Landing, California. It declined to specify the cost of the deal.  Gaurav Gupta of the strategy management firm Kotter International said the Sweet Earth and Pukka deals amounted to “another reminder that food businesses need to look outside for innovation and growth.”  Nestle will need to scale up Sweet Earth and draw on its knowledge and processes if it hopes to reap the full benefits from the deal and alter the consumer’s conception, he said. Many people associate Nestle with chocolate and coffee.  “Really changing consumer perceptions will take a shift in products within the core brands, not just adding on some healthier products through acquisitions,” said Gupta in an e-mail.  Sweet Earth co-founder Kelly Swette, who will continue to run the company with co-founder and husband Brian, said in an interview: “We believe in redefining frozen food.”  She said several companies approached Sweet Earth about a buyout, but declined to name them. The deal with Nestle, she said, will help get Sweet Earth into more frozen food aisles. It’s currently in more than 10,000 stores, including Walmart and Whole Foods. England said Nestle wants to protect and grow the Swette’s relationship now with 273 Whole Foods stores.  Sweet Earth’s best-selling products are its burritos, but it also sells other frozen meals, including mushroom ravioli and veggie burgers.  “At the moment, if you look at the range at Sweet Earth, it’s very much hand-held: Burritos, this kind of (product) ... and think we can work with them to extend it into frozen meals,” Nestle’s England said. “We can help them accelerate.”  Nestle says the deal will give it “immediate entry” into the plant-based foods segment that is expected to be a $5 billion market within three years. It says up to half of all U.S. consumers are seeking more such foods in their diet.  It said the Sweet Earth acquisition is aimed to complement its growing vegetarian, plant-based offer in Europe, such as “charcuterie vegetarian” — essentially plant-based cold cuts — under the Herta brand in France, and the launch of the Garden Gourmet line. It says the market has been growing in high double-digit percentage rates.  “We would see this Garden Gourmet brand being our Sweet Earth of Europe, and then within that, we would look for the products to be shared,” England said.  At its core, the deal is about Nestle’s need to constantly adapt to changing consumer tastes, particularly among health- and “authenticity”-minded consumers like many Millennials these days.  Such consumers “look for more transparency, more natural, more ingredients they understand, that can relate to their own kitchens,” England said. “We have a drive to find the trend of authenticity in every one of our products.”  ___  Joseph Pisani in New York contributed to this report.",3.0,1,[3.0]

Exports rose 5.5 percent over a year earlier to $199.2 billion, down from July’s 7.2 percent growth, trade data showed Friday. Imports rose 13.3 percent to $157.2 billion, up from the previous month’s 11 percent.  Forecasters have warned Chinese economic growth will cool this year, dampening demand for foreign goods as controls on bank lending to slow a rise in debt take hold.  The International Monetary Fund expects this year’s economic growth to slip to 6.6 percent from last year’s 6.7 percent and to below 6.2 percent in 2018.  “The strong import data suggests that domestic demand may be more resilient than expected,” said Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics in a report.  Export growth was unexpectedly strong in the first half of the year, a positive sign for Chinese leaders who want to avoid job losses in trade-related industries.  China has been credited with helping to support global demand and weaker imports might hurt suppliers for whom this country is a major market.  China’s global trade surplus declined by 19 percent in August from a year earlier to $42 billion.  The politically sensitive surplus with the United States rose 4 percent to $26.2 billion.  American officials have resumed criticizing China’s large surpluses and currency control after President Donald Trump said in April he would temporarily shelve complaints while Washington and Beijing cooperated on North Korea. This week, Trump threatened to block imports from countries that do business with the North, China’s main trading partner.  “Downside risks to exports remain, in particular in the area of U.S.-China trade relations,” said Kuijs.  China’s trade surplus with the 28-nation European Union, its biggest trading partner, shrank 14 percent to $11.7 billion.  ___  General Administration of Customs of China: www.customs.gov.cn",2.75,2,"[2.5, 3.0]"
99,573,9,8,2017,2017-09-08,Associated Press News,Correction: Equifax-Cyberattack story," In a story Sept. 7 about the cyberattack on Equifax, The Associated Press reported erroneously that Experian is offering free credit monitoring to all U.S. consumers for a year. It is Equifax that is offering the free credit monitoring.  A corrected version of the story is below:  Equifax breach exposes 143 million people to identity theft  Credit monitoring company Equifax says a breach exposed Social Security numbers and other data from 143 million Americans  By MICHAEL LIEDTKE  AP Technology Writer  SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Credit monitoring company Equifax has been hit by a high-tech heist that exposed the Social Security numbers and other sensitive information about 143 million Americans. Now the unwitting victims have to worry about the threat of having their identities stolen.  The Atlanta-based company, one of three major U.S. credit bureaus, said Thursday that “criminals” exploited a U.S. website application to access files between mid-May and July of this year.  The theft obtained consumers’ names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and, in some cases, driver’s license numbers. The purloined data can be enough for crooks to hijack the identities of people whose credentials were stolen through no fault of their own, potentially wreaking havoc on their lives. Equifax said its core credit-reporting databases don’t appear to have been breached.  “On a scale of one to 10, this is a 10 in terms of potential identity theft,” said Gartner security analyst Avivah Litan. “Credit bureaus keep so much data about us that affects almost everything we do.”  Lenders rely on the information collected by the credit bureaus to help them decide whether to approve financing for homes, cars and credit cards. Credit checks are even sometimes done by employers when deciding whom to hire for a job.  Equifax discovered the hack July 29, but waited until Thursday to warn consumers. The Atlanta-based company declined to comment on that delay or anything else beyond its published statement. It’s not unusual for U.S. authorities to ask a company hit in a major hack to delay public notice so that investigators can pursue the perpetrators.  The company established a website, https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com/, where people can check to see if their personal information may have been stolen. Consumers can also call 866-447-7559 for more information. Equifax is also offering free credit monitoring to all U.S. consumers for a year.  “This is clearly a disappointing event for our company, and one that strikes at the heart of who we are and what we do,” Equifax CEO Richard Smith said in a statement. “I apologize to consumers and our business customers for the concern and frustration this causes.”  This isn’t the biggest data breach in history. That indignity still belongs to Yahoo, which was targeted in at least two separate digital burglaries that affected more than 1 billion of its users’ accounts throughout the world.  But no Social Security numbers or drivers’ license information were disclosed in the Yahoo break-in.  Equifax’s security lapse could be the largest theft involving Social Security numbers, one of the most common methods used to confirm a person’s identity in the U.S. It eclipses a 2015 hack at health insurer Anthem Inc. that involved the Social Security numbers of about 80 million people.  Any data breach threatens to tarnish a company’s reputation, but it is especially mortifying for Equifax, whose entire business revolves around providing a clear financial profile of consumers that lenders and other businesses can trust.  “This really undermines their credibility,” Litan said. It also could undermine the integrity of the information stockpiled by two other major credit bureaus, Experian and TransUnion, since they hold virtually all the data that Equifax does, Litan said.  Equifax’s stock dropped 13 percent to $124.10 in extended trading after its announcement of the breach.  Three Equifax executives insulated themselves from that downturn by selling shares worth a combined $1.8 million just a few days after the company discovered the breach on July 29, according to documents filed with securities regulators.  The sales, executed on August 1 and August 2, were made by: John Gamble, Equifax’s chief financial officer; Rodolfo Ploder, Equifax’s president of workforce solutions; and Joseph Loughran, Equifax’s president of U.S. information solutions. Bloomberg News first reported the divestitures.  In a subsequent statement, Equifax said the three executives “had no knowledge that an intrusion had occurred at the time they sold their shares.”  The potential aftershocks of the Equifax breach should make it clear that Social Security numbers are becoming an unreliable way to verify a person’s identity, Nathaniel Gleicher, the former director of cybersecurity policy in the White House during the Obama administration, said in an email statement.  “This breach might just have put the nail in the coffin of the idea that we can use personal identifiers like Social Security numbers as security factors,” wrote Gleicher, who now oversees cybersecurity strategy for computer security firm Illumio.  In addition to the personal information stolen in its breach, Equifax said the credit card numbers for about 209,000 U.S. consumers were also taken, as were “certain dispute documents” containing personal information for approximately 182,000 U.S. individuals.  Equifax warned that hackers also may have some “limited personal information” about British and Canadian residents.

South Florida officials are expanding evacuation orders as Hurricane Irma approaches, telling more than a half-million people to seek safety inland. (AP Photo/David Goldman)  After knocking down parts of the vital tourism industry in the Caribbean, Hurricane Irma is spinning toward Florida, another vacation haven.  Tourism accounts for 1.4 million jobs in the Sunshine State, where more than 112 million people visited last year and spent $109 billion. Resorts and hotels there could suffer instant destruction from Irma’s winds or lingering damage if vacationers stay away.  “We will still have our beaches after Irma, but some people who were planning to come to Florida will change those plans,” said Sean Snaith, an economics professor at the University of Central Florida. “They may postpone, or change destinations.”  In the Caribbean, at least 21 people were killed when Irma slammed into the islands as one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes ever. Heavy damage was reported on St. Martin, St. Barts and other famous beach destinations.  Roads and airports will need to be repaired or even rebuilt, and it’s uncertain whether that can be done in time for the winter high season on the hardest-hit islands. Wealthier islands with more private insurance will fare better, said Gabriel Torres, an analyst for Moody’s Investors Service who has studied the effect of storms in the Caribbean.  “It has an impact on tourism because some hotels will decide not to rebuild or take a long time to rebuild, and that’s lost revenue,” Torres said. “That can take years to recover.”  Torres said St. Martin, which is divided into Dutch Sint Maarten and French Saint-Martin, will benefit as their European patrons provide aid for rebuilding.  If there is any consolation, it may be that “the damage to tourism is going to be less than feared because a great many popular islands have been spared,” including Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao, said Arthur Frommer, the founder of Frommer’s travel guides.  Here is a snapshot of Irma’s likely effects on other key industries:  — AIRLINES: More than 4,600 flights in the storm’s path have been canceled, including flights this weekend in Florida, and the number is expected to soar, according to tracking service FlightAware.com.  That means more lost revenue for the airlines, which canceled about 11,000 flights when flooding from Hurricane Harvey shut down both main Houston airports for several days.  Harvey landed as a Category 4 hurricane on Aug. 25 near Corpus Christi, Texas. It weakened to a tropical storm but lingered in Southeast Texas for days, dumping torrential rainfall in the Houston area that flooded homes and highways.  United Airlines and Southwest Airlines were hit hardest by Harvey. Savanthi Syth, an airline analyst for Raymond James, said JetBlue Airways, Allegiant Air and Spirit Airlines were most vulnerable to Irma because of their higher concentration of flights that touch Florida and the Caribbean. Among the larger carriers, American Airlines has the most exposure to Irma, Syth said.  — AUTOS: Irma won’t damage as many cars and trucks as Harvey did, but the toll is still expected to be extensive, according to analysts from Cox Automotive, which publishes Kelley Blue Book and Autotrader.  Cox said 130,000 to 200,000 vehicles will be lost in Miami, West Palm Beach and Fort Myers-Naples in south Florida. By comparison, 300,000 to 500,000 vehicles were damaged in the Houston area.  In Florida, “People are driving their cars away. Look at I-95 — they’re leaving,” said Brian Meredith, an insurance analyst with UBS. “Houston was different because people hadn’t left.”  — INSURANCE: The industry is in good financial shape because insurers haven’t had to pay out for mammoth losses like back-to-back hurricanes in over a decade, analysts say. But they are wary of Irma’s predicted path, which would mean landfall in the densely populated area from Miami to Fort Lauderdale.  “This is the sort of path that could constitute the elusive 1-in-100 year event” that insurers use to judge catastrophes, Matthew Carletti, an analyst for JMP Securities, wrote in a note to clients.  RMS, a company that advises insurers, estimates Irma could cause wind damage of up to $70 billion in the U.S., almost all of it in Florida.  Meredith, the UBS analyst, said some insurers and re-insurers might need to issue debt or equity to raise more capital after getting hit with Harvey and Irma claims. Homeowner policies could become more costly but not by a great deal, he said, because premium increases require approval from regulators.  — AGRICULTURE: Irma could be a devastating blow to a Florida citrus industry that is already reeling from a decade-long infestation of citrus greening disease, which leads to fewer and bitter-tasting fruit.  If the storm’s path takes it through the center of the state — the citrus-growing region — it could rip oranges and grapefruit from their branches or even uproot trees, said Lisa Lochridge, spokeswoman for the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association.  “This has the potential to be devastating,” Lochridge said.  — OIL AND GAS: One-third or more of service stations were out of gas in several Florida cities including Miami, West Palm Beach, Fort Myers and Tampa, according to GasBuddy.  Compared with Hurricane Harvey, which knocked out refineries and caused the nationwide average price of gasoline to jump about 30 cents a gallon, Irma is less likely to have such a quick and obvious effect on Americans beyond the storm’s path.  ___  Tom Krisher in Detroit and Steve Karnowski in Minneapolis contributed to this report.  .",3.75,2,"[4.5, 3.0]"

Credit monitoring company Equifax says a breach exposed social security numbers and other data from about 143 million Americans. The Atlanta-based company said Thursday, Sept. 7, 2017, that ""criminals"" exploited a U.S. website application to access files between mid-May and July of this year. (AP Photo/Mike Stewart)  NEW YORK (AP) — A day after credit-reporting company Equifax disclosed that “criminals” had stolen vital data about 143 million Americans, it had somehow managed to leave much of the public in the dark about their exposure, how they should protect themselves and what Equifax planned to do for those affected.  The breach is unquestionably serious. It exposed crucial pieces of personal data that criminals could use to commit identity theft, from Social Security numbers and birthdates to address histories and legal names.  That data — the “crown jewels of personal information,” in the words of independent credit analyst John Ulzheimer — can’t be changed, and once it’s in circulation, it’s basically out there forever.  But Equifax’s response has satisfied almost no one.  UNHAPPINESS EVERYWHERE  Consumers complained of jammed phone lines and uninformed representatives. An Equifax website set up to help people determine their exposure looked like a scam to some, and provided inconsistent and unhelpful information to others. Congress planned hearings.  Anders Ohlsson, a 47-year-old technical manager in Scotts Valley, California, called a hotline multiple times and was disconnected; entered the last six digits of his Social Security number into Equifax’s emergency website; and finally spoke with a call center manager. He still doesn’t know whether his information has been compromised.  “I don’t think I’ve gotten hold of a person that actually cares,” he said. “Now they’re fumbling to tell people what’s going on. But they really don’t know what’s going on.”  Equifax plays a key role in the financial industry, making this breach more alarming than previous ones at Yahoo or retailers. The company is a storehouse of personal information, like how much people owe on their houses and whether they have court judgments against them.  Lenders rely on the information collected by three big credit bureaus — Equifax, TransUnion and Experian — to help them decide on financing for homes, cars and credit cards. Credit checks are sometimes done by employers when deciding whom to hire for a job.  WHAT YOU CAN DO  Even if you don’t know if you’re one of the 143 million, you might want to consider extreme protective measures.  Your strongest immediate option involves placing a credit freeze on their files with the major credit bureaus. That locks down your information, making it impossible for outsiders to open new accounts and bank cards in your name. But it also blocks you from opening new accounts, and might involve fees depending on the state you live in.  “The credit freeze is the nuclear option of credit protection,” said Matt Schulz, an analyst with CreditCards.com. “But in the wake of a breach this big, it’s worth considering.”  You should also be more diligent about checking your credit reports, where you can see if anyone has opened unauthorized accounts in your name . You can get those files for free once a year from the three major bureaus; use the official site, annualcreditreport.com .  It’s best to spread those requests out by getting one every four months. And you’ll need to be ready to keep checking for a while — potentially years.  “Bad guys can be very patient with data,” Schulz said.  If you’re not ready for the freeze, Ulzheimer recommends setting up fraud alerts on your files. These force creditors to contact you directly, usually by phone, for approval before approving an account.  And if you’ve been a victim of repeated identity fraud, you can request a new Social Security number with the Social Security Administration.  In addition to the emergency Equifax website, https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com/, you can also call 866-447-7559 for information. The company also says it will send mail to all who had personally identifiable information stolen.  HOW EQUIFAX REACTED  Any data breach threatens to tarnish a company’s reputation, but Equifax hasn’t done much to minimize that damage.  Atlanta-based Equifax said Thursday the breach took place between mid-May and July of this year. It discovered the hack July 29, but waited until Thursday to warn consumers. Its communications with the public have so far been limited to official statements.  Then there’s the company’s emergency-information website. To Georgia Weidman, founder and chief technology officer for security firm Shevirah, it looks a lot like the kind of site scammers would use to trick people into giving up passwords or other crucial information.  “It’s teaching people entirely the wrong things about using the internet securely,” Weidman said. She said says she’s also troubled by Equifax’s approach to security generally, including reports that it didn’t respond to basic scripting bugs it was warned about last year.  Company officials are also under scrutiny. Three Equifax executives sold shares worth a combined $1.8 million just a few days after the company discovered the breach, according to documents filed with securities regulators. Equifax said the three executives — one of them the company’s chief financial officer — didn’t know about the breach at the time of the sales, but didn’t answer further questions.  Equifax’s security lapse could be the largest theft involving Social Security numbers, one of the most common ways to confirm a person’s identity in the U.S. It eclipses a 2015 hack at health insurer Anthem Inc. that involved the Social Security numbers of about 80 million people .  FALLOUT  Washington regulators and politicians swiftly criticized Equifax, and Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said he will call for congressional hearings.  An Equifax requirement that appeared to force affected customers into arbitration also drew a backlash. Democrats in the House and Senate called on the company to pull back from language that suggested anyone who signs up for credit monitoring also gives up their right to join a class-action lawsuit against Equifax.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the nation’s chief watchdog for financial services, likewise blasted the arbitration requirement. The CFPB recently passed a rule requiring financial companies to let customers sue together when a large group has been wronged.  New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman said he was starting his own investigation.  After a day of all that, Equifax released a statement Friday evening declaring that the arbitration requirement and class-action waiver will not apply to this particular breach. The company also said it had fixed problems with the emergency website and tripled its call center team to over 2,000 agents.  Equifax shares fell about 13 percent to $123.75 in heavy trading. The decline equates to about $2.28 billion in lost market value.  ___  AP Technology Writers Michael Liedtke and Ryan Nakashima in San Francisco, and Matt O’Brien in New York, contributed to this report.",4.75,2,"[5.0, 4.5]"

The world’s richest company appears ready to aim for its own Emmy-worthy programming along the lines of HBO’s “Game of Thrones” and Netflix’s “Stranger Things.”  Apple lured away two longtime TV executives Jaime Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg from Sony Corp. in June and has given them $1 billion to spend on original shows during the next year, according to a Wall Street Journal report quoting unnamed people.  The programming would only be available on a subscription channel, most likely bundled with the company’s existing Apple Music streaming service. Apple declined to comment.  While $1 billion is a lot of money, it’s a drop in the bucket for Apple and its $262 billion cash hoard. But it’s still enough to vault Apple into the top tier of tech-industry outsiders producing their own slates of television shows.  HISTORY NOT REPEATING  Hollywood has long shuddered at the thought of Apple training its sights on TV the way it once did on the music business.  Almost 15 years ago, Apple’s then-CEO Steve Jobs convinced record labels to let the company sell digital music on its iTunes store for 99 cents a single, a deal the music industry was happy to take in the face of growing music piracy enabled by Napster. Over time, though, Apple’s dominance in digital music chafed music executives, who saw the company siphoning off a chunk of their profits.  Movies and television have proven much harder for Apple to crack. The company’s interest in transforming television has been an open secret for years, but Hollywood has so far spurned Apple’s efforts to make itself an indispensable digital middleman for video.  In a way, Netflix beat Apple to the punch with its ground-breaking video streaming service. Launched in 2007, that service pioneered “binge watching” of entire TV seasons on any device with an internet connection. That gave new life to existing shows such as “Breaking Bad,” whose creator credits Netflix with its survival , and spawned the creation of other series tailor-made for bingeing.  Netflix also helped unleash a crescendo of creativity in Hollywood. Follow-on rivals Amazon and Hulu also boast popular video streaming services, and mainstream broadcasters such as CBS and Walt Disney Co. — the owner of ABC and ESPN, among other networks — are also jumping in.  BUSINESS NECESSITY  All of that has increased the pressure on Apple to step up its game in TV — not least because the increasing popularity of streaming is hurting its business of renting and selling video from iTunes.  Apple “doesn’t want to be left behind,” said Debby Ruth, senior vice president of consumer research firm Magid. “This is a way for them to put a stake in the ground.”  This year, the company released its first two original series — “Planet of the Apps” and “Carpool Karaoke” — on its Apple Music service, which has 27 million subscribers. But neither show has generated much buzz or critical acclaim.  The recent hiring of Erlicht and Van Amburg signaled Apple’s intent to make bigger splash. The executives have helped orchestrate several TV hits, including AMC’s “Breaking Bad,” and more recently branched out into video streaming with “The Crown,” which landed on Netflix last year and is up for 13 Emmy nominations in the Sept. 17 ceremony.  Apple also has a not-so-secret weapon: hundreds of millions of iPhones and iPads already in the hands of faithful fans. It could easily transform those into a marketing platform to lure users to its TV service.  MAKING IT IN HOLLYWOOD  But the company has a steep hill to climb.  Netflix has more than 100 million worldwide subscribers and a video library that will add 1,000 hours of original programming this year alone. And HBO has become the Emmys’ pacesetter since branching into original programming 20 years ago.  Both companies vastly outspend Apple’s reported $1 billion production budget. HBO spends about $2 billion annually on its programming, which garnered 111 nominations in this year’s Emmy Awards — more than any other network. Netflix, which boasts the second most Emmy nominations with 91, expects to spend $6 billion on programming this year.  Apple is still experimenting in TV, said Gene Munster, a longtime Apple watcher and managing partner with the research and venture capital firm Loup Ventures. “In five years, I bet Apple will either be investing $10 billion a year in content or zero,” said Munster. “It’s going to be one or the other.”  JOBS’ LEGACY  Jobs discussed his ambitions to shake up TV with his biographer Walter Issacson shortly before his death in 2011. “He very much wanted to do for television sets what he had done for computers, music players, and phones: make them simple and elegant,” Isaacson wrote.  But no Apple television ever materialized. Instead, Apple has periodically upgraded its Apple TV, which isn’t a television — just a video streaming player that connects to TVs. That device has been losing market share to other streaming players made by Roku, Amazon and Google, according to the research firm Park Associates.  Building a successful programming line-up could give Apple more leverage to license shows from other Hollywood production houses. It might even embolden the company to finally release its own streaming TV set.  Apple will presumably also want to emulate Netflix’s ability to exploit usage data to determine what it thinks audiences want to watch. Netflix’s data analysis has helped it attract 25.5 million more subscribers in the U.S. alone since the February 2013 debut of its first original series, “House of Cards.”  But if Apple decides it needs a little more help in video streaming, Munster thinks there’s in one-in-three chance that it will buy Netflix to instantly gain the cachet and expertise in TV programming that it craves.",2.75,2,"[1.0, 4.5]"

China's campaign to stamp out use technology that allows web surfers to evade its internet filters is disrupting work and study for entrepreneurs, scientists and students. The crackdown comes as the ruling Communist Party tightens political control ahead of a congress at which President Xi Jinping is due to be appointed to a second 5-year term as leader. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan, File)  BEIJING (AP) — Frank Chen’s e-commerce business has nothing to do with politics but he worries it might be sunk by the Communist Party’s latest effort to control what the Chinese public sees online.  Chen’s 25-employee company sells clothes and appliances to Americans and Europeans through platforms including Facebook, one of thousands of websites blocked by China’s web filters. Chen reaches it using a virtual private network, but that window might be closing after Beijing launched a campaign in January to stamp out use of VPNs to evade its “Great Firewall.”  “Our entire business might be paralyzed,” said Chen by phone from the western city of Chengdu. Still, he added later in a text message, “national policy deserves a positive response and we fully support it.”  The crackdown threatens to disrupt work and study for millions of Chinese entrepreneurs, scientists and students who rely on websites they can see only with a VPN. The technology, developed to create secure, encrypted links between computers, allows Chinese web users to see a blocked site by hiding the address from government filters.  Astronomers and physicists use services such as Google Scholar and Dropbox, accessible only via VPN, to share research and stay in touch with foreign colleagues. Merchants use Facebook and other blocked social media to find customers. Students look for material in subjects from history to film editing on YouTube and other blocked sites.  Control over information is especially sensitive ahead of October’s twice-a-decade ruling party congress at which President Xi Jinping is due to be named to a second five-year term as leader.  The VPN crackdown is part of a campaign to tighten political control that activists say is the most severe since the 1989 suppression of the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement.  Dozens of activists and lawyers have been detained. A cybersecurity law that took effect in June tightens control on online data. Regulators have stepped up censorship of social media and video websites.  How many people might be affected is unclear, but consumer research firm GlobalWebIndex said a survey of Chinese web surfers this year found 14 percent use a VPN daily. If that percentage holds for China’s total online population of 731 million, it suggests the country might have as many as 100 million regular users.  Some 8.8 percent of people in the survey use VPNs to look at “restricted sites,” according to GlobalWebIndex. That would be equivalent to 65 million people, or the population of Britain.  Communist leaders encourage web use for business and education. They want online commerce to help transform China from a low-wage factory into a high-tech consumer society. But they reject the notion of a borderless internet and free flow of information.  Chinese web users without VPNs cannot see the most popular global websites including Google and social media such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, as well as news outlets and human rights groups.  In the latest crackdown, regulators say only government-authorized VPNs will be allowed. The operator of a popular service, Green VPN, told customers in June it had been ordered to close. Others shut down without warning.  “You have to leave a window for people, for those who need it,” said Wen Jian, a securities trader in Beijing.  Wen said he needs to find financial information and Google, accessible only with a VPN, is more effective than Chinese search engines. But his VPN quit working two months ago.  “As far as I know, some government people use VPNs too,” said Wen, 27. “They read things abroad. Why can they have it and we cannot?”  The crackdown reflects Xi’s notion of “internet sovereignty,” or Beijing’s absolute right to control what people can do and see online.  Unauthorized VPNs already were banned but authorities appeared to ignore them, possibly to avoid disrupting business or to defuse resistance among professionals and academics.  Government spokespeople refuse to acknowledge any site is blocked, though researchers say they can see attempts to reach sites such as Google stopped within servers operated by state-owned China Telecom Ltd., which controls China’s links to the global internet.  Regulators have yet to say who will be allowed to use government-licensed VPNs or what they can see. But a letter sent by China Telecom to some corporate customers this year offers a hint: It says VPNs can link only to a company’s headquarters abroad and no other sites. It warns violators will lose access.  Until now, web controls have acted like a tax, allowing users to see blocked sites by paying for a VPN, according to Margaret E. Roberts, a political scientist at the University of California at San Diego.  “As VPNs become more difficult to access, it’s like the government is raising the tax,” said Roberts in an email. “If VPNs were illegal, we would expect a different calculation for those seeking access.”  In a sign of a more severe official stance, a 26-year-old entrepreneur who sold VPN service in Dongguan, near Hong Kong, was sentenced in March to nine months in prison.  The agency in charge of the crackdown, the Cyberspace Administration of China, and the Cabinet press office didn’t respond to questions sent by fax and email about what, if anything, the public will be allowed to do with authorized VPNs.  Chen, the online merchant, said he heard private companies might be permitted but he has yet to apply.  The economic impact is unclear, but other Chinese data controls already are a drag on business.  The European Center for International Political Economy estimated in 2014 curbs in effect or planned could cut economic growth by up to 1.1 percentage points. That would be equal to as much as $130 billion of lost activity in China’s $12 trillion-a-year economy.  “I asked some friends, and if a large number of VPNs are banned, then everyone’s response is there will be a big impact on their business,” Chen said.  Chinese leaders faced similar complaints after the “Great Firewall” was activated in 2002. It blocked access to Google, prompting an outcry from scientists and businesspeople who needed to find research papers and commercial information.  Public complaints have been muted in part because Chinese companies have developed alternatives to popular global services.  Instead of Facebook and Twitter, Chinese social media users have WeChat and Sina Weibo. Baidu Inc. provides Google-style search that complies with official censorship.  “I am pretty lazy,” said Hao Kailin, a landscape designer in Beijing who finds images online for work. “If it is too much trouble to look for pictures from prohibited websites, then I give up.”  ___  Associated Press researcher Fu Ting contributed to this report.",3.75,2,"[3.0, 4.5]"
113,668,9,10,2017,2017-09-10,Associated Press News,China looks at ending sales of gasoline cars," China is joining France and Britain in announcing plans to end sales of gasoline and diesel cars.  China’s industry ministry is developing a timetable to end production and sale of traditional fuel cars and will promote development of electric technology, state media on Sunday cited a Cabinet official as saying.  The reports gave no possible target date, but Beijing is stepping up pressure on automakers to accelerate development of electrics.  China is the biggest auto market by number of vehicles sold, giving any policy changes outsize importance for the global industry.  A deputy industry minister, Xin Guobin, said at an auto industry forum on Saturday his ministry has begun “research on formulating a timetable to stop production and sales of traditional energy vehicles,” according to the Xinhua News Agency and the Communist Party newspaper People’s Daily.  France and Britain announced in July they will stop sales of gasoline and diesel automobiles by 2040 as part of efforts to reduce pollution and carbon emissions that contribute to global warming.  Communist leaders also want to curb China’s growing appetite for imported oil and see electric cars as a promising industry in which their country can take an early lead.  China passed the United States last year as the biggest electric car market. Sales of electrics and gasoline-electric hybrids rose 50 percent over 2015 to 336,000 vehicles, or 40 percent of global demand. U.S. sales totaled 159,620.  The reports of Xin’s comments in the eastern city of Tianjin gave no other details about electric car policy but cited him as saying Beijing plans to “elevate new energy vehicles to a new strategic level.”  Beijing has supported electric development with billions of dollars in research subsidies and incentives to buyers, but is switching to a quota system that will shift the financial burden to automakers.  Under the proposed quotas, electric and hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles would have to make up 8 percent of each automaker’s output next year, 10 percent in 2019 and 12 percent in 2020. Automakers that fail to meet their target could buy credits from competitors that have a surplus.  Beijing has ordered state-owned Chinese power companies to speed up installation of charging stations to increase the appeal of electrics.  Chinese automaker BYD Auto, a unit of battery maker BYD Ltd., is the world’s biggest electric vehicle maker by number of units sold. It sells gasoline-electric hybrid sedans and SUVs in China and markets all-electric taxis and buses in the United States, Europe and Latin America as well as in China.  Volvo Cars, owned by China’s Geely Holding Group, announced plans this year to make electric cars in China for global sale starting in 2019.  General Motors Co., Volkswagen AG and Nissan Motor Co. and others have announced they are launching or looking at joint ventures with Chinese partners to develop and manufacture electric vehicles in China.  ___  Associated Press researcher Fu Ting contributed to this report.",4.75,2,"[5.0, 4.5]"

JOHN’S, Antigua (AP) — Strung like beads along the northeast edge of the Caribbean, the Leeward Islands are tiny, remote and beautiful, with azure waters and ocean breezes drawing tourists from around the world.  The wild isolation that made St. Barts, St. Martin, Anguilla and the Virgin Islands vacation paradises has turned them into cutoff, chaotic nightmares in the wake of Hurricane Irma, which left 22 people dead, mostly in the Leeward Islands. Looting and lawlessness were reported Saturday by both French and Dutch authorities, who were sending in extra troops to restore order.  The Category 5 storm snapped the islands’ fragile links to the outside world with a direct hit early Wednesday, pounding their small airports, decapitating cellphone towers, filling harbors with overturned, crushed boats and leaving thousands of tourists and locals desperate to escape.  The situation worsened Saturday with the passage of Category 4 Hurricane Jose, which shuttered airports and halted emergency boat traffic through the weekend.  Looting, gunshots and a lack of clean drinking water were reported on the French Caribbean territory of St. Martin, home to five-star resorts and a multimillion estate owned by President Donald Trump.  A man on the Caribbean island of Anguilla videos waves crashes through his house as Hurricane Irma devastates the island. (Sept. 9)  Federal officials deployed C-130s to evacuate U.S. citizens from the French Caribbean island of St. Martin to Puerto Rico. Nearly 160 were evacuated on Friday and approximately 700 more on Saturday.  The amphibious assault USS Wasp evacuated hospital patients from St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands to St. Croix and Puerto Rico. The Norwegian Cruise Line turned a cruise ship into an ad-hoc rescue boat, sending a ship with 10 restaurants, a spa and a casino to evacuate 2,000 tourists from St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Norwegian Sky cruise ship was due to arrive Tuesday and take its charges to Miami.  More than 1,100 police, military officials and others were deployed to St. Martin and the nearby French Caribbean territory of St. Barts, where they used helicopters to identify the cars of people looting stores and homes. French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced Saturday night that France would be sending more Foreign Legion troops, paratroopers and other reinforcements to St. Martin starting Sunday.  Philippe said the several hundred gendarmes, soldiers and other security forces there were working in “difficult conditions” and needed help.  The government told all residents to stay inside and put the island and St. Barts on its highest alert level as Hurricane Jose rolled through the area.  The island is divided between French St. Martin and Dutch St. Maarten, where the Dutch government estimated Saturday that 70 percent of houses were badly damaged or destroyed, leaving much of the 40,000 population in public shelters as they braced for the arrival of Jose.  Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the situation remained “grim” on the island where widespread looting had broken out and a state of emergency was in force.  Rutte said some 230 Dutch troops and police were patrolling St. Maarten to maintain order and deliver aid and a further 200 would arrive in coming days. The government evacuated 65 dialysis patients from St. Maarten’s hospital, which also was hard hit by Irma.  The islands’ woes increased as the airport on St. Barts was closed, and those in Anguilla and St. Martin were open only to the military, rescue crews and aid organizations. Others, including St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands, banned flyovers.  Late Saturday, St. Maarten Prime Minister William Marlin said about 1,600 tourists had been evacuated and efforts are being made to move 1,200 more.  Marlin said many countries and people have offered help to St. Maarten, but authorities are waiting on the weather conditions to see how this can be coordinated.  Before the hurricanes, St. Maarten’s Princess Juliana International Airport was one of the former Dutch colony’s major tourist draws thanks to a runway that ended just a few meters (yards) from the sandy crescent of Maho Beach, where people could stand and watch as arriving jets skimmed low over their heads.  After Irma, aerial footage shot by Dutch marines showed that Maho Beach’s sands had washed away and the airport was badly damaged. The Dutch military are using the runway, which was inundated by high tides during the hurricane, to ferry in aid supplies but say it’s not yet open to civilian flights as there are no runway lights or air traffic control. The Canadian low-cost airline and tour agency Sunwing evacuated some Canadian tourists from St Maarten to Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic on Saturday.  Ports in St. John, St. Thomas and elsewhere remained closed.  As Jose neared, the last airplane flew in to St. Martin’s battered Grande-Case airport Friday carrying workers to help re-establish the island’s water supply and electricity. French authorities said some 1,105 recovery workers were deployed on St. Martin and St. Barts. A tanker with 350 tons of fresh water was also on its way.  By Saturday, damage was estimated to have already reached 1.2 billion euros ($1.44 billion).  France said it hoped to allow commercial boats to go to and from St. Martin and nearby Guadeloupe on Monday, when waters are expected to calm.  French President Emmanuel Macron came under criticism for his government’s handling of the crisis.  Once known for pink sandy beaches that attracted celebrities and royalty, the island of Barbuda is now a disaster zone. Virtually all of its 1,500 residents left for the sister island of Antigua, a 1.5-hour boat ride away, ahead of Jose with assistance from  “The biggest problem in Barbuda now is the fact that you have so many dead animals in the water and so on, that there is a threat of disease. You could put all the people back in Barbuda today ... but then you’ll have a medical crisis on your hand,” Foreign Affairs Minister Charles Fernandez said.  U.K. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson announced a package of 42 million pounds (about $55 million) for the relief effort in the British overseas territories of Anguilla, British Virgin Islands and Turks & Caicos  “The UK government is doing everything it possibly can to help those affected by the hurricane,” he said.  But Anguilla’s former attorney general, Rupert Jones, criticized Britain’s response to the disaster.  “It is an insufficient drop in the Caribbean ocean for islands subject to devastation and inhabited by its own citizens,” he wrote in an email. “The rebuilding effort is bound to cost a vast amount more and it is hard to see this making a real difference to the three islands.”  ___  Weissenstein reported from Havana, Cuba.

Following the record flooding brought on by Hurricane Harvey, tow companies have hauled hundreds of thousands of water-logged vehicles. The storm inflicted an automotive catastrophe on a car-centric city whose dependence on vehicles is likely to slow its recovery. (AP Photo/Scott Mayerowitz)  KATY, Texas (AP) — Bryan Harvey is frequently reminded that he shares a name with the storm that dumped 50 inches of rain on metropolitan Houston and unleashed the floods that have him working 14-hour days towing water-logged cars.  Even in their despair, some victims have salvaged a smile by posing for pictures in front of the “Harvey’s Towing” sign on the side of his red Dodge Ram 5500 flat-bed truck.  More than a week after Harvey slammed Houston, wreckers like Bryan Harvey are still hauling cars and trucks from flooded neighborhoods to dealerships or to vast fields where insurance adjusters can assess the damage. Harvey killed at least 70 people, destroyed or damaged 200,000 homes — and inflicted an automotive catastrophe on one of America’s most car-dependent cities.  The Houston area has lost hundreds of thousands of cars, says Michael Hartmann, general manager of Don McGill Toyota of Katy, a city of 17,000 about 30 miles west of Houston. “We have a shortage of rental cars and people not sure how to go about handling claims and just what to do with their lives.”  The wreckage has forced Houstonians to scramble to try to rent or borrow cars or to work from home — if they can. Some have it worse: They can’t return to work until they resolve the transportation problems, depriving many of them of income and slowing the city’s return to business as usual.  Few American cities depend on cars as much as Houston, but Hurricane Harvey dumped so much rain on the region, 500,000 to 1,000,000 vehicles were damaged or destroyed. (Sept. 9)  ___  WHERE CARS ARE EVERYTHING  Few American cities depend on cars as much as Houston. More than 94 percent of the city’s households have cars, second only to Dallas, the Cox Automotive consultancy says. Houston is even less amenable to walking, bicycle-riding and mass transit than freeway-mad Los Angeles, according to Walk Score, which promotes walkable communities.  Fourteen-lane highways link downtown Houston to its sprawling suburbs. Off-ramps are stacked five-high at some interchanges, inducing vertigo for motorists unschooled in driving Houston-style. Outside the city center, isolated islands of office towers are connected only by concrete and asphalt.  Cars are “everything here,” Hartmann says. “Cars are part of a person’s lifestyle. Most people in our area work 25, 30 miles from home.”  Houston is used to flooding. But it had never seen anything like Harvey, which dropped a year’s worth of rain onto the metro area. Flooded roads and neighborhoods left cars submerged and, in most cases, impossible to salvage.  “Almost every square inch of your vehicle has wires in it,” says Rebecca Lindland, executive analyst at Cox Automotive. “The materials are often flame-retardant, but they are not waterproof.”  Cox estimates that up to 500,000 cars and trucks were damaged or destroyed, amounting to nearly $5 billion in damage. Auto insurance claims have reached 160,000, according to the Insurance Council of Texas. Cars are being taken by the hundreds to a make-shift lot at the 500-acre Royal Purple Raceway in Baytown, about 35 miles east of town. Most of the time, the insurance adjusters shake their heads at the damage Harvey has wrought and declare the cars a total loss.  “Put yourself in the shoes of the adjuster,” says Mark Hanna, a spokesman for the Texas insurance council. “He’s just seen, say, a 2015 Toyota Camry. He knows this vehicle has been underwater for six days. They can look at it, but they know water is all throughout that vehicle. They know it is totaled ... He’s going to see the same vehicle many times.”  Take a 360-degree tour of Houston’s flooded cars  Many insurers are reluctant even to try to repair cars that risk further problems and repairs later.  In the meantime, there’s a desperate shortage of rental cars. Enterprise Holdings, which includes the Enterprise, National and Alamo brands, has moved thousands of vehicles to southeast Texas and plans to have brought in at least 17,000 by the end of September. The Avis Budget Group, which operates Avis and Budget, is moving 10,000 vehicles into the affected areas, waiving late fees, one-way rental fees and rental extension fees in and around Houston.  ___  RETHINKING SUBURBAN SPRAWL?  Tanya Dubose, executive director of the redevelopment council in Houston’s Independence Heights neighborhood, loved her car, a 2010 Chevrolet Equinox with 140,000 miles on it. She kept her files in the backseat, along with paperwork on her family genealogy, a hobby of hers.  “I use my car for everything — to go to meetings, to lug people around,” she says. “It was my office. It had Bluetooth speakers, so I could do business.”  The Equinox has been missing since Harvey hit. The vehicle had been in the shop undergoing work, and the surrounding neighborhood was flooded.  “I have no idea where my car is,” Dubose says.  She can’t reach the mechanic who’d been working on it. Flooded out of her home, she’s been getting rides from friends and has set up shop in a hotel near the George R. Brown Convention Center to help Harvey victims.  In Katy, Ysabel Saez, her partner and three daughters fled their apartment by wading through chest-deep water, leaving behind a Ford Escape sport utility and an F-150 pickup. Both had been swamped. Her Escape was insured; her partner’s pickup wasn’t. Without a ride, he’s been unable to get to his job at an audio-visual company near the George Bush International Airport, over 40 miles away.  “We were doing fine,” says Saez, who works as a nanny. “Now we’re so behind. We want to get back to where we were.”  Urban planners, like Kyle Shelton of Rice University in Houston, say the city and its suburbs were ill-prepared for a storm like Harvey.  “We’ve lost 500,000 to 1 million cars,” he says. “How are those people getting around now?”  Bus and train service is limited, especially in suburban areas such as Sugar Land, which never joined the region’s transit authority. The region would benefit if people were living closer together rather than spread out over 2,000 square miles as they are now.  “Denser places would be more easily served and better connected to emergency services,” says Shelton, director of strategic partnerships at Rice’s Kinder Institute for Urban Research, who wonders whether Harvey will change attitudes toward suburban sprawl and the area’s dependence on cars.  Hartmann at the Toyota dealership is skeptical: “I don’t think it will change anything.” Car culture runs too deep.  ___  CARS LIKE BOATS  These days, Bryan Harvey, who runs a one-man towing operation, starts work at 7 a.m. and gets home after 9 p.m. Cellphones and police scanners let him know when someone needs a tow. The phone rings.  “I’m coming that-away,” he says en route to a drenched Kia Rio.  As Harvey tows the Kia, Jessica Kong mentions that it’s the third car her family has lost to the storm. An employee for a billing company, she’s been working from home. Others in her household have borrowed cars from family and friends to get around.  “Good thing we have a lot of family,” she says.  Harvey pulls away in search of another stranded, water-logged car.  Sporting a tattoo, a knee brace and crucifix necklace, Harvey maneuvers his truck through Katy’s muddy residential streets, past homes where mattresses, drywall and other debris are piled up on what used to be neat suburban lawns. In some places, the streets remain filled with a foot or more of water. Harvey drives cautiously to protect his truck and avoid swamping other vehicles in his wake.  Other motorists aren’t so careful and stall in the flooded streets.  “Houstonians think their cars are boats,” he says. “It’s a recurring thing. They are attracted to it like bugs to light.”  Harvey has car problems of his own. His youngest daughter was flooded out of her home and is living at his place. She also lost her car.

Asian stocks rose strongly Monday after Hurricane Irma weakened and North Korea marked a weekend holiday with celebrations but refrained from launching more missiles, giving investors some relief. (AP Photo/Vincent Yu)  LONDON (AP) — Global stock markets rallied and the dollar strengthened Monday as investors breathed a sigh of relief that Hurricane Irma, which has caused so much devastation in the Caribbean and in Florida, was weakening and that North Korea refrained from any potentially antagonistic move during a weekend holiday.  KEEPING SCORE: In Europe, Germany’s DAX was up 1.1 percent at 12,435 while the CAC 40 in France rose 1.1 percent to 5,167. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was 0.3 percent higher at 7,401. U.S. stocks were poised for a solid opening with Dow futures and the broader S&P 500 futures 0.5 percent higher.  PYONGYANG PARTY: North Koreans observed the country’s 69th founding anniversary with celebrations that included laying flowers and bowing at statues and portraits of past leaders. But Pyongyang did not carry out another test of an intercontinental ballistic missile, as South Korea’s government had warned it might do. Attention now moves to the United Nations, where the United States has called for a vote later Monday on new sanctions.  STORMY WEATHER: Investors were waiting for damage assessments after Hurricane Irma battered Florida’s coastline, knocking out power to millions and flooding the financial district in downtown Miami and toppling two construction cranes there. The storm was now headed for the heavily populated Tampa-St. Petersburg area, though in a weakened state. Irma was a Category 5 storm when it battered Cuba but weakened to Category 1 after hitting Florida.  MARKET INSIGHT: “Traders have started the new week hungry for risk, pushing equities and base metals higher on reduced concerns about North Korea and Hurricane Irma,” said Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets.

Canadian mining company Eldorado Gold on Monday threatened to suspend a major investment in Greece in ten days, accusing the government of delaying permits and licenses. (AP Photo/Petros Giannakouris)  ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Canadian mining company Eldorado Gold on Monday threatened to suspend a major investment in Greece in 10 days, accusing the government of delaying permits and licenses.  One of Greece’s largest foreign investors, Eldorado operates mines in northern Greece that have faced vehement opposition from parts of local communities on environmental grounds, with protests often turning violent.  “This decision is not one that we have taken lightly,” Eldorado President and CEO George Burns told reporters in Athens, noting the company has made a $3 billion-investment in the country.  A company announcement said it would continue maintenance and environmental safeguards, but would make no further investment in three mines in the Halkidiki area of northern Greece and two projects in the northeastern province of Thrace.  It said the permit delays “have negatively impacted Eldorado’s project schedules and costs, ultimately hindering the company’s ability to effectively advance development and operation of these assets.”  Burns said the company’s decision will take effect on Sept. 21 unless Eldorado receives the permits.  “Approvals must not be held hostage to political posturing or other agendas put forward by a vocal minority,” he said. “I keep hearing the permits are coming, but they’re not coming in a timely fashion.”  But Environment Minister Giorgos Stathakis said European and national law had to be upheld, and that the company had still not completed all necessary procedures, including completing an investment plan detailing production methods.  He also said some pending permits were scheduled to be given in mid-September for six months, allowing the company to operate during the arbitration process.  “The company’s choices toward the employees are clearly their responsibility,” Stathakis said. “We are witnesses of an extraordinary event, of a company that through its CEO holds press conferences and makes statements judging prime ministers, ministers and political parties in Greece.”  Burns said the company was unable to legally continue work without the permits, adding he was open to dialogue and hoped to have the issue resolved in time.  This is not the first time Eldorado has suspended operations in Greece. In January 2016, it had threatened to suspend work at one of its sites and lay off 600 workers following protests by local residents and a spat with the government. Work restarted several months later.  Burns said he had sent three letters to Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras during the last five months, since he took over the helm of Eldorado, but had not received any reply.  Eldorado employs some 2,400 staff and contractors in Greece through its local subsidiary, Hellas Gold. The company said 90 percent of the workers faced being suspended temporarily from their jobs if the permits don’t come through in time.  The company took over old mines in 2012, paying nearly $2 billion. Burns said it had since invested a further $1 billion in Greece, a figure which would double if the company could fully develop its assets in Greece.  Monday’s action comes as Greece struggles to emerge from years of a deep financial crisis and attract investment.  Interior Minister Panos Skourletis said disagreements would be resolved through arbitration. The company, however, counters it has not been officially informed of what the arbitration would be about.  “This might be a move to (exert) political pressure on the government at a crucial time,” Skourletis said.  He insisted Greece was friendly toward foreign investments, but that the Canadian project, being a mining operation, was a special case.  “Such kinds of investments no longer exist in the rest of Europe. They’re not allowed due to the great environmental cost they have,” he said. “So it’s wrong to connect this particular case with the general picture in the area of investments (in Greece).”  The Halkidiki mines have been mired in controversy for decades, with Eldorado’s predecessors also facing protests.  Many in the local communities vehemently oppose mining development on environmental grounds, saying it would hurt the area’s tourism industry, destroy forests risk contaminating the groundwater.  The company counters it’s carrying out environmental cleanup work even of its predecessors, and rejects accusations of pollution. It noted that Greece’s Council of State, the country’s highest administrative court, had issued 18 decisions in its favor in various permit disputes.  Burns said he remained optimistic that a solution could be found. “I’m confident these mines will be built,” he said.  When first elected on an anti-bailout platform in 2015, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’ left-wing government initially favored the suspension of the permits that had previously been granted to the mining company.  Greece’s confederation of industries urged Tsipras to personally intervene to rescue the gold mine investment.  Nikos Panairlis, head of the workers’ union at one of the mines, described the company’s move as “a catastrophe for us,” adding that workers were looking to organize protests.  The mood among opponents of the mine was cautious. Aristotelis municipality mayor Giorgos Zoumbas accused Eldorado of “using the workers and their jobs to blackmail and get the permits.”  Local residents, he said, would be happy if the suspension goes ahead, “but they’re still cautious.”  ___  Derek Gatopoulos in Athens and Costas Kantouris in Thessaloniki, Greece contributed to this report.  ___  Follow Becatoros http://www.twitter.com/ElenaBec",1.75,2,"[1.0, 2.5]"
127,778,9,12,2017,2017-09-12,Associated Press News,"Left out of health debate, Appalachian poor seek free care"," They arrived at a fairground in a deep corner of Appalachia before daybreak, hundreds of people with throbbing teeth, failing eyes, wheezing lungs. They took a number, sat in the bleachers and waited in the summer heat for their name to be called so they could receive the medical help they can’t get anywhere else.  Among the visitors at the free, once-a-year medical clinic was Lisa Kantsos, whose first stop was the dental tent, a sprawl of tables and chairs where volunteer dentists and students performed cleanings, filled cavities and pulled teeth. After getting a cleaning, she made a stop at a mammography van. Last year, it was free glasses.  “It’s a blessing. It really is,” said Kantsos, a 52-year-old diabetic, “because I don’t have to worry about these things.”  Kantsos and many of the estimated 2,000 others who turned out at the Wise County Fairgrounds in late July are the health care debate’s forgotten.  Even with the passage of “Obamacare” in 2010, they have no insurance because they exist in a desperate in-between zone, unable to afford coverage but ineligible for Medicaid. And because they haven’t benefited from the Affordable Care Act, the debate on Capitol Hill over repealing it has been all but irrelevant to them.  The sick and poor in Appalachia are flocking to free health clinics. They’ve been left out of the health care debate in Washington. At a recent clinic in southwestern Virginia, hundreds came for much needed treatments. (Sept. 12)  “Whether there was an Affordable Care Act or not, it really hasn’t made any difference for these people,” said Stan Brock, who founded the free traveling Remote Area Medical Clinic in the 1980s.  The need for better, more affordable care around here is undeniable.  The central Appalachian area that includes eastern Kentucky, southern West Virginia and western Virginia has long been one of the sickest and poorest regions in the country. More recently, it has been ravaged by the decline of coal mining.  “Everything revolved around coal,” said Matt Sutherland, a frequent visitor to the clinic from Castlewood, Virginia. “Now there’s not a lot of work, not a lot for people to do.”  People in central Appalachia are 41 percent more likely to get diabetes and 42 percent more likely to die of heart disease than the rest of the nation, according to a study released in August by the Appalachian Regional Commission and other groups. The study also found that the region’s supply of specialty doctors per 100,000 people is 65 percent lower than in the rest of the nation.  And people from southwestern Virginia die on average 10 years sooner than those from wealthier counties close to Washington, said August Wallmeyer, an author who lobbies the Virginia legislature on health issues.  Opioids are also taking their toll in Appalachia. In Virginia in 2014, drug overdoses became the No. 1 cause of accidental death, according to Wallmeyer’s 2016 book, “The Extremes of Virginia.”  But Virginia was among 19 states that chose not to expand Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act. Many states cited the cost, even though Washington pledged to pick up nearly the entire expense. An expansion in Virginia would have covered an additional 400,000 people.  “A lot of people, when the Affordable Care Act was first enacted and went into effect, had the mistaken belief that it was going to help the very poor people, particularly in Appalachia and other parts of Virginia,” Wallmeyer said. “And it’s just not true.”  Wallmeyer said the clinic in Wise County doesn’t see as many patients as it once did from Kentucky, a state that expanded Medicaid under the ACA.  Teresa Gardner Tyson, executive director of Virginia’s Health Wagon, a free clinic that takes part in the Wise event, lamented that the politicians “forget at the end of the day that they’re our servants.”  “They can’t get away from the partisan politics, but here we’re faced with people dying on a daily basis,” she said.  Among the patients at the free clinic was Joey Johnson, who shot himself in the head while playing with a gun when he was a teenager and has been in a wheelchair for 25 years.  No longer receiving health benefits from his stepfather’s union miner’s insurance, he came to the clinic to get a dental filling and have his eyes checked. His Medicaid doesn’t pay for dental check-ups, and he gets just $735 a month in federal disability payments and $20 in food stamps.  “If it wasn’t for this (clinic), my teeth would rot out of my head and I would be in bad shape,” he said before his checkup, sitting shirtless in the heat. Johnson’s assessment of lawmakers’ work on health care is more succinct than any tweet: “They don’t care about us.”  Kantsos voted for Donald Trump last fall in the hope that he could shake up Washington. She said the president needs to concentrate more on his job and less on Twitter.  Sutherland supported Trump, too, and said he thinks the president deserves more time. But Sutherland, who comes to the clinic for dental work and medicine, wishes lawmakers understood how hard life can be in Appalachia. Last year, he said, he walked 30 miles (50 kilometers) to the Wise clinic because he had no car; it took more than seven hours. Others have it bad, too.  “I’m not the only one,” he said, sitting in a tent where people were getting teeth pulled a few feet away. “I’m really not the only one.”  ___  Follow Dylan Lovan on Twitter at https://twitter.com/dylanlovan",3.25,2,"[3.0, 3.5]"

Aiming to get an edge on its rivals in an intensely competitive industry, Japanese automaker Nissan says it’s attempting to foster a corporate culture that will produce manufacturing innovations in leaps and bounds instead of steady incremental improvement. Its discussion of that effort is partly a swipe at bigger competitor Toyota Motor Corp. which for decades has favored the concept of “kaizen” or fine tuning and bit-by-bit progress in auto manufacturing. (AP Photo/Shizuo Kambayashi)  YOKOHAMA, Japan (AP) — Aiming to get an edge on its rivals in an intensely competitive industry, Japanese automaker Nissan says it’s attempting to foster a corporate culture that will produce manufacturing innovations in leaps and bounds instead of steady incremental improvement.  Its discussion of that effort is partly a swipe at bigger competitor Toyota Motor Corp. which for decades has favored the concept of “kaizen” or fine-tuning and bit-by-bit progress in auto manufacturing.  Kaizen has earned Japanese automakers good marks for reliability and quality and Toyota practically defined it as its “way,” emphasizing daily effort by everyone from the lowest assembly worker to the chief executive. But Nissan Motor Co. says it is implementing novel manufacturing methods and has dozens of ideas in its development pipeline.  “The old-style kaizen gives you a 5 percent, maybe a 10 percent, improvement. But our team’s goal is what we call ‘kakushin,’ to deliver change that’s a multiple of the previous,” said Atsuhiko Hayakawa, a corporate vice president who heads powertrain production at Nissan.  In an example at Nissan’s Yokohama plant, shown to The Associated Press, a coating technology made the metal liner of a cylinder block of an engine about the tenth of its previous thickness, from 2 millimeters (0.08 inches) to 0.2 millimeters (0.01 inches).  Instead of trying to reduce the cast-iron layer’s thickness, bit by bit, a totally new approach was tried, spraying on molten iron, said Hayakawa who speaks with a passionate intensity rare for corporate Japan.  The metal liner technology has already been introduced for the GT-R sports car, but is now being expanded to other models, such as the Pathfinder sport-utility vehicle, Infiniti QX60 luxury SUV and the new Kicks global compact crossover, including production in Mexico and China.  It’s now used for nearly half a million vehicles a year, or about 7 percent of Nissan’s annual global production, and that will keep growing, according to Nissan.  Among other examples: Finishing a surface to a mirror polish to reduce friction in a part. A triple coating reduced to a single coating.  They all translate into cuts in investments, costs and preparation time for manufacturing, as well as a better product, according to Hayakawa.  The production initiatives are getting rolled out throughout Nissan’s alliance, which includes Renault SA of France, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. of Japan, as well as more limited partnerships with other manufacturers around the world.  It’s true that the kaizen efforts shown at Toyota plants can appear primitive to the eye, such as using gravity to shuttle objects and save on energy costs or rearranging the position of equipment on the plant floor.  But it has many proponents and has been adopted outside the automotive industry in areas such as hospitals and warehouses.  Yavuz Bozer, engineering professor at the University of Michigan who advises companies on “lean manufacturing,” said developments in the materials, artificial intelligence, 3-D printers and other advances open up potential for a revolution in manufacturing but that doesn’t make Kaizen obsolete.  Toyota said the pursuit for the “ever better” way remained vibrant at its plants and offices.  “One can take up new challenges, but one can also simultaneously do daily kaizen,” said spokeswoman Kayo Doi, while declining comment on other companies.  Koichi Murata, associate professor at Nihon University and an expert on lean manufacturing, believes the value of kaizen is not just measured in optimized efficiency, but also in how workers’ lives are enriched.  “It is about making someone’s work more fun and creative. And that has not changed, in the past, now, or for the future. It’s about the workers on the ground,” said Murata.  ___  Follow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama  Her work can be found at https://www.apnews.com/search/yuri%20kageyama",1.6666666666666667,3,"[3.5, 1.0, 0.5]"

(AP Photo/Lee Jin-man)  SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Samsung Electronics Co. said Tuesday it aims to launch a foldable smartphone next year under its Galaxy Note brand.  Koh Dong-jin, president of mobile business at Samsung Electronics, said the company is setting its eyes on 2018 to release a smartphone with a bendable display. But he said there are several hurdles it has to overcome, leaving room to push back the release if those problems are not solved.  “As the head of the business, I can say our current goal is next year,” he told reporters. “When we can overcome some problems for sure, we will launch the product.”  He did not elaborate what the problems are. Analysts said mass-producing a foldable phone with top tech features and a thin body will take time.  When Samsung will release its first foldable phone has been a perennial question in the market since Samsung first showcased a flexible display prototype called Youm in 2013. For at least the past two years, there have been rumors that Samsung is close to showing off its first smartphones that can be folded.  Koh also said the company is working with auto-systems maker Harman to develop an artificial intelligence-enabled speaker that users can speak to in order to play music and conduct other tasks. Samsung acquired the Stamford, Connecticut-based company last year as part of its plans to expand in the emerging market for connected cars.  Amazon and Google already have those always-on voice-controlled speakers in the market while Apple’s Homepod is due to go on sale later this year. It is not clear when Samsung’s voice-controlled speaker, which will likely use the South Korean company’s Bixby voice assistant, will be unveiled. Koh did not say when it will hit the market.  The comments were made at Samsung’s news conference to announce the Galaxy Note 8 smartphone to domestic media, just hours before Apple announces its 10th-anniversary iPhone models.  Samsung’s mobile president said market response to the Note 8 beat its expectations even though its price was more expensive than past models and even as the Note brand’s reputation took a hit from its previous model, the disgraced Note 7 phone that was recalled twice and discontinued after it spontaneously overheated or caught fire.  Samsung received more than a half million pre-orders — 650,000 units — for the Note 8 in South Korea before its Friday launch, Koh said.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein, File)  BEIJING (AP) — The founder of a Chinese online peer-to-peer lender has been sentenced to life in prison on charges he defrauded investors of $7.7 billion in one of China’s biggest financial scams.  Ezubo was the biggest competitor in an informal finance industry that Chinese authorities allowed to flourish with little oversight over the past decade to support entrepreneurs who cannot get loans from state banks. A series of lenders have collapsed as economic growth slowed, leaving authorities struggling to defuse protests by depositors.  Ezubo’s founder, Ding Ning, and his younger brother, Ding Dian, were sentenced Tuesday to life by the Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People’s Court for “fundraising fraud,” according to the official Xinhua News Agency.  It said another 24 executives were sentenced to prison terms ranging from three to 15 years.  Two companies affiliated with Ezubo were fined a total of 1.9 billion yuan ($291 million), Xinhua said. It said some defendants also were convicted of offenses including smuggling precious metals and illegal gun possession.  Regulators seized Ezubo in December 2015 on charges of taking deposits without a license. Xinhua said authorities have confiscated the company’s assets to repay depositors but gave no indication how much money was recovered.  Regulators allowed private sector lending to support entrepreneurs who create China’s new jobs and wealth but are largely shut out of lending by the state-owned banking industry. The national bank regulator estimated in 2015 the industry had grown to $1.5 trillion.  Beijing tightened control as defaults mounted following the 2008 financial crisis. The finance industry as a whole has come under tougher scrutiny after a plunge in stock prices in 2015 led to accusations of insider trading and other offenses.  Ding, 34, was a high school dropout who worked at his mother’s hardware factory, where he gained experience running online sales, according to media reports. With no technical or financial training, Ding launched Ezubo in July 2014 and opened marketing offices across China.  Ezubo appeared to gain Beijing’s endorsement when the Cabinet website, gov.cn, published an interview with Ding discussing his life as an entrepreneur. That interview has since been removed.  The seizure of Ezubo prompted protests by depositors who complained the government failed to protect them.  Depositors traveled to Beijing to protest at government offices and the headquarters of state television, which had broadcast advertisements for Ezubo.  Ezubo attracted deposits by promising returns of 9 to 14.6 percent, according to investigators. But authorities say a former executive admitted 95 percent of those borrowers were fictional entities created by Ezubo. In a confession broadcast by state television in February 2016, the executive called the company “a fraud ... a typical Ponzi scheme.”  The court said Ding and other defendants “inflicted huge losses on investors in many parts of China and disrupted the national financial management system,” according to Xinhua.  The internet has helped lenders attract money from working class or rural depositors, many of them financial novices with little knowledge of the risks involved.  After Ezubo depositors poured out their anger on Chinese social media, police phoned some internet users to warn them against criticizing the Communist Party online.  One investor from northeastern China who lost 480,000 yuan ($76,000) told The Associated Press that police confiscated her computer and cell phone after she posted online that she might file a petition with the central government.  Earlier, two businesswomen in southern China were sentenced to death in 2012 and 2013 in separate cases on charges of “illegal fundraising.” The penalty for the first was converted to a prison term following an outcry online that it was too severe.",3.5,2,"[3.5, 3.5]"

Embattled Toshiba Corp. needs the sale of its lucrative NAND flash-memory SanDisk joint venture to survive. But Western Digital has begun legal action, opposing the sale to anyone else.  Toshiba sank into the red for the fiscal year through March. Its money-losing nuclear business in the U.S., Westinghouse Electric Co., filed for bankruptcy protection in March.

But Western Digital protested within hours of the announcement.  “We are disappointed that Toshiba would take this action despite Western Digital’s tireless efforts to reach a resolution that is in the best interests of all stakeholders,” it said in a statement, stressing that it has also offered many proposals.

Bain has now come up with a new proposal, it said, while noting other negotiations were also ongoing.  “Toshiba intends to reach a definitive agreement that fully meets our objectives at the earlier possible date,” Senior Executive Vice President Yasuo Naruke said.  Western Digital, which bought SanDisk last year, has argued the sale might violate terms of the joint venture with Toshiba. Such sales can be sensitive because they involve the transfer of technology.  Toshiba had said in June its preferred bidder was the Bain consortium, which also includes Innovation Network Corp. of Japan and the Development Bank of Japan, for the sale of the unit called Toshiba Memory Corp.  But after Western Digital opposed the move, it said it was talking to others.  Toshiba’s massive red ink began with the reactors it has been building in the U.S., which are still unfinished, partly because of beefed up safety regulations following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster.  Bain Capital Private Equity, based in Boston, is one of the world’s leading investment firms. The Development Bank of Japan is backed by the government of Japan. The Innovation Network Corp. of Japan is made up of 26 big-name Japanese corporate investors, including Sony Corp., Canon Inc., Toyota Motor Corp. and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.  Toshiba’s earnings reports initially failed to get endorsements from its auditors, meaning that it could have been delisted.  But the auditors finally signed off in August after an investigation that centered on whether Toshiba had known in advance the subsequent losses that emerged related to Westinghouse’s acquisition of CB&I Stone & Webster, a nuclear construction and services business.  In 2015, Toshiba acknowledged it had been systematically falsifying its books since 2008, as managers tried to meet overly ambitious targets. An outside investigation found profits had been inflated and expenses hidden across the board.  ___  AP Business Writer Yuri Kageyama can be reached at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama  Her work can be found at https://www.apnews.com/search/yuri%20kageyama",2.75,2,"[2.5, 3.0]"

Victims of Harvey, desperate to rebuild their homes and lives, are facing the harsh reality that it may take months for an overwhelmed construction industry to address their needs. (AP Photo/David J. Phillip)  With floodwaters nearing knee height, Arlene Estle fled to the upstairs of the Houston house where she’s lived for 50 years and raised four children. It was many hours later before her son-in-law arrived by boat to rescue her.  Her flooded home didn’t fare so well. It could be a year, her contractor warned her, before she can return. Until then, she’ll have to find some place to rent.  “I’m going to be 83,” Estle said one recent morning as her daughter and housekeeper helped try to disinfect her belongings. “This is just a life-changing thing for me to face with making so many decisions. It’s just overwhelming.”  Estle is among the fortunate ones. She has flood insurance and a longtime contractor who can start work soon. Most victims of Harvey have neither. Months will be spent struggling to assess damage, navigate federal assistance and apply for loans. Then, victims will have to compete for contractors who have already put prospective clients on waiting lists.  All told, it could take years for some people to rebuild, if they can do it at all. The same could be true of many victims of Hurricane Irma, which caused its own catastrophic damage in Florida, though less than initially feared.

Try viewing this in a modern browser like Chrome, Safari, Firefox or Internet Explorer 9 or later.  For anyone who needs to repair or rebuild a home or business, the back-to-back hurricanes coincided with a national shortage of carpenters, electricians, drywall installers and other skilled workers. Many construction workers left the industry after the housing bubble burst a decade ago and haven’t returned.  With fewer younger workers entering the business, the average age of some construction trades has reached well into middle age. There were 255,000 unfilled construction sector jobs recorded in June, according to the National Association of Home Builders.  On top of the worker shortage, homeowners will pay elevated prices for materials, which had already been rising this year.  “The labor shortage is going to make this take longer, but more importantly, it’s going to be more expensive than people think because labor rates are going to go up dramatically,” said John Burns, CEO of John Burns Real Estate Consulting, a housing industry research firm.  Few construction companies outside Texas and Florida are eager or equipped to travel there to handle rebuilding. Most are already busy on work closer to home.  “Why would I take a chance on going to Florida or the Gulf Coast for temporary work, where I might not be able to find housing, when I can find steady employment here and now?” said Ken Simonson, chief economist for the Associated General Contractors of America.  In Texas, Harvey compounded a heavy demand for housing. Texas had been on pace for 30,000 housing starts in 2017. Now, an estimated 200,000 more homes suddenly need to be repaired or rebuilt. Construction jobs were already taking one or two months longer than usual, said Scott Norman of the Texas Association of Builders.  Nearly 70 percent of Texas contractors had trouble finding concrete workers, electricians, cement masons and carpenters, according to a survey of construction firms that the Associated General Contractors of America conducted in July. Texas has long struggled to replenish its aging construction workforce. The average age of a master electrician in Texas is 59. For plumbers, it’s 62.  Stephen McNiel of Creative Property Restoration, a remodeling firm in Houston, received calls from seven flood victims on the day he visited longtime client whose recently restored home had been ruined by Harvey. One came from a woman who had phoned dozens of contractors. All warned her it would be months before they could take on additional work.  “There is a tremendous amount of demand — far more than I’m capable of handling and than everyone I know in my industry is capable of handling,” McNiel said.  McNiel said he could use 50 percent more workers but is struggling to find subcontractors. He said he worries that the shortage of skilled labor is being exacerbated by a perceived suspicion of immigrants under President Donald Trump.  “The reality of my industry is that most of the work gets done by immigrants,” McNiel said.  Simonson noted Trump’s decision to phase out the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which grants a reprieve from deportation to nearly 800,000 immigrants brought to the U.S. as children.  “Texas, more than ever, needs people with construction skills from any country,” he said.  Victims of the storms can first expect delays in having their property assessed for damage by insurance adjusters. Then, securing financing will become a challenge. Flood insurance coverage has declined in both Texas and Florida as premiums have risen. Many homeowners will have to go into debt or dig into savings to make repairs — or sell their properties.  For homes that have sat the longest in feet-deep water, drywall and insulation will need to be stripped down to studs and dried. Then everything from wooden flooring to electrical systems and interior doors must be rebuilt.  Mary and Duane Hendricks, retirees who live a few streets from Estle, have decided to give up on their home, now flooded for the second time in two years. They still face a prolonged repair process in hopes of selling it. The Hendrickses have begun removing Sheetrock and flooring to prevent mold.  Two years ago, they tried to live in their home while it was being repaired for flood damage and ended up moving out after three months. This time, they arranged a rental even before the hurricane hit. If they can’t sell, they will just walk away from the home they bought in 1971, where they raised two children and built a sunroom where they taught yoga in retirement.  “We cannot go back,” said Mary Hendricks. “It’s a beautiful home, and we’ve had it for years and we’ve done a lot of work on it. That’s the heartbreaking part.”  In Florida, the magnitude of damage from Irma is still coming into focus. But the widespread flooding means Florida will have to compete with Texas for many of the same materials and laborers. Irma spread its destruction over a vast territory, covering all of Florida and causing major damage to Georgia as well.  “It isn’t just a few counties — it did damage in county after county,” said Douglas Buck of the Florida Home Builders Association. “That’s going to make it more difficult for contractors and builders to go where the problem is and help rebuild communities.”  In Houston, Estle’s contractor, Dan Bawden, urged her to seek a yearlong rental while her house gets fixed. Bawden foresees months of delays in obtaining drywall, interior doors, siding, trim moldings, ceramic tile, cabinets and plywood.  Even before the storm hit, his remodeling firm had a six-month backlog of projects. Now, with eight full-time employees, he’s “overwhelmed with more calls coming in that we can respond to.” Prospective clients must get on a waiting list.  As Harvey approached, Bawden rushed to secure his network of 60 contractors, knowing they would soon be pulled in different directions. He worries that six months from now, “they are going to want to charge more or go work for someone else.”  Florida is no more equipped than Texas to handle a surge of construction demand. Miami still hasn’t recovered all the construction jobs lost in the recession. The metro area, which also includes Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach, had 130,000 construction workers in August, compared with 168,000 in 2006.  “In our economy, money talks,” Simonson said. “People who have the most urgent need in some cases will be able to buy their way to the front of the line.”  ___  Olson reported from New York, Veiga from Los Angeles.  ___  Associated Press Writer Paul Wiseman in Washington contributed to this report.  ___  HURRICANE NEWSLETTER - Get the best of the AP’s all-formats reporting on Irma and Harvey in your inbox: http://apne.ws/ahYQGtb",4.0,2,"[3.0, 5.0]"
144,874,9,13,2017,2017-09-13,Associated Press News,Sanders would make government health care role even bigger,"Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is joined by Democratic Senators and supporters as he arrives for a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Sept. 13, 2017, to unveil their Medicare for All legislation to reform health care. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)  WASHINGTON (AP) — In an animated, campaign-style rally, Sen. Bernie Sanders unwrapped his plan to remake the nation’s convoluted health care system into federally run health insurance Wednesday — a costly proposal embraced by liberal activists hoping to steer the Democratic Party in upcoming elections.  The Vermont independent’s plan would hand government a dominant role in insuring Americans, a crucial step, he said, in guaranteeing health care for all. Census Bureau data this week showed the proportion of people lacking policies falling to 8.8 percent last year under “Obamacare,” the lowest level ever recorded, but he called it an “international disgrace” that not all Americans have coverage.  Though Sanders’ plan is going nowhere in the current GOP-controlled Congress, he drew a big crowd to a packed and electrified Senate hearing room.  Hours earlier, Republican senators unveiled their own last-ditch, long-shot plan to scuttle President Barack Obama’s 2010 statute and practically begged the White House to help.  “Pick up the phone” and ask governors to support the repeal effort, said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., aiming his remarks at President Donald Trump. “Tell them this matters to you, that you weren’t kidding about repealing and replacing Obamacare, that you actually meant it.”  Sen. Bernie Sanders is proposing legislation that would let Americans get health coverage simply by showing a new government-issued card. And they'd no longer owe out-of-pocket expenses like deductibles. (Sept. 13)  Shortly afterward, Trump issued a statement saying “I sincerely hope” the effort by Graham and three other GOP senators will succeed.  The waning desire of GOP lawmakers to revive their failed effort to scrap Obama’s law contrasted with growing, though wary, Democratic support for Sanders’ bill. It has attracted 16 co-sponsors, one-third of all Senate Democrats, though most are from safely Democratic states.  “Today we begin the long and difficult struggle to end the international disgrace of the United States, our great nation, being the only major country on Earth not to guarantee health care to all,” Sanders declared.  Though his bill has no chance in the current Congress, the issue is enthusiastically backed by large segments of a Democratic Party hoping to capture House control in the 2018 elections. Sanders caucuses with Democrats and unexpectedly gave Hillary Clinton a tough run for the party’s presidential nomination last year.  The room where Sanders spoke held more than 200 people, including members of unions and progressive groups. Many waved posters and chanted “Medicare for all,” the name he has given his 96-page bill, which would gradually expand the health insurance program for the elderly to cover all Americans.  Nine other senators attended and most also spoke, including at least four potential 2020 presidential aspirants who almost seemed to be auditioning. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., called the health care battle “a fight for our nation to live up to our ideals.”  Cries for universal coverage and government-provided, single-payer health care have simmered among Democrats for decades.  The notion was submerged as Obama enacted his overhaul, which boosted federal spending and set coverage requirements but left much of the existing private system in place. About 156 million people get policies at work, about half of all those insured, with most of the rest getting coverage through Medicare or Medicaid or by buying individual plans.  But support among Democrats for Sanders’ bill and similar measures by other Democrats, plus polling showing growing public backing, suggests the push for a single-payer system will be a major theme inside the party.  “We will defend it at every turn,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., another possible presidential hopeful, told the crowd about Obama’s law. “But we will go further.” Potential candidates Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Kamala Harris of California also attended the event.  Sanders provided no details about the price tag of his measure or how it would be financed. Aides have said it would likely rely largely on income-adjusted premiums people would pay the government, ranging from zero for the poorest Americans to high levies on the rich and corporations.  People would no longer owe monthly premiums and other out-of-pocket costs like copayments, and companies would not have to offer coverage to workers. Sanders says most people and employers would save money.  The version he introduced during his 2016 presidential run was supposed to cost an enormous $1.4 trillion annually.  His plan would surpass Obama’s law in covering a long list of services, including dental, vision, hospital, doctors and mental health costs. Copayments would be allowed for prescription drugs.  Many Democrats from politically competitive states have shied away from Sanders’ plan, aware that Republicans are ready to cast it as a huge tax hike and government-run health care.  “The president as well as the majority of the country knows that the single-payer system that the Democrats are proposing is a horrible idea,” said White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders. “I can’t think of anything worse than having government being more involved in your health care instead of less involved.”  Meanwhile, Graham and three other GOP senators released details of their proposal to erase many of the subsidies and coverage requirements of Obama’s law and instead give block grants to states to help individuals pay for coverage.  “If you believe repealing and replacing Obamacare is a good idea, this is your best and only chance to make it happen because everything else has failed,” Graham said.  Republicans lost the votes of three of their 52 senators in July on legislation aimed at Obamacare repeal. A special budget procedure that’s allowed them to approve the legislation with just 51 votes, instead of the usual 60, expires Sept. 30.  With Democrats all opposed, that gives Republicans barely two weeks to succeed.  ___  AP reporter Kevin Freking contributed to this report.",2.5,2,"[4.5, 0.5]"

Apple fans who froze their credit after the Equifax data breach may end up with another hassle on their hands if they try to get one of the new iPhones that can cost more than $1,000. People who did so and want to make any big purchase may find the same. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File)  NEW YORK (AP) — Apple fans who froze their credit after the Equifax data breach may end up with another hassle on their hands if they try to get one of the new iPhones that can cost more than $1,000. People who rushed to lock down their credit and want to make any other big purchases may find the same inconveniences.  Since Equifax disclosed that 143 million Americans had their Social Security numbers and other personal data hacked, experts have encouraged people who may affected to put in place what’s known as a credit freeze. That locks down a person’s credit from being stolen by identity thieves — but could also mean delays and more fees for Equifax victims who want to finance a new phone.  You can unfreeze your credit before a big purchase and freeze it again afterward. How long it will take and how much it costs vary state by state. Experts say generally it’s best to give the major credit bureaus — TransUnion, Experian and Equifax — notice of several hours or even a few days before you apply for financing. And people just getting used to the idea of freezing their credit could pay $3 to $10 for each action at each of the three bureaus.  Payment plans are a growing business for the major wireless carriers, many of which no longer subsidize a customer’s purchase, because a monthly payment makes an expensive smartphone more affordable. And Apple and the wireless carriers often need access to your credit report in order to approve the sale of a new phone under a monthly plan.  “But if you are someone who has frozen their credit record, you may suddenly discover that you can’t afford an iPhone X, after all,” said Patrick Moorhead, an industry analyst with Moor & Insights.  Providence, Rhode Island-based Citizens Financial Group, which runs the Apple financing program, said any new or existing customer who has a credit freeze on their information will be declined financing. So they would have to unfreeze their credit, at least temporarily. Sprint, Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T run credit checks with the agencies for new customers. Policies vary for existing customers.  Analysts say two-year financing plans have become essential to selling high-end smartphones. International Data Corp. analyst Ramon Llamas called them “critical.” Moorhead expects virtually everyone interested in the new iPhone X, which rolls out later this year, to use an installment plan.  Apple rolled out its program two years ago that lets customers upgrade to a new phone each year and divides the cost of the phone into a monthly payment. The company doesn’t share details on how many customers finance their phones through Citizens/Apple instead of their carriers, and declined to disclose how many of its iPhones are financed.  For other carriers, it’s clearly big business. AT&T sold 3.58 million smartphones to customers under payment plans last quarter, according to its most recent filing. Verizon customers financed $14.51 billion in smartphones under the company’s payment plan in the first six months of 2017, and roughly half its customers who pay a cellphone bill at the end of each month are on a payment plan.  The Verizon and AT&T figures include sales of both iPhones and other smartphones like Samsung, which has a larger worldwide share of the smartphone market than Apple. But iPhones generally cost more than phones by other makers — roughly $685 compared to the $340 average price of a Samsung phone — so analysts think a greater share of iPhone customers may finance theirs.  ____  Liedtke reported from San Francisco.

On Monday, Sept. 11, 2017, Equifax said it has made changes to address customer complaints since it disclosed a week earlier that it exposed vital data on about 143 million Americans. Equifax has come under fire from members of Congress, state attorneys general, and people who are getting conflicting answers about whether their information was stolen. Equifax is trying again to clarify language about people’s right to sue, and said Monday it has made changes to address customer complaints. (AP Photo/Mike Stewart, File)  NEW YORK (AP) — Credit agency Equifax traced the theft of sensitive information about 143 million Americans to a software flaw that could have been fixed well before the burglary occurred, further undermining its credibility as the guardian of personal data that can easily be used for identity theft.  Equifax identified a weakness in an open-source software package called Apache Struts as the technological crack that allowed hackers to heist Social Security numbers, birthdates, addresses and full legal names from a massive database maintained primarily for lenders.  SECURITY FOR DUMMIES  The disclosure , made late Wednesday, cast the company’s damaging security lapse in an even harsher light. The software problem was detected in March and a recommended software patch was released shortly afterward. Equifax said the database intrusion began in May and continued until July.  Security experts said Equifax had more than enough opportunity to block intruders by sealing the security hole. “There is no excuse for not following basic cybersecurity hygiene,” said Nate Fick, CEO of the security firm Endgame. “Some heads should definitely roll for this; it’s only a question of how many.”  The company didn’t respond to inquiries on Thursday.  Equifax was already under fire for not disclosing the break-in until Sept. 7 — nearly six weeks after the company discovered it— as well as for its handling of consumer inquiries about their exposure whether their personal information had been compromised and how they could protect their identities.  THE ENRON COMPARISON  On Thursday, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, called for the resignations of CEO Richard Smith and Equifax’s entire board of directors unless the company offers consumers more comprehensive identity-theft protection for the next decade. So far, Equifax is merely offering free credit monitoring for a year. It’s also temporarily waiving fees for people who freeze their credit records to prevent identity thieves from defrauding them.  “What has transpired over the past several months is one of the most egregious examples of corporate malfeasance since Enron,” Schumer said, invoking the name of a notorious company that manipulated energy markets and eventually went bankrupt.  Investors are clearly concerned about Equifax’s fate. The company’s stock has lost nearly a third of its value since it disclosed the breach. Three Equifax executives, including the company’s chief financial officer, preserved a significant chunk of their wealth by selling stock worth a combined $1.8 million just after management learned of the breach, but well before the public was notified.  Equifax said last week that the officials didn’t know about the breach at the time of those sales.  MORE INVESTIGATION  In another sign of the storm swirling around Equifax, the Federal Trade Commission took the unusual step of announcing it has opened a probe into the company’s practices.  The FTC is not the only Washington authority looking into the breach. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau previously announced its own investigation, and the House Financial Services Committee plans to hold hearings on the breach in early October when Smith is scheduled to testify. Politicians from both major parties are calling for additional investigations by Congress or the Department of Justice, raising the possibility of criminal charges.  A proposal to impose sweeping reforms on Equifax and its two main peers, TransUnion and Experian, also has been drawn up by Rep. Maxine Waters, D-California.  _____  Liedtke reported from San Francisco.",5.0,2,"[5.0, 5.0]"

(AP Photo/Kin Cheung)  HONG KONG (AP) — World stocks were mostly lower on Friday after North Korea launched another missile and as central banks continued to point to tighter monetary policy in coming months.  KEEPING SCORE: Britain’s FTSE 100 was the biggest loser, falling 1.2 percent to 7,208 after the pound surged on expectations of interest rate increases soon. Germany’s DAX lost 0.1 percent to 12,531 and France’s CAC 40 edged 0.1 percent lower as well, to 5,220. Wall Street was poised to open lower. Dow and S&P 500 futures both crept 0.1 percent lower.  MISSILE TENSIONS: North Korea launched an intermediate-range missile that flew 3,700 kilometers (2,300 miles), setting off alarms as it flew over Japan to land in the Pacific Ocean. The launch was the latest sign of Pyongyang’s willingness to defy international opinion as it moves closer to building up a military arsenal targeting U.S. forces. Asian markets fell in early trading but some regained their footing later, in a sign the initial shock for investors quickly wore off.  TRADER TALK: “Another day, another missile from North Korea,” said Rob Carnell, ING’s head of Asia research. “It would be wrong to say that markets are not taking any notice, but the relatively muted responses of the Japanese yen and Korean won, and risk assets globally, suggest that a sense of fatigue on this belligerence is creeping in.”  CENTRAL BANKS: The pound continued to surge, rising 1.3 percent to $1.3579, as Bank of England officials confirmed they expect to start raising interest rates for the first time in a decade in coming months. The central bank surprised Thursday with the message, which was reiterated by one of its officials Friday. The pound’s rise weighs on the FTSE 100 index because many of its listed companies are multinationals whose earnings abroad are decreased when translated back into pounds.  Meanwhile, investors are also digesting U.S. economic data as they await the Fed’s next move on rates. Data released Thursday showed U.S. consumer prices rose in August at their fastest pace in seven months. Industrial production and retail sales figures are due Friday, which could provide more hints on whether the Fed, which holds a scheduled two-day meeting wrapping up Wednesday, will remain on track to raise rates by the end of the year.

Trump has taken a hard stand that slashing the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to as low as 15 percent would free up cash at these companies. The money would seep into worker paychecks and hiring would accelerate. “We’re going to have magnificent growth,” Trump declared aboard Air Force One on Thursday. “We’re going to go like a rocket ship.” But several economists, tax experts and even some business owners say that’s unlikely. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)  WASHINGTON (AP) — For President Donald Trump, what’s good for General Motors is great for American workers. Same for Boeing. And AT&T. Not to mention small businesses.  Trump insists that slashing the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to as low as 15 percent would free up valuable cash. Companies would use the money to boost investment, increase employees’ pay, accelerate hiring and speed economic growth. What’s more, corporations that now keep trillions overseas to avoid U.S. taxes would bring the money home. American companies could better compete with rivals based in countries with lower tax rates.  “We’re going to have magnificent growth,” Trump declared aboard Air Force One on Thursday. “We’re going to go like a rocket ship.”  Would we? Many economists, tax experts and even some business owners say it’s unlikely. Rather than hire, companies might use much of their tax savings to buy back their stock or increase their dividends to investors. Many companies, they note, have already been able to borrow at historically low rates to expand their businesses yet have chosen not to.  “The mainstream economic evidence is that the bulk of corporate tax cuts go exactly to whom you would expect — which is wealthy investors and executives,” said Chye-Ching Huang, deputy director of federal tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.  Many economists foresee some benefits from overhauling and simplifying the corporate tax code, just not the extreme growth Trump is promising.  One reason corporate tax cuts might provide little overall benefit is the relative health of today’s economy. Unemployment is already unusually low at 4.4 percent. The economy is in the ninth year of a slow but steady expansion, rather than in a downturn in which tax cuts might deliver a major boost.  In a 2014 paper, two economists — Alexander Ljungqvist of New York University and Michael Smolyansky of the Federal Reserve — concluded that state corporate tax cuts did little to strengthen economic activity unless the cuts were made during a recession. (The flip side is that they found corporate tax increases to be “uniformly harmful.”)  Nor have previous efforts to reduce corporate taxes generally delivered as advertised. Kansas, for example, exempted hundreds of thousands of businesses from corporate taxes and cut individual rates in 2012, only to face a revenue squeeze as the intended economic growth never materialized.  The federal government provided a tax “holiday” on overseas profits in 2004 to bring money back into the United States at a discount to the 35 percent rate. But the Obama administration observed later that the move had diminished tax revenue and unintentionally led companies to hoard cash abroad in hopes of receiving that discount.  There is also concern that a corporate tax cut would swell the federal budget deficit. When the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center published an analysis this week, it found that even if virtually all tax breaks were eliminated, the corporate rate could drop only to 26 percent without increasing the deficit.  Still, many companies stress that lower business taxes would lead to more hiring. John Stephens, AT&T’s chief financial officer, said his company faces a typical tax rate of 34 percent — including federal, state, foreign and deferred taxes — in any given year.  Stephens estimates that lower rates would lead the company to immediately invest more money in its phone network, which he said would lead to more hiring by companies that work with AT&T.  “When we buy more equipment, our vendors hire more,” Stephens said. “When we build more extensive networks, we have people — hard-hat jobs — building those networks.”  The AT&T executive added that “anything” would be an improvement on the current corporate tax rate of 35 percent.  But like many corporations, AT&T also benefited substantially from tax breaks between 2008 and 2015, saving as much as than $38 billion, according to an analysis by the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. The administration has yet to spell out all the possible tax breaks that would be eliminated to pay for lower rates.  Even if the tax rates were slashed substantially, not all companies would see much of a reason to hire more workers. Bill Parks, who owns NRS, an Idaho-based boating gear company, says the tax cuts championed by Trump would no longer do much to help his business.  Years ago, the lower rates would have helped him because he was maxing out his personal credit cards and taking a second mortgage to fund NRS. But today’s borrowing rates are so low that investing in workers isn’t a burden, and tax changes would make little difference to his plans based on how his company is structured.  Gary Cohn, Trump’s top economic adviser, has argued that the planned tax cuts would help small businesses. By cutting taxes on profits that typically double as the owners’ personal income, those companies would then be able to hire more freely. This assumes that business owners want to expand their payroll rather than just enjoy higher profits.  Larry Summers, a Democratic former Treasury secretary, this month rattled off a list of reasons to reporters why lower corporate tax rates wouldn’t deliver as promised.  Though U.S. companies do face a high rate compared with other countries, Summers said, the fraction of profits being paid in federal taxes is low by historical standards. Corporate income taxes collected last year equaled just 1.6 percent of the economy, according to government records. That compares with 4 percent during the economic boom that followed World War II, an era of growth that Trump appears to want to revive.  Nor, in Summers’ view, would rising stock prices from a lower corporate tax rate shore up the pensions of firefighters, police officers and blue collar workers, as Cohn has argued.  Those few Americans who still have traditional “defined benefit” pensions don’t receive any additional income if the stock market rises, Summers said.  “The argument being made that the corporate tax cuts will somehow benefit workers is weak by the standards of ‘trickle-down’ arguments,” Summers said.  ___  AP writer Catherine Lucey in Washington contributed to this report.",3.0,2,"[2.5, 3.5]"

FILE - In this Monday, March 31, 2014, file photo, Tim McCormack, of Boston, inserts cash into a Liberty Teller ATM while purchasing bitcoins at South Station train station, in Boston. On Thursday, Sept. 14, 2017, Bitcoin tumbled 15 percent to about $3,300 against the dollar. (AP Photo/Steven Senne, File)  Bitcoin, hailed in some quarters as the future of currency, is having a rough week, with a flurry of rumors that China will shut down exchanges and the head of a major U.S bank calling bitcoin a “fraud.”  Plummeting prices have again raised questions about the wisdom of owning it, if not its legitimacy.  The digital, or cryptocurrency, tumbled 15 percent Thursday to about $3,300 against the dollar. Bitcoin, which has had bouts of volatility in the past, has shed about a third of its value since Sept. 1. But it’s still up about $600 compared with last year at this time.  Still getting up to speed on bitcoin? Here’s a quick rundown.  What is bitcoin?  Bitcoin is a digital currency created and exchanged without the involvement of banks or governments. Transactions allow anonymity, which has made it popular with people who want to keep their financial activity, and their identities, private. The digital coins are created by so-called “miners”, who operate computer farms that verify other users’ transactions by solving complex mathematical puzzles. These miners receive bitcoin in exchange. Bitcoin can be converted to cash when deposited into accounts at prices set in online trading.  Is this bitcoin’s swansong?  Not necessarily. Let’s take a look at recent data: In mid-July the value of bitcoin was around $1,900 per dollar, dropping from nearly $2,500 at the end of June. Users forced a change in the computer code, which was designed to improve capacity on the increasingly clogged network. The maneuver worked, helping to avoid a split in bitcoin and driving the value up to roughly $2,800 by the end of July.  Bitcoin’s value has fluctuated since then. At the beginning of August bitcoin’s value stood at about $2,710 and shot up to more than $4,700 by month’s end. But there’s been a steady decline this month, with the value slipping to approximately $3,300 on Thursday, according to Blockchain.info.  What happened this week?  One of China’s biggest bitcoin exchanges announced that it will cease trades following reports that Beijing will order all Chinese exchanges to close. And on Tuesday, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called bitcoin a fraud, saying that if any of his traders were dealing in the currency, he’d fire them.  Bitcoin tumbled 6 percent between Tuesday and Wednesday.  How are sovereign nations dealing with bitcoin?  In the U.S., the IRS has issued guidelines on the currency, calling it an “intangible asset” subject to taxation. But in the end, cash talks.  According to IRS guidance:  “Virtual currency that has an equivalent value in real currency, or that acts as a substitute for real currency, is referred to as ‘convertible’ virtual currency. Bitcoin is one example of a convertible virtual currency. Bitcoin can be digitally traded between users and can be purchased for, or exchanged into, U.S. dollars, Euros, and other real or virtual currencies.”  And it’s a hotly pursued asset by U.S. intelligence agencies, which see bitcoin as a funding vehicle in some instances for groups or individuals that intend to do harm.  China’s central bank has yet to respond to questions about bitcoin’s future, but it has warned in the past that the digital currency is being traded without regulatory oversight and might be linked to fraud. The bank banned initial offerings of new digital currencies last week.  Following the failure of a bitcoin exchange in Japan called Mt. Gox, that country has enacted new laws to regulate bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies. Mt. Gox shut down in February 2014, saying it lost about 850,000 bitcoins, possibly to hackers.  The Japanese government has also spelled out regulations to help prevent misuse of bitcoins and other virtual currencies for terrorism or other illegal activities, including requiring banks and other businesses to verify identities, keep records and report suspicious transactions. The regulations implemented in April require virtual currency traders to keep customers’ assets separate from their own, partly because of the losses suffered in the Mt. Gox bankruptcy.",3.25,2,"[4.0, 2.5]"

(AP Photo/Kathy Willens, File)  NEW YORK (AP) — Inmate No. 87850-053 has no internet.  That could be the least of the inconveniences ahead for “Pharma Bro” Martin Shkreli, whose online rantings about Hillary Clinton prompted a judge this week to revoke his bail and put him in the Metropolitan Detention Center, a fortress-like federal jail that also houses terrorism and mob suspects.  MDC, as the Brooklyn lockup for 1,800 men and women is known, has over the years drawn complaints ranging from sexual assaults to the lack of fresh air, sunlight and recreation.  Federal prison officials wouldn’t discuss Shkreli’s conditions, though his lawyer says his client is in with the general population. All defense attorney Ben Brafman would say of Shkreli’s two nights locked up so far is that he “is doing reasonably well under very difficult circumstances.”  Shkreli, a boyish pharma executive best known for jacking up the price of a life-saving drug, had been allowed to remain free on $5 million bail following his conviction last month in an unrelated securities fraud scheme involving two hedge funds he ran.  But Shkreli’s creepy Facebook posting offering a $5,000 bounty for a strand of Clinton’s hair was the last straw for U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto, who agreed with prosecutors that he should be put behind bars until his sentencing for securities fraud early next year.  He is facing up to 20 years in prison on the most serious charges. But he had brashly predicted in livestreamed rants that he would never see the inside of a prison because of sentencing guidelines — and that even if he did get prison time, it would be just a few months at a minimum-security “Club Fed.”  “I’ll play basketball and tennis and Xbox and be out on these streets in four months,” he boasted to the New York Daily News just minutes after his conviction.  That’s hardly what Shkreli will be experiencing at MDC, where he will remain for at least four months until his Jan. 16 sentencing.  The 34-year-old Shkreli is under the same roof as defendants accused of plotting to join the Islamic State group or commit attacks on its behalf. Others include organized crime family captain Vincent Asaro and Edgar Veytia, a former Mexican state attorney general charged with drug smuggling.  While far less notorious than city-run Rikers Island, the Brooklyn facility has a checkered history. After the Sept. 11 attacks, dozens of mostly Arab or Muslim men “of high interest” were detained at MDC, where many claimed guards regularly slammed them against walls until officials began videotaping them as a safeguard.  More recently, prosecutors have alleged that MDC was the scene of sexual assaults by guards on female inmates. A federal magistrate last year expressed reluctance to remand a woman there, citing a report saying there was an “absence of fresh, clean air, the complete absence of sunlight, and the absence of ANY outdoor time and activities.”  In a court filing, lawyers for Jacob “Kobi” Alexander, the convicted ex-CEO of Converse Technology, complained about a lack of recreation time, saying he “spends large parts of his day walking in circles in his unit when he is permitted to do so.”  When the technology website Gizmodo recently pressed Shkreli on a then-hypothetical question of what he would read if locked up, he played along.  “I don’t read much fiction,” he said, “but I would probably bone up on philosophy.”",2.875,4,"[3.5, 4.0, 0.5, 3.5]"

(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee)  Rising sea levels and fierce storms have failed to stop relentless population growth along U.S. coasts in recent years, a new Associated Press analysis shows. The latest punishing hurricanes scored bull’s-eyes on two of the country’s fastest growing regions: coastal Texas around Houston and resort areas of southwest Florida.  Nothing seems to curb America’s appetite for life near the sea, especially in the warmer climates of the South. Coastal development destroys natural barriers such as islands and wetlands, promotes erosion and flooding, and positions more buildings and people in the path of future destruction, according to researchers and policy advisers who study hurricanes.  “History gives us a lesson, but we don’t always learn from it,” said Graham Tobin, a disaster researcher at the University of South Florida in Tampa. That city took a glancing hit from Hurricane Irma — one of the most intense U.S. hurricanes in years — but suffered less flooding and damage than some other parts of the state.  In 2005, coastal communities took heed of more than 1,800 deaths and $108 billion in damages from Hurricane Katrina, one of the worst disasters in U.S. history. Images of New Orleans under water elicited solemn resolutions that such a thing should never happen again — until Superstorm Sandy inundated lower Manhattan in 2012. Last year, Hurricane Matthew spread more deaths, flooding and blackouts across Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. From 2010-2016, major hurricanes and tropical storms are blamed for more than 280 deaths and $100 billion in damages, according to data from the federal National Centers for Environmental Information.  Harvey, another historically big hurricane, flooded sections of Houston in recent weeks. Four counties around Houston, where growth has been buoyed by the oil business, took the full force of the storm. The population of those counties expanded by 12 percent from 2010 to 2016, to a total of 5.3 million people, the AP analysis shows.  During the same years, two of Florida’s fastest-growing coastline counties — retirement-friendly Lee and Manatee, both south of Tampa — welcomed 16 percent more people. That area took a second direct hit from Irma after it made first landfall in the Florida Keys, where damage was far more devastating.  Overall growth of 10 percent in Texas Gulf counties and 9 percent along Florida’s coasts during the same period was surpassed only by South Carolina. Its seaside population, led by the Myrtle Beach area of Horry County, ballooned by more than 13 percent.  Nationally, coastline counties grew an average of 5.6 percent since 2010, while inland counties gained just 4 percent. This recent trend tracks with decades of development along U.S. coasts. Between 1960 and 2008, the national coastline population rose by 84 percent, compared with 64 percent inland, according to the Census Bureau.  Cindy Gerstner, a retiree from the inland mountains of upstate New York, moved to a new home in January in Dunedin, Florida, west of Tampa. The ranch house sits on a flood plain three blocks from a sound off the Gulf of Mexico. She was told it hadn’t flooded in 20 years — and she wasn’t worried anyway.  “I never gave it a thought,” she said during a visit back to New York as Irma raked Florida. “I always wanted to live down there. I always thought people who lived in California on earthquake faults were foolish.”  Her enthusiasm for her new home was undiminished by Irma, which broke her fence and knocked out power but left her house dry.  In Horry County, where 19 percent growth has led all of South Carolina coastline counties, Irma caused only minor coastal flooding. The county’s low property taxes are made possible by rapid development and tourism fees, allowing retirees from the North and Midwest to live more cheaply. Ironically, punishing hurricanes farther south in recent years has pushed some Northerners known locally as “half-backers” to return halfway home from Florida and to resettle in coastal South Carolina.  Add the area’s moderate weather, appealing golf courses, and long white strands — the county is home to Myrtle Beach — and maybe no one can slow development there. “I don’t see how you do it,” said Johnny Vaught, vice chairman of the county council. “The only thing you can do is modulate it, so developments are well designed.”  Strong building codes with elevation and drainage requirements, careful emergency preparations, and a good network of roads for evacuation help make the area more resilient to big storms, said the council chairman, Mark Lazarus. Such measures give people “a sense of comfort,” said Laura Crowther, CEO of the local Coastal Carolina Association of Realtors.  Risk researchers say more is needed. “We’re getting better at emergency response,” said Tobin at the University of South Florida. “We’re not so good at long-term control of urban development in hazardous areas.”  The Federal Emergency Management Agency helps recovery efforts with community relief and flood insurance payments. The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It provides community grants for projects aimed at avoiding future losses. Some projects elevate properties, build flood barriers, or strengthen roofs and windows against high winds. Others purchase properties subject to repeated damage and allow owners to move.  But coastline communities face more storm threats in the future.  Global warming from human-generated greenhouse gases is melting polar ice and elevating sea levels at an increasing pace, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That amplifies storm surges and other flooding. Also, some climate models used by scientists predict stronger, more frequent hurricanes as another effect of global warming in coming decades.  “There will be some real challenges for coastal towns,” predicted Jamie Kruse, director of the Center for Natural Hazards Research at East Carolina University in Greenville, North Carolina. “We’ll see some of these homes that are part of their tax base becoming unlivable.”  Hazard researchers said they see nothing in the near term to reverse the trend toward bigger storm losses. As a stopgap, communities should cease building new high-rises on the oceanfront, said Robert Young, director of the Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines at Western Carolina University in Cullowhee, North Carolina.  He said big changes probably will not happen unless multiple giant storms overwhelm federal and state budgets.  “The reason why this development still continues is that people are making money doing it,” he said. “Communities are still increasing their tax base — and that’s what politicians like.”  ___  Donn reported from Plymouth, Massachusetts.  ___  Online:  National Centers for Environmental Information: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/  Center for Natural Hazards Research: http://www.ecu.edu/cs-cas/hazards/  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: http://www.noaa.gov/  Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines: https://psds.wcu.edu/  ___  HURRICANE NEWSLETTER - Get the best of the AP’s all-formats reporting on Irma and Harvey in your inbox: http://apne.ws/ahYQGtb",3.75,4,"[5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 2.5]"

Merkel is favored again to win the Sept. 24, 2017 parliament election. Merkel is favored to win a fourth term in Germany's Sept. 24, 2017 election. (AP Photo/Michael Sohn)  BERLIN (AP) — She’s been named the world’s most powerful woman, seen off a series of domestic rivals and led an unsentimental response to Europe’s debt crisis. But to many Germans, Chancellor Angela Merkel is a reassuring figure known simply as “Mutti” — Mom.  Beyond her bold decision to allow in large numbers of migrants and her insistence on budget cuts in Greece, Merkel’s more ordinary traits have helped make her an enduring presence and favorite to win a fourth term in Germany’s Sept. 24 election.  Merkel is not the most glamorous of political operators. But that’s part of her appeal.  People like a leader who grows her own vegetables, takes unglamorous walking holidays, is occasionally seen shopping at the supermarket and lives in the same Berlin apartment she did before becoming chancellor 12 years ago.  Merkel has broadly satisfied Germans with a combination of ideological flexibility, calm decision-making, personal modesty and a touch of wry humor.  “I had a phase in my childhood where I wanted to do everything I was really bad at — ballet dancer, balance beam gymnast,” Merkel said in June. “Over the years, I have made my peace with what I can and can’t do.”  Her pragmatic approach and willingness to adopt liberal competitors’ ideas — coupled with luck — have allowed the conservative leader to stamp her mark on Germany’s political center ground. Her knack for convincing Germans that she is on top of complicated crises and taking account of their worries earned her the “Mutti” nickname.  As chancellor, she dropped military conscription, introduced benefits encouraging fathers to look after their young children, and abruptly accelerated the shutdown of Germany’s nuclear power plants following Japan’s Fukushima disaster in 2011.  She allowed in large numbers of asylum-seekers in 2015, declaring that “we will manage it,” before gradually pivoting to a more restrictive approach. Most recently, she cleared the way for parliament to legalize same-sex marriage — without actually endorsing the change herself.  It’s an approach that has roots in Merkel’s improbable route to the top: the daughter of a Protestant pastor, who grew up in East Germany, she had an early career as a physicist and entered politics only in her mid-30s as communism crumbled.  “She has a fixed compass as far as her relationship with human rights is concerned, because of her experience of dictatorship and her Christian belief,” says Jacqueline Boysen, a Merkel biographer. “She is certainly a woman who is very principled, but she is unideological.”  As the leader of the Christian Democratic Union since 2000, Merkel has slowly but surely modernized the party, to make sure it keeps up with changes in society.  She has shifted positions quickly when needed: in 2005, after barely winning an election in which she was expected to prevail easily, she struck a coalition deal with her center-left rivals and dropped talk of far-reaching economic reforms at home.  Critics see opportunism and a lack of vision. Her first vice chancellor, center-left Social Democrat Franz Muentefering, later said that “if you imagine being with her in a plane that she is flying, you don’t have to be worried about crashing — but you don’t know where you will land.”  The chancellor’s methodical approach reflects her scientific background.  “My decisions sometimes take a very long time, but when they are made I very seldom have problems with these decisions,” Merkel said at a summer event hosted by a women’s magazine.  Over the years, Merkel says she has become more direct in saying what she wants. All the same, her public speaking is still notorious for idiosyncratic and circuitous formulations — another legacy, perhaps, of her upbringing behind the Iron Curtain.  She recalls “always having to read between the lines” in East Germany, where “very delicate hints were enough almost to put you on the side of the class enemy.”  “In a society where there is freedom of opinion, everyone is used to putting their interests on the table much more clearly,” she says. After German reunification, she “thought people would understand my delicate hints — but that didn’t always work.”  If the chancellor’s words aren’t always crystal clear, her body language can be telling. Merkel herself acknowledges that she doesn’t have a poker face.  “I’ve given up — I can’t do it,” she says. “You have to live with your weaknesses.”  That self-deprecating humor underlines a generally reserved and modest lifestyle.  “She is not someone who is interested in luxury — big cars, jewelry, handbags and shoes, it doesn’t interest her at all,” says Boysen, the biographer. “And that has the effect of inspiring confidence in German voters.”  Other than annual trips to the Bayreuth opera festival, Merkel and her second husband, publicity-shy chemistry professor Joachim Sauer, keep their private life private. They have no children.  Merkel offers the occasional fleeting glimpse of home life — she mashes potatoes to make potato soup, rather than pureeing them. Walking is a passion “because you can clear your head.”  On the world stage, Merkel has outlasted most leaders, bringing a reputation for endurance to all-night negotiating marathons. She’s not one for backslapping friendships, but has built durable relationships with difficult leaders such as Russian President Vladimir Putin. She has worked to engage President Donald Trump while also publicly keeping her distance.  A succession of domestic rivals has struggled to unseat her as Germany’s economy has powered ahead. Merkel has camped out in the center ground and held back from personal attacks — and, critics say, from formulating meaningful policies.  In June, center-left challenger Martin Schulz accused the conservative leadership of avoiding a debate on Germany’s future and seeking to push down turnout.  “I call it an attack on democracy,” he said.  The response? A smiling putdown.  “I’ve always had a different impression of Martin Schulz, and the election campaign is probably very arduous,” Merkel said a few days later. “Let’s forget it.”",2.0,4,"[2.5, 4.0, 1.0, 0.5]"

(AP Photo/Matt Dunham, Pool)  LONDON (AP) — British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has fueled speculation that he hopes to eventually succeed Prime Minister Theresa May by spelling out his Brexit goals days before her major policy speech on the topic.  Johnson, a former journalist, wrote a 4,000-word article in the Saturday edition of The Daily Telegraph newspaper to explain how Brexit can bring a “glorious” future to Britain and help it become “the greatest country on Earth.” He says Britain shouldn’t seek to stay in the European Union’s single market or the customs union, and should seize the opportunity to make its own way.  The timing of his Brexit broadside is important because May is scheduled to detail her own Brexit views at a much-touted speech in Italy on Sept. 22.  Johnson making his own views known first may be seen by many as a challenge to her authority, which has been weakened by a poor result in the June 8 election that cost her Conservative Party its majority in Parliament.  Johnson sought to quiet speculation later Saturday by tweeting: “All behind Theresa for a glorious Brexit.”  Johnson was an avid campaigner to have Britain leave the EU in the 2016 Brexit referendum.  He used the newspaper article to again raise the widely discredited idea that leaving the EU could allow Britain to add 350 million pounds ($475 million) a week to the National Health Service and argued that lifting regulations and reforming tax rules would allow Britain to prosper.  May has been able to hold onto her job despite her poor electoral performance, but has been facing increasing pressure as Brexit negotiations with the EU have stalled over the question of how much Britain must pay to leave the 28-nation bloc.  Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, whose opposition party fared well in the general election, said through a spokesman that Johnson’s Brexit views exposed the deep rifts within May’s Conservative government.  “Boris Johnson has laid bare the conflicts at the heart of Theresa May’s government over Brexit and cut the ground from beneath the prime minister’s authority,” Corbyn’s spokesman said. “In the process he has exposed the Tories’ real Brexit agenda — a race-to-the-bottom in regulation and corporate tax cuts to benefit the wealthy few at the expense of the rights of the rest of us.”",1.875,4,"[0.5, 3.0, 2.5, 1.5]"

Florida’s economy has long thrived on one major import: people. Irma raised concerns about just how sustainable the allure of Florida’s year-round warmth and lifestyle are. The wind, rain and flooding inflicted an estimated $50 billion in damage. (AP Photo/David Goldman)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Florida’s economy has long thrived on one import above all: People.  Until Irma struck this month, the state was adding nearly 1,000 residents a day — 333,471 in the past year, akin to absorbing a city the size of St. Louis or Pittsburgh. Every jobseeker, retiree or new birth, along with billions spent by tourists, helped fuel Florida’s propulsive growth and economic gains.  Yet Hurricane Irma’s destructive floodwaters renewed fears about how to manage the state’s population boom as the risks of climate change intensify. Rising sea levels and spreading flood plains have magnified the vulnerabilities for the legions of people who continue to move to Florida and the state economy they have sustained.  Florida faces an urgent need to adapt to the environmental changes, said Jesse Keenan, a lecturer at Harvard University who researches the effects of rising sea levels on cities.  “A lot is going to change in the next 30 years — this is just the beginning,” Keenan said.  People might need to live further inland, Keenan said, and employers might have to relocate to higher ground, with the resulting competition between offices and housing driving up land prices. It would become harder to adequately insure houses built along canals. Traffic delays could worsen across parts of Florida as more roads flood. Developers might shift away from sprawling suburban tracts toward denser urban pockets that are better equipped to manage floods.  At the same time, the belief remains firm among some developers and economists that for all the threats from rising water levels, the state’s population influx will continue with scarcely any interruption. The allure of lower taxes and easier living, the thinking goes, should keep drawing a flow of residents and vacationers.  “Irma doesn’t change the fact that there is no state income tax,” said Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida’s Institute for Economic Competitiveness. “In a few months, when the first Alberta Clipper starts blowing down cold weather across the United States and it’s 80 degrees and sunny down here, the memories of Irma will be blown away.”  Certainly, the influx of people has been testament to that appeal. After slowing when the housing bubble burst in 2007, the population has marched steadily upward. The number of Floridians, now above 20 million, is projected to hit 24 million by 2030, with more than half the increase coming from retiring baby boomers. Many of them first experienced Florida as tourists. More than 112 million people visited the state last year — a 33 percent increase over the past decade.  All of which means that compared with Hurricane Andrew 25 years ago, Irma struck a far more densely packed state. It is also one marked by greater extremes of wealth and poverty. Luxury condo towers populated by the global elite now crowd the Miami skyline. But the metro area is also cursed by the worst rental housing affordability in the United States, according to Harvard University’s Joint Center for Housing Studies.  Flooding washed away mobile home parks in the Florida Keys where lower-income workers live. As a magnet for jobs at restaurants, hotels and other parts of the services sector, the state attracts workers with relatively low incomes who can’t pay higher rents if flooding eliminates a chunk of the housing stock.  Still, Citigroup estimated that damages were just $50 billion — well below initial estimates — in part because some homes were better equipped to weather the wind and rain than during Andrew.  Storms can cause population loss in the near term. A year after Andrew hit in 1992, Miami-Dade County lost 31,000 residents. Many appear to have moved to Broward and Palm Beach counties, where the risks of flooding were lower, a pattern that could be repeated after Irma.  Given the brisk pace of construction and population growth, Florida could endure a heavy economic blow in coming decades if it fails to reduce the risks from climate change. Homes that were too close to eroding beaches could become effectively worthless. Those along canals that flood could become too costly to rebuild. The state’s economic fuel — tourism and residential development — could dissipate.  Sean Becketti, chief economist at Freddie Mac, the mortgage giant, warned in an analysis last year that rising sea levels and widening flood plains “appear likely to destroy billions of dollars in property and to displace millions of people.”  “The economic losses and social disruption,” Becketti added, “may happen gradually, but they are likely to be greater in total than those experienced in the housing crisis and Great Recession.”  Federal taxpayers might oppose bailing out these homeowners, Becketti said, mortgage lenders could absorb heavy losses and employers might choose to move to safer parts of the country — and take their jobs with them.  Still, for now at least, the heads of several major Florida real estate companies say they expect people to keep flocking to Florida despite the increasing risks.  Budge Huskey, president of Premier Sotheby’s International Realty, drove around Naples, Florida, and said he observed “very little damage” to homes constructed under new building codes after Hurricane Andrew. These houses had wind-resistant hurricane windows and stronger roofs.  “Let’s face it, people work their whole lives to retire to Florida — that’s where they want to be,” Huskey said.  Jay Parker, CEO of Douglas Elliman’s Florida brokerage, monitored Irma from an Atlanta hotel. He was gratified that Florida escaped much of the expected destruction. And he said would-be buyers, sniffing out potential bargains, were approaching him at the hotel about cut-rate deals on condos in the storm’s wake.  “If anything,” Parker said, “this might create some short-term buying sprees.”",4.0,4,"[4.0, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5]"

(AP) — Steve Ballmer says he started his new venture, USAFacts, as a way to “suck out all the data” collected by government agencies and shoot it back out to the public in a digestible form. The former Microsoft CEO, philanthropist and LA Clippers owner talked with The Associated Press about data —and the way people and machines collect it.  The interview has been edited for length and clarity.  Q: Microsoft is making a big push now on artificial intelligence. Do you think they’re doing enough?  A: We made a huge investment. People love to change the name over time. If you go back, we were doing speech recognition. Speech recognition’s a form of AI. We were doing computer vision. It’s a form of AI. We’ve been doing machine learning. It’s a form of AI.  Before all that, we were actually calling it AI and doing a bunch of AI. So I would say we’ve been working pretty coherently and consistently since the early ’90s.  The thing that has really changed in AI is the amount of data you can collect to inform the machine so it can get smarter in its learning. Search engines were really the first big, high-popularity AI systems. Now we have digital assistants like Cortana, Alexa, Siri. Self-driving cars are basically machine-learning AI engines. They learn to recognize where other cars are and what actions to take.  So there are a variety of things now that are popping. But it’s an investment Microsoft was making, certainly when I was there, and, by everything I read, as an external, third-party shareholder, the company continues to make good and important investments.  Q: What was your impetus for starting USAFacts?  A: I’m a numbers guy. I’m retired and my wife was talking with me about our philanthropic stuff and I highlighted that government has the most significant role. And that just got me interested in the broader issue of, where does our tax base come from? Where does it go to? Who’s it benefiting? That wound up being a separate interest from the rest of our philanthropy.  Q: There’s been concern that funding for the U.S. Census Bureau could be scaled back. How would that affect what you’re doing?  A: We use Census Bureau data. We don’t create any of our own data. We’re mostly repackaging. It’s fundamental for us that we continue to get the kind of data that the country gets, not only out of the every-10-year census, but there are a bunch of other surveys the Census Bureau runs that are very important.  Q: Is that something you plan to weigh in on?  A: I’m going to weigh in on the fact that we need the data. Sometimes you need better tools and better systems and sometimes you need more people, more budget. I don’t know about that because I don’t run the department. But I do know the outcome. The production of census data is super-important. I will certainly be an advocate for that.",3.0,5,"[3.0, 2.5, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5]"

KEEPING SCORE: Germany’s DAX rose 0.3 percent to 12,549 and France’s CAC 40 gained 0. 2 percent to 5,226. London’s FTSE 100 added 0.4 percent to 7,246. On Wall Street, the futures for the Dow Jones industrial average and for the Standard & Poor’s 500 were up 0.2 percent.  FED WATCH: Investors are looking ahead to this week’s Fed policy meeting for indications on the timing of the next rate hike and when the Fed might start shrinking its multitrillion-dollar stockpile of bonds. Forecasters expect the Fed to leave rates unchanged and stick to plans to raise rates in December. Investors also are looking for indications of when and how central bankers will start selling off bonds bought to shore up economic growth after the 2008 crisis.  NORTH KOREA: Markets are also watching Trump’s U.N. speech on Tuesday for any mention of military options on North Korea following its latest missile launch. The Security Council criticized Friday’s launch over Japan as “highly provocative.” Washington’s ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said Sunday that North Korea will be destroyed if it continues with reckless behavior.  ANALYST’S TAKE: “On the political front, no prizes for guessing that North Korea will top the agenda of President Trump’s address to the gathering of world leaders at the U.N.,” Rob Carnell of ING said in a report. “The political heat will also rise in Germany and New Zealand ahead of weekend elections. There could also be some more political action in Japan before long, as the media is suggesting that (Prime Minister Shinzo) Abe may call a snap election next month amid his rising approval rating and fragile opposition.”  CENTRAL BANK WATCH: In Europe, investors are monitoring a speech by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney for confirmation that the bank expects to raise interest rates in coming months for the first time in a decade. Central banks are also due to hold policy meetings in Japan, Taiwan, Philippines and Indonesia. The Reserve Bank of Australia is due to release minutes of its meeting earlier this month. All are expected to leave policy unchanged but forecasters expect Australian policymakers to strike a more hawkish tone following stronger recent economic activity.

Facebook has unwittingly allowed groups backed by the Russian government to target users with ads. That’s after it took months to acknowledge its outsized role in influencing the U.S. election by allowing for the spread of fake news. Now it is under siege, facing questions from lawmakers and others seeking to rein in its enormous power and demand more transparency. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)  NEW YORK (AP) — The problems keep piling up for Facebook, and it’s unclear how long the internet giant will be able to brush them aside as it barrels toward acquiring its next billion users.  The world’s biggest social network has unwittingly allowed groups backed by the Russian government to target users with ads. That’s after it took months to acknowledge its outsized role in influencing the U.S. election by allowing the spread of fake news — though before news emerged that it let advertisers target messages to “Jew-haters.”  Now Facebook is under siege, facing questions from lawmakers and others seeking to rein in its enormous power. The company has turned over information on the Russia-backed ads to federal authorities investigating Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election. Critics say the company also needs to tell its users how they might have been influenced by outside meddlers.  Speculation is rife that Facebook executives, perhaps including CEO Mark Zuckerberg, could be called to testify before Congress. Hearings might lead to new regulations on the company.  “Facebook appears to have been used as an accomplice in a foreign government’s effort to undermine democratic self-governance in the United States,” writes Trevor Potter, former chairman of the Federal Election Commission and now head of a nonpartisan election-law group, in a letter to Zuckerberg.  “ERA OF ACCOUNTABILITY”  Potter’s group, the Campaign Legal Center, wants Facebook to make the Russian-sponsored ads public. The company has so far declined to do so, citing the ongoing investigations. It has provided the ads and other information to Robert Mueller, the special counsel in charge of the Russia investigation, Facebook said in a statement, although it declined to elaborate.  The company that nudges its users to reveal intimate details about their lives, it turns out, isn’t all that comfortable doing the same. That’s true for everything from the secret algorithms that recommend “people you might know” to data on its attempts to clamp down on the spread of false news shared across its network.  The company justifies its secrecy in many ways, having variously claimed legal restrictions, business secrets, security and privacy protections to excuse its opacity. But Jonathan Albright, whose late 2016 research on the “fake news” propaganda ecosystem outlined how propaganda websites track and target users, thinks the current moment may be a turning point for online giants like Facebook.  “Now that it has run directly into something that possibly affected the outcome of the election — but they can’t determine how — this may be their era of accountability,” said Albright, the director of research at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.  There has been no other company on the planet, Albright added, that can provide access to as many real people as Facebook.  POWER GAMES AND NEW RULES  Facebook prefers to think of itself as an online platform, but in many respects it’s also a modern sort of media company, if for no other reason than that so many people rely on it as a source of news and information. In its early years, Facebook even described itself as a “social utility.”  Now the question is whether it should be regulated as one — and if so, how. There aren’t many straightforward answers, even where political ads already subject to government rules are concerned.  It’s already illegal for foreign nationals to spend money in connection with a U.S. federal election, whether on or off of Facebook. And campaign law requires people who spend money on another person’s website to disclose that fact in the ad itself.  Broadcast-era election law, however, can be a poor fit for the Internet Age. Attempts to sway political sentiment on Facebook can be targeted to small groups who share a common background or attitudes, making them difficult to track from the outside. And many such efforts might not resemble traditional advertisements at all. The goal of many Facebook marketing campaigns is to generate posts that regular people will spread widely for free; political persuasion campaigns can work the same way.  “As a practical matter, it is extremely difficult for the U.S. government to regulate content on the internet that may have an effect on the U.S. election,” said Nathaniel Persily, a professor at Stanford Law School. “If a teenager in his mother’s basement in Moscow wants to put up a YouTube video, it’s not clear what the U.S. will be able to do about that.”  Difficult doesn’t mean impossible. Persily, for instance, thinks that Facebook could use its AI technology to flag election-related ads that don’t bear the disclosures required by existing law.  Companies like Facebook could also be required to do some kind of due diligence on who is spending money on their platforms on behalf of candidates, he added. Keeping an online repository of all candidate-related ads within six months of an election, identified by their backers, could also provide an additional check on illegal attempts to sway elections.",3.5,4,"[0.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0]"

When a former police officer was acquitted in the fatal shooting of a black suspect, protesters vowed to show their disdain by disrupting business in downtown St. Louis. (AP Photo/Jeff Roberson, File)  ST. LOUIS (AP) — When a former police officer was acquitted in the fatal shooting of a black suspect, protesters vowed to show their disdain by disrupting business in downtown St. Louis. They quickly succeeded.  The unrest that followed Friday’s ruling closed large corporate offices, shut down restaurants and bars and even forced U2 to call off a concert that would have drawn 50,000 fans into the heart of the city. And protest organizers may not be done.  The demonstrations engulfed the St. Louis region after a judge acquitted Jason Stockley of first-degree murder in the 2011 death of 24-year-old Anthony Lamar Smith. Within hours, downtown came to a standstill as marching protesters blocked traffic. The demonstrations went on through the weekend, with protest crowds swelling to thousands of people and spilling into a posh area of restaurants and bars in western St. Louis, the hip Delmar Loop area of nearby University City and even into two shopping malls.  More than 140 people were arrested.  The protests forced U2 to cancel a concert at the Edward Jones Dome, St. Louis’ largest venue. Police said they could not provide normal protection because of the unrest, the band and concert promoter Live Nation said in a statement.  Singer Ed Sheeran also called off a show. The St. Louis Symphony and a Shakespearean Theatre group canceled performances, too.  Democratic state Rep. Bruce Franks, a protest organizer, said making the entire community uncomfortable is an important part of the demonstrations. Franks said protests would continue, but he did not say when or where.  “Folks got to pay attention, right?” Franks said Monday. “Do we just say, ‘Oh, it’s another case where an officer’s found not guilty and leave it at that’? No, we get out here and disrupt and make our presence felt.”  Joe Reagan, president and CEO of the St. Louis Regional Chamber of Commerce, said it’s too early to put a dollar amount on the economic cost.  “But in the long term, there are greater economic impacts from the racial disparity and the mistrust many have in the criminal justice system,” Reagan said. “This is not new to St. Louis or unique to St. Louis, but this is a challenge.”  Many business owners are dealing with more than lost time or canceled events. Police said nearly two dozen businesses were damaged Saturday night in University City, mostly by having their windows broken. On Sunday, more windows were broken in downtown St. Louis, and several large decorative pots with plants were smashed.  Chris Rubin de la Borbolla, owner of a clothing, jewelry and accessories store in University City, said his broken window will probably cost him at least $2,000. Damage to merchandise will cost him about $2,000 more.  Joe Edwards, owner of the Blueberry Hill restaurant and concert venue and many other Delmar Loop businesses, said he was particularly frustrated because much of the damage occurred at businesses owned by minorities.  “Forty-five years ago, this street was in great decline and by embracing diversity we overcame it,” said Edwards, who is white. “Whoever threw rocks doesn’t care. They just want anarchy.”  But Edwards said it was heartwarming Sunday when artists from around the region turned out to transform the plywood covering broken windows into art. Restaurants and shops were busy with people who “came in to shop and show support,” he said.  Protests resumed for the fourth straight day just after dawn Monday. A racially mixed crowd of roughly 150 people marched silently to City Hall for a rally, then to a city court building for another. Police did not intervene.  On Monday night, demonstrators gathered outside the jail in downtown St. Louis for more than two hours to show solidarity with those who remained behind bars after being arrested on Sunday.  It was a far cry from the scene hours earlier, when a small crowd left over from an earlier peaceful protest marched into downtown late Sunday. Once they started breaking windows and throwing things at officers, police reinforcements quickly emerged and protesters scattered.  For the next several hours, hundreds of officers in riot gear lined downtown streets. More than 80 people were arrested, including onlookers who refused orders to disperse. Among those arrested was reporter Mike Faulk of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, according to the newspaper.  The cause for the escalation was not clear. Protesters blamed police for showing up in riot gear. Police said demonstrators began throwing things at them.  One officer suffered a leg injury and was taken to a hospital. His condition wasn’t known.  “I’m proud to tell you the city of St. Louis is safe and the police owned tonight,” interim Police Chief Lawrence O’Toole said in an early morning video posted on Twitter.  The Sunday night unrest followed a pattern familiar since the protests in nearby Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, following the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown. Raucous but peaceful protests dominate during the daytime and early evening, giving way to much small but more confrontational demonstrations at night.  “The days have been calm and the nights have been destructive,” Mayor Lyda Krewson said as she stood with O’Toole on the Twitter video.  ___  Associated Press writer Summer Ballentine contributed to this report.",3.8333333333333335,3,"[3.0, 3.5, 5.0]"

(AP Photo/Shizuo Kambayashi)  LONDON (AP) — Global stock markets traded in fairly narrow ranges Tuesday as investors paused for breath, a day after U.S. stock markets struck a record high and geared up for the latest interest rate decision from the U.S. Federal Reserve.  KEEPING SCORE: In Europe, France’s CAC 40 was up 0.1 percent at 5,234 while Germany’s DAX was 0.1 percent lower at 5,234. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares rose 0.4 percent to 7,278. U.S. stocks were poised for a steady opening with Dow futures and the broader S&P 500 futures up 0.1 percent. On Monday, the two benchmark U.S. indexes extended gains, albeit modestly, to close at record highs.  THE FED: The consensus in markets is that the Fed will hold off from raising interest rates again but indicate that another increase could come in December. But traders will be listening for any indications the central bank could move sooner.  ANALYST TAKE: “While we’re not expecting any surprises out of the meeting, in terms of another rate hike for example, we should learn a lot about how the Fed plans to tighten monetary policy going forward and that will determine how U.S. yields and the dollar respond,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA.

KEEPING SCORE: In Europe, Germany’s DAX was down 0.1 percent at 12,552 while the CAC 40 in France was steady at 5,240. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was stable at 7,272. Wall Street was poised for a similarly flat opening with Dow futures and the broader S&P 500 futures unchanged.  FED WATCH: At the end of its two-day meeting on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce it will begin to reduce its enormous bond portfolio, which reached $4.5 trillion. The move will gradually increase long-term borrowing rates. While the decision to shrink the Fed’s balance sheet is much expected, when and how the Fed will manipulate its target for short-term interest rates is less clear. After leaving its benchmark rate at a record low for seven years after the 2008 crisis, the Fed has modestly raised the rate four times since December 2015 to a still-low range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent.  ANALYST TAKE: “Details on balance sheet reduction will be of interest, but crucially the committee will extend its rate outlook in 2020, and this could give us a good sense of the end-point for the interest rate in this current tightening cycle,” said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG.  WORLD ECONOMY: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development maintained its global growth forecast for this year at 3.5 percent and next year’s but lifted next year’s to 3.7 percent. It also now thinks that the eurozone will grow by 2.1 percent this year, 0.3 percentage point more than its previous prediction in June. That means the OECD is expecting eurozone growth this year to match the U.S. rate, which it left unchanged. And next year, it’s forecasting growth of 1.9 percent for the eurozone, 0.1 percentage point more than previously thought, but below its 2.4 percent projection for the U.S. The big three eurozone economies — Germany, France and Italy — all saw upward revisions.

189,1131,9,19,2017,2017-09-19,Associated Press News,The big question: Will cancer immune therapy work for me?,"In this Aug. 15, 2017 photo, Dr. Razelle Kurzrock poses for a portrait in her office in San Diego. Immunotherapy is the hottest thing in cancer treatment, but it's not for everyone. It can put some very advanced, thought-to-be-terminal cancers into remission, but for some unlucky folks, it can make their cancer much worse. Gene tests now are helping reveal who is most likely to benefit. ""These are the patients we used to be very depressed about,"" thinking they couldn't be helped, said Kurzrock. ""Now when we see those types of patients, we're really excited,” because there are so many ways for the immune system to recognize the cancer cells as abnormal. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull)  SAN DIEGO (AP) — Dennis Lyon was a genetic train wreck. Cancer was ravaging his liver, lungs, bones and brain, and tests showed so many tumor mutations that drugs targeting one or two wouldn’t do much good. It seemed like very bad news, yet his doctors were encouraged.  The reason: People with the most messed-up genes often are the ones who do best on treatments that enlist the immune system.  “These are the patients we used to be very depressed about,” thinking they couldn’t be helped, said Dr. Razelle Kurzrock at the University of California, San Diego. “Now when we see those types of patients, we’re really excited,” because there are so many ways for the immune system to recognize the cancer cells as abnormal.  Immunotherapy is the hottest thing in cancer care. Drugs called checkpoint inhibitors can vanquish some advanced cancers by removing a chemical cloak that hides them from the immune system. Former President Jimmy Carter got one at age 91 for skin cancer that spread to his brain, and now is in remission.  But they’re expensive, have side effects, and work for only about one-quarter of patients — as few as 5 percent with colon cancer and as many as half with the skin cancer, melanoma. Sometimes the benefits are brief.  AP Video/Cindy Sharp  Worst of all: For a small number of unlucky folks, treatment can backfire. Their cancer grows exponentially after getting a checkpoint drug.  “We’re going to have to figure out not only who to treat with immunotherapy but who not to treat,” Kurzrock said.  Gene tests are starting to help sort that out. But for patients, the big question is “Will it work for me?”  PREDICTING WHO BENEFITS  The first step is testing for a protein called PD-L1 that’s often involved in forming that chemical cloak. Some checkpoint drugs target this or a related protein, so people with a lot of it should respond to treatment.  That was the hope when Diane Tippett showed up last October at Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center with a salivary gland cancer that had spread to her liver and lungs.  “Five years ago, I probably would have thrown up my hands and given her standard chemo,” said the center’s director, Dr. Louis Weiner.  Instead, he ordered tests that showed Tippett had a PD-L1 mutation, meaning her cancer made a lot of it. He started the 49-year-old Leonardtown, Maryland, woman on a checkpoint drug, Opdivo, and told her to come back in a few months.  “Quite honestly, I didn’t know if I’d ever see her again,” he said.  Now, Tippett’s lung tumors are gone. Her liver tumor shrank 50 percent and is stable. She got married in July and says she feels great.  “I don’t feel any different than you do. I’m not tired, I’ve got all my hair,” she said. “I want more people to know about it and to ask their doctors about it,” she said of immunotherapy and the testing that led her to it.  (AP Animation/Marshall Ritzel)  NOT THE WHOLE STORY  That protein isn’t a very reliable predictor, though. Some people with a lot of it don’t benefit from the drugs and the opposite also is true. There are other checkpoints besides that one, too.  Researchers increasingly are focusing on something else Tippett had: a high number of flawed genes. It’s a sign that tumors have been evolving over time and are hard to treat with drugs that target a single gene. It sometimes accompanies two other DNA problems that some checkpoint drugs already are approved to treat.  Lyon, the San Diego man, had nearly two dozen different mutations after his skin cancer spread widely. In October 2015, he started on Opdivo and was in near-complete remission within two months. Recent tests showed no active cancer in his spine and lungs, and doctors think small spots in his brain and liver may be scar tissue, though they can’t know for sure. A test for tumor DNA in his blood found none.  “It would appear my cancer is all dead,” he said, and called it “nothing short of miraculous” that gene tests led to successful treatment after years of trial and error. “I’m so grateful. No one’s lucky that gets cancer but I may be in an era where there’s a way through this tunnel.”  Three-quarters of patients who are helped by checkpoint drugs have long-lasting benefits, as Lyon did, said Dr. Steven O’Day, an immunotherapy expert at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, California.  “When you respond, it’s a home run in terms of long-term survival,” O’Day said. “But we still have to be better at predicting who those patients are.”  THE DARK SIDE  Others have not been so fortunate. In November, French researchers reported that 12 of 131 patients, or 9 percent, got much worse after checkpoint drugs, which seemed to speed their tumor growth.  Kurzrock checked with colleagues and quickly found more cases — a 73-year-old man with bladder cancer, a 65-year-old woman with endometrial cancer, and a 44-year-old breast cancer patient whose tumors “just exploded” in size within two months of immunotherapy.  In a report on 155 patients, she tied several gene mutations to this risk. Kurzrock has consulted for some gene-medicine makers and co-founded a company using a software program to determine best treatments for patients depending on their tumor genes.  The unfortunate cases are a reality check, said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society.  “We are not paying close enough attention to those people” and need to know whether they fared badly because of their treatment or for other reasons, he said.  SHOULD WE BE DOING ‘IMMUNOGRAMS’?  That’s the question Dr. Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Translational Science Institute, posed a gene medicine conference he organized in March at the suburban San Diego research center. Should there be baseline tests to map what patients’ natural defenses look like? For example, how many immune system soldiers called T cells do they have in the area of the tumor?  Max Krummel is working on a roadmap to do that. The University of California, San Francisco, scientist heads a project with $10 million from three companies that make checkpoint drugs. He is analyzing hundreds of tumor samples to see what immune system features spell success or failure.  “We’re not looking at how the immune system changes,” but for what starting point works best with the drugs, he said. “What we’re seeing is that the kinds of cells you have in a tumor predict who’s going to respond.”  Krummel, who was involved in work that led to Yervoy, the first checkpoint drug, has started a company to try to tune up one part of the immune system he thinks is key to maintaining a healthy balance.  Cancer exists because the immune system isn’t working as it should, he said, so successful immunotherapy may require “treating the immune system, not treating the tumor.”  ___  Marilynn Marchione can be followed on Twitter: @MMarchioneAP  ___  This Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan)  WARSAW, Poland (AP) — The difference between Apple’s new iPhone models is a bit like flying first class compared with coach. We envy first class, but coach gets us there without breaking the budget.  The iPhone 8 will do just fine for $300 less than the glitzy iPhone X , even though it won’t make your friends and colleagues jealous. It’s also available much sooner — this Friday — starting at almost $700. The X (read as the numeral 10) won’t be out until November.  Still, the iPhone 8 remains a fairly straightforward update of the iPhone 7 , which itself was a fairly straightforward update of the iPhone 6S. Then again, no one expects much different from a coach seat.  WHAT YOU’RE NOT GETTING  It’s hard to talk about the iPhone 8 without comparing it to my 15 minutes with the iPhone X last Tuesday.  The X wowed with a fancy new display that flows to the edges of the phone. The phone is compact, yet features a screen slightly larger than the one on the supersized iPhone 8 Plus. The X also features facial recognition that lets you unlock the phone with a glance; you can also create animated emojis that match your facial expressions.  AP Deputy Technology Editor Nick Jesdanun describes the pros and cons of the new iPhone 8 that goes on sale this week. (Sept. 19)  The 8 has none of that, although it does share other new goodies the X is getting, including wireless charging. The 8 and the X both have faster processors and sensors to enhance graphics in augmented reality, a blending of the virtual and physical worlds, though older iPhones will also run AR apps with a software update Tuesday.  WIRELESS CHARGING  Apple is embracing wireless-charging technology that Android phones have had for years. It’s a rare case in which Apple isn’t going its own way; instead, it’s adopting an existing standard called Qi (pronounced chee). That means the iPhone gets all the technical advancements from the consortium behind Qi — and can take immediate advantage of a slew of public wireless-charging stations.  It worked perfectly for me while waiting for a connecting flight in Los Angeles — no need to rummage through my backpack for a charging cord.  Apple says the wireless system should charge as quickly as the wall adapter included with iPhones. But I found wireless slower in testing, using a Belkin charger with the same power output as the iPhone charger.  Wireless charging is largely about convenience; it’s terrific if you can just drop your phone on a charging pad overnight or during the day at your desk. Apple says it will boost wireless-charging power by 50 percent in coming months, which will speed things up further. But those in a rush should consider a wall charger that comes with the iPad, which will still be even faster.  In a way, wireless charging makes up for Apple’s earlier decision to ditch the headphone jack in the iPhone 7, which made people share the Lightning port with both charging cords and wired headphones. You can now charge and use wired headphones at the same time.  DISPLAY  Colors on the 8′s screen adapt to lighting in the room. It’s noticeable in my apartment at night, as artificial lighting tends to be warmer and more yellowish. The screen adapts by making whites more like beige and yellow even yellower. It’s softer on the eyes and mimics how light glows on white paper, though it can make images appear less natural. You can turn this feature off.  Resolution isn’t as sharp as what the X and many rival Android phones offer. The Plus offers enough pixels for high-definition video at the highest quality, 1080p, while the regular model is comparable to the lesser 720p.  CAMERA  New color filters produce truer and richer colors without looking fake, while a new flash technique tries to light the foreground and background more evenly. You have to know to look, as the iPhone 7 already had a great camera. Differences in test shots taken while sightseeing in Poland were subtle, but noticeable — more so on the iPhone 8 screen than on last year’s Mac.  The iPhone 8 also offers additional video options, including recording of ultra-high definition, or 4K, at 60 frames per second, twice the previous rate. (The phone’s display, though, isn’t sharp enough for 4K.)  A second lens in the 7 Plus and 8 Plus models lets the camera gauge depth and blur backgrounds in portrait shots, something once limited to full-featured SLR cameras. Samsung adopted that feature in this year’s Note 8 .  Coming to the 8 Plus are filters to mimic studio and other lighting conditions. My favorite, stage light, highlights the subject’s face and darkens the background. Some of these filters make images look fake — Apple has slapped a “beta” test tag to signal it’s not flawless. You can try them out and undo any changes you don’t like.  DESIGN  To make wireless charging work, the 8 features a glass back, something last seen in the iPhone 4S in 2011. Aesthetic considerations aside, this gives you another sheet of glass to break.  Apple says custom glass from Corning makes the phone stronger. Even so, consider a service plan and get a case. Wireless charging works with most cases, as long as there’s no metal or magnets. I found the phone charged just as fast with the case on.  ABOUT THAT PRICE TAG  The iPhone 8 is about $50 more than what the iPhone 7 cost at launch. Samsung has similarly increased the prices of its flagship Galaxy phones, and the S8 still outsold last year’s S7. Consumers seem willing to pay.  You do get double the storage — 64 gigabytes — at that price, a value considering that iPhone storage boosts typically cost $100. You’ll need that extra storage for video, apps and fancy features such as AR and animated photos.  Nonetheless, I would have preferred the option of a cheaper, lower-storage version. For that, you need an older model , such as the $549 iPhone 7 and the $449 6S. There’s also the smaller iPhone SE for $349.",2.8,5,"[3.0, 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 0.5]"

Asian shares were mostly lower and the dollar strengthened Thursday after the Fed said it would start trimming its bond holdings and planned one more interest rate increase this year. (AP Photo/Vincent Yu)  LONDON (AP) — Global stock markets were mixed Thursday as investors digested the latest statements from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which indicated that it remains on course to raise interest rates on several occasions over the coming year.  KEEPING SCORE: In Europe, the FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was unchanged at 7,273 while Germany’s DAX was 0.3 percent higher at 12,612. The CAC 40 in France was 0.5 percent firmer at 5,270. U.S. stocks were poised for a steady opening with Dow futures and the broader S&P 500 futures unchanged.  FED IN FOCUS: At their latest meeting, Fed policymakers kept short-term interest rates unchanged but said they still expect one more increase this year and three in 2018, if persistently low inflation rebounds. Since December 2015, the Fed has modestly raised the rate four times. Rates had previously been cut to a record low after the 2008 financial crisis, helping to fuel a multiyear global stock boom. Officials also said they plan to start unwinding the U.S. central bank’s $4.5 trillion balance sheet next month by reducing its bond holdings, which will gradually increase long-term borrowing rates. The plans were mostly in line with economist expectations.  INVESTOR INSIGHT: “Even now, despite the Fed effectively forecasting four rate hikes before the end of next year, markets are pricing in only one or two and even then, unconvincingly,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA. “Clearly there is still a lot of convincing to do on the Fed’s part, potentially providing in the process plenty of upside for U.S. yields and the dollar.”  DOLLAR SPIKE: The dollar did enjoy a spike on the back of the statement. On Thursday, the euro was flat at $1.1893 having traded above $1.20 on Wednesday, while the dollar was up 0.3 percent at 112.53 yen.  JAPAN ON HOLD: Officials at Japan’s central bank, meanwhile, made no changes to monetary policy, leaving in place stimulus measures to prop up Asia’s No. 2 economy. The decision, which was widely expected, was approved in an 8-1 vote, with one new board member unexpectedly dissenting, saying the measures weren’t aggressive enough.  ASIA’S DAY: Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 added 0.2 percent to close at 20,347.48 as the yen weakened against the dollar, benefiting shares of exporters. But other regional indexes wavered, with South Korea’s Kospi slipping 0.2 percent to 2,406.50. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index slipped 0.1 percent to 28,110.33 and the Shanghai Composite in mainland China lost 0.2 percent to 3,357.81. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 fell 0.9 percent to 5,660.40.  ENERGY: Oil futures snapped their rally. Benchmark U.S. crude shed 51 cents to trade at $50.18 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, while Brent crude, used to price international oils, dropped 43 cents to $56.86 a barrel in London.",3.375,4,"[3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 2.5]"
195,1170,9,20,2017,2017-09-20,Associated Press News,AP Interview: Japan’s emoji creator saw nuance in pictures,"In this Sept. 14, 2017, photo, Django Co., Ltd. Director Shigetaka Kurita writes a pictograph during an interview at his office in Tokyo. The Japanese creator of the first emoji wanted to add nuance to mobile phone messages and never imagined his 1999 work would become a global phenomenon. (AP Photo/Shizuo Kambayashi)  TOKYO (AP) — The tiny smiley faces, hearts, knife-and-fork or clenched fist have become a global language for mobile phone messages. They are displayed in the Museum of Modern Art in New York. They star in a new Hollywood film.  The emoji is heir to a tradition of pictographic writing stretching back millennia to Egyptian hieroglyphics and the ideograms used to write Chinese and Japanese.  Despite their ubiquity, they started in 1998 with one man: A 25-year-old employee of mobile phone carrier NTT DoCoMo who created the first set of 176 in one month as he rushed to meet a deadline.  “I happened to arrive at the idea. If I hadn’t done it, someone else would have,” said Shigetaka Kurita, who now is a board member at Dwango Co., a Tokyo technology company.  Meet man behind emoji – those tiny smiley faces, other images that have become global language for mobile messages. https://t.co/0bS5okN5ek pic.twitter.com/f2J3MX7OrX — The Associated Press (@AP) September 21, 2017  Kurita’s challenge: NTT DoCoMo’s “i-mode” mobile internet service limited messages to 250 characters, which cried out for some kind of shorthand.  A message that said, “What are you doing now?” could be menacing or nosey, but adding a smiley face softened the tone.  “Digital messaging was just getting started, and so I was thinking about what was needed,” said Kurita.  Following i-mode’s launch in 1999, that nuance made emoji an immediate hit in Japan, where the demands of courtesy make for a complex art and a tiny mistake can prove costly. Emoji combines the Japanese for “picture,” or “e″ (pronounced “eh”), and “letters,” or “moji” (moh-jee).  Kurita collected common images including public signs, weather symbols, the zodiac and comic book-style pictures such as a light bulb or a ticking bomb.  With simple lines, he made five faces — happy, angry, sad, surprised and perplexed. The heart and a smiley face are still his favorites.  Some visuals transcend culture. A drop of sweat rolling down a cheek means exasperation or anxiety. Others confuse: A camcorder was misread by many as a fish.  “Japanese tend to excel at making the most of limitations. It’s a nation filled with limitations, a small piece of land,” said Kurita. “We do well at carrying out tasks within a framework, rather than being given a free hand.”  Western players Apple and Google made emoji a global phenomenon.  “Perhaps because of the popularity of the iPhone, Apple’s art style for its emojis also became extremely influential, to the point that when most people think of emoji imagery, they’re thinking of Apple’s take on it,” said Jason Snell, a tech journalist and podcaster.  Kurita shrugs that off. The dozen-member team designing i-mode was making something for Japan long before smartphones.  “Japanese always are too ahead of our time,” said Kurita, an unpretentious man with a quick smile.  “I think Galapagos is OK. It’s cool,” he said, referring to the remote Pacific Island, used in Japan to describe the nation’s insularity. “After all, how can Japan hope to win as a global standard?”  “And so we go ahead with our Galapagos ways in Japan, and people abroad will see it as wonderfully Japanese.”  Kurita’s invention inspired “The Emoji Movie,” an animated film by Sony Pictures about emojis that live inside the world of a smartphone. It has yet to be shown in Japan but was modestly popular in the United States.  In 2010, the 12-by-12-pixel designs were adopted as a global standard by the Unicode Consortiums. That means any phone or operating system that follows the standard will use the same images, making them a universal language.  Some initially opposed making emoji a Unicode standard, according to Yasuo Kida, a technology expert who was involved in their adoption.  Among the arguments: emoji was mere pictures, too infantile and uniquely Japanese. But Kida said companies that saw Japan as an important market won out.  What began as primitive digital drawings is growing into an elaborate tool for communication with more choices for pictures and animation, such as Apple’s latest Animoji, Kida said.  Unlike Kurita, Kida finds it sad Japanese lose out on opportunities to reap benefits of their innovations on a global scale due to lack of language skills and international influence.′  Yuka Kubo, a researcher at the University of Tokyo, is working on a book about how young Japanese women pioneer innovations such as selfies and use of emojis as art that are ridiculed but become hits.  “The young women are expressing their rebellion against the adult world, but in a playful way,” said Kubo.  These days, Kurita works on a popular live video streaming service called Niconico. He believes such services will become more interactive, building online communities, possibly with artificial intelligence.  Kurita doesn’t feel all that involved with emoji today because they have evolved beyond his original set. He receives no royalties and is little-known in Japan outside technology circles.  He paid his own air fare to New York last year to see the Museum of Modern Art exhibit, which cited him by name.  Kurita was overcome with emotion.  “There they were, something I’d been involved with, although I’m neither an artist nor a designer,” he said. “The museum saw value in the design that had the power to change people’s lifestyles.”  ___  Kageyama can be reached at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama  Her work can be found at https://www.apnews.com/search/yuri%20kageyama",2.375,4,"[5.0, 2.5, 0.5, 1.5]"

The Japanese video game industry is finding its way out of the doldrums, by adapting new technology for decades-old titles. And that energy was evident at the annual game show. (AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko)  CHIBA, Japan (AP) — The Japanese video game industry is finding its way out of the doldrums by adapting new technology for decades-old titles. And that energy was evident at the annual Tokyo Game Show, which opened to media Thursday before opening to the public over the weekend.  “Our old fans used to play Japanese games, and those people are excited those games are coming back and they recognize them as Japanese-style games,” game creator Koji Igarashi told The Associated Press at the show in Makuhari Messe hall in Chiba, a Tokyo suburb.  “Truly game-like games” is the way Igarashi described the genres enjoying revival, including his side-scrolling role-playing games. His latest version will come with a 3-D movie section.  Although smartphones hammered the video-games market for some years, from about 2010, the companies have adjusted. After the dust settled, some of the games that stood the test of time turned out to be Japanese, such as “Monster Hunter” and “Resident Evil,” known as “Biohazard” in Japan, both from Capcom Co., the “Super Mario” series from Nintendo and “Gran Turismo” from Sony, to name a few.  Also helping are new consoles from the Japanese makers, such as the PlayStation 4 from Sony Corp. and the Nintendo Switch. More than 60 million PlayStation 4, or PS4, consoles have been sold since they went on sale last year. Switch sales already total some 4.7 million globally. Switch went on sale in March.  Kyoto-based Nintendo Co. initially scoffed at the threat from smartphones but did an about-face and began offering smartphone versions of their flagship games like “Super Mario” since 2015. “Pokemon Go,” featuring Nintendo’s Pokemon characters and played on smartphones, became a global hit.  Games are also taking on more features, such as massive online communities, as well as immersive virtual reality, not only leading to new kinds of games but also helping revive interest in old-style genres.  Igarashi compared that to the way Japanese movie-making has endured along with Hollywood films.  “We are just offering what we find as fun,” he said, noting that what he called his “Japanese idea of fun” can cross borders. “And we must never lose sight of that — what makes us truly us.”  In his latest game, “Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night,” the player becomes Miriam, an orphan who awakens from a coma and battles demons as she tries to end a curse that is turning her skin to crystal.  Igarashi, known as “Iga” among game fans, produced the classic “Castlevania” vampire-action game series, which started in 1997, while at major Japanese game software maker Konami until he left three years ago to be on his own.  He has raised $5.5 million in pledged funding, mostly from the U.S., on Kickstarter for his Gothic-horror “Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night.” It is set to be playable on the Switch, PC, Xbox One, PS4 and Vita, when it launches in the first half of next year in seven languages, including Chinese and Italian.  Atsushi Morita, president of Sony Interactive Entertainment Japan, Sony’s game division, said Japanese culture is at the root of visual story-telling that began with manga comic books, went on to animation and films and now allows for an interactive element in games.  Many people used to play games, Morita added, but they have stopped as they got older. But with new technology like the virtual reality headset that Sony has developed and an array of software products coming out, the time may be finally ripe for the Japanese game industry to reap the rewards, he said.  “We want people to once again remember and rediscover the fun of games,” said Morita. “We want people to re-experience that joy, that emotion.”  Square Enix Holdings Co. President Yosuke Matsuda said his company is putting out the 15th game of the longtime hit “Final Fantasy” series. Long lines were forming at its giant booth at the Tokyo Game Show for a chance to try it out.  “Japanese games are loved by the world,” he said.  ___  Kageyama can be reached at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama  Her work can be found at https://www.apnews.com/search/yuri%20kageyama",2.875,4,"[1.5, 2.5, 4.0, 3.5]"

Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, speaks with a reporter as she arrives for a vote at the Capitol in Washington.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Provisions shoehorned into the Republican health care bill dangle extra money for Alaska and Wisconsin, home states of one GOP senator whose vote party leaders desperately need and another who co-sponsored the legislation, according to analysts who’ve studied the legislation.  The 140-page measure, which top Republicans hope to push through the Senate next week, is stuffed with language making some states winners and others losers. Aides say the legislation is still changing as leaders hunt the 50 GOP “yes” votes they’ll need to turn this summer’s jarring Senate rejection of the party’s crusade to erase President Barack Obama’s law into an eleventh-hour triumph.  Alaska is home to GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who’s among a handful of Republicans who’ve not said how they’ll vote. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., is one of the bill’s co-sponsors and his support is not in question, but the episode suggests the value of helping craft of legislation.  The bill was chiefly written by GOP Sens. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham. It would end Obama’s Medicaid expansion and subsidies for people buying private insurance and combine the money into new block grants for states.  With all Democrats opposed, Republicans controlling the Senate 52-48 can lose only two votes if they are to succeed, leaving the bill’s fate uncertain. Generally, it would shift money from states that expanded their Medicaid programs for the poor under Obama’s statute, which tend to be run by Democrats, to the largely Republican-run states that shunned that expansion.  The measure would shield Alaska from some cuts it imposes on Medicaid, according to analysts, including from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, by limiting spending to a maximum amount per beneficiary starting in 2020. The federal-state program for low earners has always automatically provided whatever money is needed for eligible recipients. Montana would also qualify for the exemption.  It would also increase federal Medicaid funds for states with high American Indian populations, including Alaska, according to health care consultant April Grady.  Analysts offered no figures about how much money the provisions would mean for Alaska.  The provisions hardly ensure support from Murkowski, who’s said she’s studying how the measure would affect her state. The administration was pushing for her support, with Vice President Mike Pence calling into an Anchorage talk-radio show Thursday and urging listeners to contact Murkowski and ask her to “stand with President Trump” and support the bill.  According to studies released this week by Kaiser and the consulting firm Avalere Health, Alaska is among many states that would lose money overall under the bill. Alaska has unusually high health care costs because of the remoteness of many communities.  The provisions do not mention Alaska or Wisconsin by name.  But the bill allows a state that turned down extra federal funds to expand Medicaid under Obama’s statute to count the rejected money in determining how large its block grant will be, analysts say.  Grady, Avalere analyst Chris Sloan and others said they were unaware of states other than Wisconsin that would benefit from the provision. This language could mean “potentially hundreds of millions” of extra dollars for Wisconsin, said Grady.  In a written statement provided by aides, Johnson said funding formulas to correct “the grossly unfair” distribution of money under Obama’s law needed to be changed “to reflect the unique circumstances of many states, including recognizing the innovative reforms of Wisconsin.”  Wisconsin is among 19 states that declined to fully expand Medicaid under Obama’s law, which also provided generous federal reimbursements. Under Gov. Scott Walker, a GOP 2016 presidential contender, Wisconsin just partially expanded Medicaid and agreed to accept smaller federal subsidies.  The provision in the health care bill applies to states that expanded Medicaid only up to 100 percent of the federal poverty level and had that expansion in effect this past Sept. 1.  Since the bill’s details emerged, health industry and other groups have been lining up against it.  The National Association of Medicaid Directors, representing state officials who administer Medicaid, said it is concerned the measure would have damaging consequences on state budgets. Also announcing opposition recently was America’s Health Insurance Plans, a huge health insurers’ trade group, the American Hospital Association and the American Medical Association.  ___  Associated Press writer Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar contributed.",2.25,6,"[3.0, 0.5, 2.5, 4.5, 0.5, 2.5]"
201,1208,9,21,2017,2017-09-21,Associated Press News,"US beefs up NKorea sanctions, Kim Jong Un insults Trump","President Donald Trump listens during a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the Palace Hotel during the United Nations General Assembly, Thursday, Sept. 21, 2017, in New York. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)  NEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump added economic action to his fiery military threats against North Korea on Thursday, authorizing stiffer new sanctions in response to the Koreans’ nuclear weapons advances. Its leader Kim Jong Un issued a rare statement, branding Trump as “deranged” and warning he will “pay dearly” for his threat to “totally destroy” the North if it attacks.  The exchange of super-heated rhetoric and unusually personal abuse between the adversaries will escalate tensions that have been mounting as North Korea has marched closer to achieving a nuclear-tipped missile that could strike America. The crisis has dominated the Trump’s debut at this week’s annual U.N. General Assembly meeting.  Kim’s statement, carried by North Korea’s official news agency in a dispatch from Pyongyang early Friday, responded to Trump’s combative speech days earlier where he not only issued the warning of potential obliteration for the isolated nation, but also mocked the North’s young autocrat as a “Rocket Man” on a “suicide mission.”  Kim offered choice insults of his own.  He said Trump was “unfit to hold the prerogative of supreme command of a country.” He described the president as “a rogue and a gangster fond of playing with fire.” He characterized Trump’s speech to the world body on Tuesday as “mentally deranged behavior.”  President Trump announced Thursday he signed a new order to help the U.S. target people, companies and banks financing and facilitating trade with North Korea. He also said China has ordered its banks to stop all business with North Korea. (Sept. 21)  “I will make the man holding the prerogative of the supreme command in the U.S. pay dearly for his speech calling for totally destroying the DPRK,” said the statement carried by Korean Central News Agency.  DPRK is the abbreviation of the communist country’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.  There was no immediate response from the White House.  On Thursday in New York, Trump announced the latest steps to punish foreign companies that deal with the North. It was the latest salvo in a U.S.-led campaign to isolate and impoverish Kim’s government until it halts the missile and nuclear tests. He announced the measures as he met leaders from South Korea and Japan, the nations most immediately imperiled by North Korea’s threats of a military strike.  “North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile development is a grave threat to peace and security in our world and it is unacceptable that others financially support this criminal, rogue regime,” Trump said as he joined Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean President Moon Jae-in for lunch. “Tolerance for this disgraceful practice must end now.”  His executive order expanded the Treasury Department’s ability to target anyone conducting significant trade in goods, services or technology with North Korea, and to ban them from interacting with the U.S. financial system.  “Foreign financial institutions must choose between doing business with the United States or facilitating trade with North Korea or its designated supporters,” the order says. It also issues a 180-day ban on vessels and aircraft that have visited North Korea from visiting the United States.  Trump also said China was imposing major banking sanctions, too, but there was no immediate confirmation from the North’s most important trading partner. China’s central bank would not take questions by phone Friday and did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.  Trump praised China for instructing its banks to cut off business with Pyongyang, but neither the Chinese nor Trump officials were ready to say so. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said he had spoken at length Thursday with the head of China’s central bank but “I am not going to comment on confidential discussions.”  If enforced, the Chinese action Trump described could severely impede the isolated North’s ability to raise money for its missile and nuclear development. China, responsible for about 90 percent of North Korea’s trade, serves as the country’s conduit to the international banking system.  Trump said the China action he described “was a somewhat unexpected move and we appreciate it.”  China remains leery of pressuring North Korea into collapse and has resisted cutting off its critical oil supplies, not wanting chaos on its border. Along with Russia, China wants the U.S. to seek dialogue with the North. American officials say the time isn’t right for any formal diplomatic process. Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Thursday that negotiations are the “only way out” of the nuclear standoff.  Several news outlets this month have reported Chinese steps to restrict banking transactions, but the government hasn’t made a formal announcement. Asked for comment last week, the Foreign Ministry said China has always fully implemented U.N. sanctions on North Korea but opposes “unilateral” restrictions imposed by another country on Chinese entities. China’s embassy in Washington declined to comment Thursday.  The focus on economic measures by Washington had at least temporarily shifted focus from the talk of military action that has caused unease, even among U.S. allies. In his speech to the U.N. on Tuesday, Trump spoke of his own nation’s patience, but said that if “forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.”  Trump’s messengers backed him up in television appearances Thursday. Vice President Mike Pence told Fox News: “We do not desire a military conflict. But the president has made it very clear, as he did at the U.N. this week, that all options are on the table and we are simply not going to tolerate a rogue regime in Pyongyang obtaining usable nuclear weapons that could be mounted on a ballistic missile and threaten the people of the United States or our allies.”  Trump’s heated language was rare for a U.S. president at the rostrum of the United Nations. But the speech was textbook Trump, dividing the globe into friends and foes and taking unflinching aim at America’s enemies.  ___  Associated Press writer Darlene Superville contributed to this report.  ___  Follow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@mattpenn_99 and Lemire at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire",4.4,5,"[3.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 5.0]"

The Standard & Poor's rating agency cut China's credit rating on Thursday, Sept. 21, 2017 due to its rising debts, highlighting challenges faced by Communist leaders as they cope with slowing economic growth. (AP Photo/Andy Wong)  BEIJING (AP) — China’s Finance Ministry on Friday criticized the cut in the Standard & Poor’s rating agency’s credit rating on Chinese government borrowing as a “wrong decision” and said it ignores the country’s economic strength.  S&P announced the change Thursday, citing rising debt it said increased financial risk. The move added to warnings China’s debt burden might drag on economic growth or threaten the financial system. It followed a similar downgrade by Moody’s Investors Service in May.  The timing is awkward for the ruling Communist Party, which wants to project an image of stability ahead of a twice-a-decade congress next month at which President Xi Jinping is due to be named to a second five-year term as leader.  S&P followed its China downgrade a day later by cutting its credit rating for Hong Kong, citing risks posed by their close ties. The agency said Friday it was reducing its long-term rating on Hong Kong by one notch, to AA+ from AAA, reflecting potential spillover risks.  It said Hong Kong has a good economic outlook, sizable fiscal reserves and credible monetary policy, but that China’s downgrade is “exerting a negative impact” on Hong Kong because of “strong institutional and political ties” between them.  The Finance Ministry complained S&P ignored China’s stable economic growth and reform efforts. It noted official data showed the economy grew by 6.9 percent in the first half of 2017 over a year earlier and government revenue rose by nearly 10 percent.  “The Standard & Poor’s downgrade of China’s sovereign credit rating is a wrong decision,” the ministry said on its website. “This misreading neglects China’s good fundamentals and development potential.”  Total Chinese nongovernment debt rose last year to the equivalent of 257 percent of annual economic output, according to the Bank for International Settlements. That is unusually high for a developing country and up from 143 percent in 2008.  Communist leaders have cited reducing financial risk as a priority this year. They have launched initiatives to reduce debts owed by state companies, including by allowing banks to accept stock as repayment on loans. But private sector analysts say they are moving too slowly.  S&P lowered its rating on China’s sovereign debt by one notch from AA- to A+, still among its highest ratings.  “A prolonged period of strong credit growth has increased China’s economic and financial risks,” said S&P in a statement. That has supported economic growth but “also diminished financial stability to some extent.”  The downgrade could raise Beijing’s borrowing costs slightly but is more significant for its impact on investor sentiment.  “The new rating is still squarely investment grade — there is no real concern about the possibility of default,” said Mark Williams of Capital Economics in a report.  “However, credit continues to expand at a faster pace than output, which points to significant ongoing misallocation of resources,” said Williams. “State sector reforms have continued to disappoint and so the hidden risks on bank balance sheets have continued to build.”  Chinese economic growth fell from 14.2 percent in 2007 to 6.7 percent last year, though that still was among the world’s strongest.  The government is trying to make the economy more productive by giving market forces a bigger role. It is trying to shrink bloated industries such as steel and cement in which supply exceeds demand, which has depressed prices and led to financial losses.  Beijing is trying to steer the economy to slower, more sustainable growth based on domestic consumption instead of investment and exports. But growth has dipped faster than planners wanted, raising the risk of politically dangerous job losses. Beijing has responded by flooding the economy with credit.

Prospects are good for a public shaming, but it’s unlikely Congress will institute sweeping new regulations after hackers accessed the personal information of an estimated 143 million Americans in the Equifax data breach. (AP Photo/Mike Stewart, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Prospects are good for a public shaming in the Equifax data breach, but it’s unlikely Congress will institute sweeping new regulations after hackers accessed the personal information of an estimated 143 million Americans.  Since early this year, President Donald Trump and the Republican-led Congress have strived to curb government’s influence on businesses, arguing that regulations stifle economic growth. Lawmakers have repealed more than a dozen Obama-era rules and the House voted in June to roll back much of Dodd-Frank, the landmark banking law created after the 2008 economic crisis that was designed to prevent future meltdowns.  Several bills unveiled after Equifax are so far missing a key ingredient for success: Republican co-sponsors.  And most important, there is history. Despite numerous high-profile security breaches over the past decade at companies such as Target, Yahoo, Neiman Marcus and Home Depot, legislation that would toughen standards for storing customer data has failed to gain the necessary traction.  Jessica Rich, a vice president at Consumer Reports, said she has questioned over the years what event it would take for lawmakers to impose tougher data security regulations.  “I’m hoping this is the final wake-up call for Congress,” Rich said.  Consumer advocacy groups seek legislation that would enhance the standards for companies that store consumer data and require prompt notification to affected Americans when breaches do occur. They also seek tough civil penalties for those who break the law. But, so far, Congress has opted to let states handle the issue.  Business groups are also worried that federal regulation will stifle innovation.  “When it comes to security, attempts to regulate today will become outdated tomorrow,” said a new report from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  Senate and House Republicans say they are in fact-gathering mode before moving on any legislation. Separate hearings are scheduled the first week in October, with Equifax Chairman and CEO Richard Smith slated to testify — and likely to get a public thrashing from lawmakers.  Rep. Greg Walden, the Republican chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said he’s not ruling out new regulations as a result of the data breach at the credit agency, “but first we’ve got to get the facts.”  Democrats will be watching closely.  Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., described the Equifax breach as a test, asking on the Senate floor will “we act quickly to protect American consumers, or are we going to cave in to firms like Equifax who have spent millions of dollars lobbying to Congress for weaker rules?”  Democrats have introduced several bills. One would require credit reporting companies to place a freeze on a consumer’s credit report without charge if that company is hacked. Currently, all 50 states have laws allowing consumers to place a security freeze on their credit report, but the freeze often comes with a fee.  Chi Chi Wu, an attorney at the National Consumer Law Center, said such freezes are the single most important step consumers can take to prevent new accounts from being opened in their name.  Democrats are also using the Equifax breach to reprise more longstanding concerns about the work of credit reporting companies like Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.  Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee and 30 Democratic co-sponsors are backing legislation that would protect prospective employees from being forced to disclose their credit history as part of a job application process.  Wu said credit checks are used as warning flags about potential employees.  “A lot of people have impaired credit, black marks on their credit report because something bad happened to them,” Wu said. “It was not because they were bad or irresponsible people. They were unlucky.”  Meanwhile, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., is taking another crack at legislation designed to help consumers correct entries in their credit report.  Under her bill, creditors who send negative information to a reporting agency must also give a heads-up to the consumer. Credit reporting companies would also have to dedicate sufficient resources to handling consumers’ appeals. The appeals staff would have to meet minimum training and certification requirements.  Waters’ bill would also reduce the time that most adverse credit information may remain on reports. The time period would drop from seven to four years.  The bill reflects frequent consumer angst about the information on their credit report. Last year, Americans submitted about 54,000 complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau about credit reporting issues. Three-quarters of those complaints alleged incorrect information in credit reports.  Even if the Equifax breach fails to bring about the passage of new legislation, it has scuttled one bill in the works. On the day of Equifax’s announcement, a House subcommittee examined legislation that would have decreased the potential consequences when consumer reporting agencies falsely malign someone. Such mistakes can haunt consumers for years.  The bill would have eliminated punitive damages for violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., said the legislation was aimed at curbing frivolous lawsuits and would not have granted any immunity to Equifax for the data breach. “Nevertheless, given the unfounded attacks on me and the rampant misinformation circulating about this legislation, the Financial Services Committee has not scheduled further action on any bill at this time.”  Wu, who testified against Loudermilk’s bill, said she believes that legislation providing for the free credit freeze probably has the best chance of passage.  “I’m skeptical this particular Congress will be up for wholesale reform,” Wu said.  ___  On Twitter, reach Kevin Freking at https://twitter.com/APkfreking",3.25,8,"[5.0, 0.5, 5.0, 1.5, 3.0, 2.5, 4.0, 4.5]"

Transport for London says it won't renew a license for Uber to operate in the British capital. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File)  LONDON (AP) — Uber will lose its license to operate in London because it may be endangering public safety and security, the local regulator said Friday, in a severe blow to a company already facing big questions over its corporate culture.  The company, which has been beset by a litany of scandals over its management style — from accusations of sexism to the illegal use of software to trick regulators — was told it was not “fit and proper” to keep operating in London, where it has 3.5 million passengers and 40,000 drivers.  The regulator, Transport for London, said it “considers that Uber’s approach and conduct demonstrate a lack of corporate responsibility in relation to a number of issues which have potential public safety and security implications.”  It cited instances in which Uber failed to report serious criminal offences as well as its penchant to deceive regulators in its decision to not renew its license when it expires on Sept. 30. Uber said it will appeal, during which time it can continue operating.  The decision startled many — even though the ride-hailing business has many critics. The city’s black-cab drivers — who spend years learning the city streets to pass the famed “Knowledge” test — objected to the interlopers who undercut their business. Unions objected to the company’s treatment of its workforce.  In a city where the Labour Party is in the majority, many of these issues — particularly in terms of its treatment of employees — would have resonated with the opposition party’s voters. Labour Mayor Sadiq Khan was quick to endorse the decision of an agency he supervises.  “It’s a technical decision that picks up the spirit of the age,” said Tony Travers, an expert on local government at the London School of Economics.  Uber had been warned. Earlier this year, Transport for London renewed its license on a limited basis, giving it six months to address concerns.  Khan said that any operator of taxi services in the city “needs to play by the rules.”  “Providing an innovative service must not be at the expense of customer safety and security,” he said. “I fully support TfL’s decision — it would be wrong if TfL continued to license Uber if there is any way that this could pose a threat to Londoners’ safety and security.”  For its part, Uber accused the city of caving in to special interests “who want to restrict consumer choice.” It issued a statement to its users, starting an online petition to reverse the decision that had 375,000 signatures late Friday. Uber said the ban would show that London is closed to innovative companies.  Uber’s new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, in a note to employees obtained by The Associated Press, wrote that he disagreed with the decision but it was based on past behavior.  “The truth is that there is a high cost to a bad reputation,” he wrote. “It really matters what people think of us, especially in a global business like ours.”  If its ban is upheld, Uber will have to show that it is changing in order to get back into the lucrative London market, said Jan Dawson, chief analysts for Jackdaw Research in California.  “The fact that Uber is so mature and broadly used in London means it’s very unlikely that it will be permanently banned there - the political fallout would just be too great.”  Uber drivers like James Farrar, the chairman of the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain’s United Private Hire Drivers branch, wondered how they would pay their bills.  “This is a devastating blow,” he said, noting that many people now “face losing their job and being saddled with unmanageable vehicle-related debt.”  Uber, founded in 2010 in San Francisco, has often faced opposition as it expanded. Taxi drivers complain that Uber drivers don’t have to comply with the same licensing standards, giving the ride-hailing service an unfair advantage and placing the public at risk.  The company, which provides a smartphone application that connects passengers with drivers who work as independent contractors, argues it isn’t a traditional transportation company.  Police in London accused Uber last month of not reporting a sexual assault by a driver on a passenger, allowing the driver to strike again. Metropolitan Police Inspector Neil Billany suggested in a letter that the company was putting concerns for its reputation over public safety.  At the time, Uber said it was surprised by the letter and that it had a good working relationship with the police.  But the company has been dogged by questions on its workplace culture. In July, former CEO Travis Kalanick resigned following criticism of his management style. Some 20 people, including some managers, were fired in June amid allegations of sexual harassment and bullying.  Its aggressive corporate culture has resulted in litigation around the world. John Colley, a strategy professor at Warwick Business School, said poor values ultimately bring companies down. Uber is now largely banned from France, Spain and Belgium, and it is facing litigation and investigations around the world, he said.  “There is a very long list of businesses who have suffered for failing to uphold the level of values necessary,” Colley said. “Until Uber gets this message then it will suffer lost trade as a result of its deteriorating reputation.”  In the meantime, many Uber users could be left by the side of the road. More traditional services, like the black cabs or private-hire cars, are more expensive.  Restaurant worker Rio Kato cited the company’s cheaper rates as the reason for using Uber.  “For me it is bad news, because I work at the restaurant — a Japanese restaurant — and it finishes very late,” Kato said. “And sometimes there is no bus service, no Underground (metro), so sometimes I use Uber. If it is finished, I have a problem.”  __  Tom Krisher in Detroit contributed to this story.",3.75,4,"[5.0, 4.5, 5.0, 0.5]"

There have been lawsuits, allegations of sexual harassment and a profanity-laced outburst by its CEO that was caught on video.  Here’s a timeline of Uber’s troubles so far this year.  — Feb. 19: A former Uber engineer, Susan Fowler, discloses sexual harassment and sexism claims in a blog post about her year at Uber. Fowler says her boss propositioned her and higher-ups ignored her complaints. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick calls Fowler’s accusations “abhorrent” and hires former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate.  — Feb. 23: Waymo, a self-driving car company spun off from Google, sues Uber. Waymo alleges that a former top manager for Google’s self-driving car project stole pivotal technology from Google before leaving to run Uber’s self-driving car division.  — Feb. 28: A video emerges of Kalanick arguing with an Uber driver. It includes yelling and profanity and ends with a combative Kalanick dismissing the agitated driver’s claims that sharp reductions in fares forced him into bankruptcy. In an email to employees, Kalanick admits he needs leadership help. “I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up,” he says.  — March 3: The New York Times reveals that Uber used a phony version of its app to thwart authorities in cities where it was operating illegally. Uber’s so-called Greyball software identified regulators who were posing as riders and blocked access to them. The U.S. Justice Department is investigating Uber’s use of the Greyball software.  — March 19: Uber’s president, Jeff Jones, resigns less than a year after joining the company. He says his approach to leadership is at odds with what he experienced at Uber.  — May 11: A federal judge in San Francisco refers Waymo’s case to the U.S. Attorney’s office for a possible criminal investigation. Days later, the judge bans Uber from using technology taken from Waymo, but doesn’t order Uber to halt its self-driving vehicle program. The case is set for trial in October.  — May 31: Uber’s finance chief Gautam Gupta says he plans to leave the company in July.  — June 6: Uber fires 20 people after a law firm, Perkins Coie, investigates complaints of harassment, bullying and retaliation. That investigation, which was separate from Holder’s, checked into 215 complaints.  — June 11: Uber’s board meets with Holder and adopts a series of recommendations based on his report.  — June 12: Emil Michael, Uber’s senior vice president for business and a close ally of Kalanick, leaves the company. Michael and another executive who was ousted, Uber’s Asia chief Eric Alexander, were sued by an Uber passenger who was raped in India. The passenger accused Michael and Alexander of obtaining her medical records in an attempt to defame her.  — June 13: Kalanick says he’s taking a leave for an unspecified period. Uber’s board releases Holder’s recommendations, which include removing some of Kalanick’s responsibilities and replacing Uber’s chairman and founder, Garrett Camp, with an independent chairman. Holder also recommends many cultural and policy changes, from establishing an effective complaint process to recruiting more diverse applicants.  — June 13: Uber board member David Bonderman resigns after making a sexist remark at an employee meeting.  — June 20: Uber embarks on “180 days of change,” seeking to persuade riders and investors that it is a company with a conscience. The first move was allowing riders the ability to give drivers tips through the Uber app.  — June 21: Kalanick resigns under pressure from investors and the board. He stays on as board member.  — July 13: Uber cedes control of the Russian market by agreeing to merge its local business with Yandex.  — Aug. 28: Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi is named as the new CEO.  — Sept. 22: London’s transport authority says it will not renew Uber’s license after Sept. 30, citing a lack of corporate responsibility.

But negotiators must grapple with the reality that any handouts to Democrats quickly could turn into turn-offs for the GOP. (AP Photo/Brynn Anderson)  WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump says he wants to lure Democratic lawmakers to sign on to a Republican-crafted tax overhaul plan but negotiators must deal with the reality that any handouts to Democrats could quickly turn into turnoffs for the GOP.  The White House and tax-writing Republican leaders are expected to begin filling in some of the details this coming week on Trump’s plan to simplify the tax system, a legislative priority for the president. The White House views this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to simplify taxes and cut rates, while giving Trump a much-needed victory as the Republicans struggle to overturn the Obama health care law.  The specifics are taking shape. Trump’s efforts to draw in a few Democrats could mean “you’re going to lose a few Republicans,” said Mark Weinberger, CEO of the accounting firm EY. But he added: “He wants to get 51 votes period in the Senate ... so it is possible you might lose a few Republicans and pick up a few Democrats who are in states that Trump won.”  While the plan is not finalized, Trump is already planning to promote it heavily. He will travel to Indiana on Wednesday, and aides are discussing a televised speech, according to people familiar with White House plans.  People familiar with the plan being written entirely by Republicans said the administration is considering lowering the corporate tax rate from its current 35 percent to somewhere in the low 20s. The plan probably would seek tax cuts across the board for individuals and reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three. The administration is considering whether to repeal the estate tax, long a Republican cause, according to these people, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations still underway.  Republican leaders had promised an overhaul that would not add to the deficit. Republicans are talking about cuts whose costs would be justified by assumptions of greater economic growth.  Lawmakers on the House Ways and Means Committee planned to meet Sunday night and Monday to discuss taxes, and House Republicans are set to meet privately away from the Capitol on Wednesday, according to aides familiar with the plans.  The White House initially pushed hard to overhaul taxes with only Republican support. But in recent months, people involved with tax discussions have found that Republican lawmakers — beyond a general desire to cut rates and simplify the tax system — also have their own divisions. The result is that Trump has been unable to deliver a tax overhaul with concrete details.  “There are Republicans, there are base Republicans, there are Trump Republicans, there are progressive Democrats, there are Blue Dog Democrats,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former director of the Congressional Budget Office. “There is no way to move one way or the other and not lose someone on the other end of the spectrum.”  Trump has bargained on other issues with Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California. But the tax plan has been developed in private with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, White House economic adviser Gary Cohen, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the two Republicans leading the major tax-writing committees — Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah and Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas.  Republicans will need to agree on a companion budget plan to get the tax effort off the ground. A series of fights awaits once the administration details the plan, including whether to limit or eliminate the itemized deduction for state and local taxes.  White House advisers expect Trump to rally support for the plan by visiting states with Democratic senators that he won last year, and states in Rust Belt such as Pennsylvania and Ohio that powered his victory. Critics of the emerging plan say it will take more than that to bring Democrats on board.  “Simply going to a red state with a blue senator and saying she better support my tax cut doesn’t strike me as a very powerful weapon at all when the tax cut is a nice big fat package for wealthy people that does nothing for the working class,” said Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden and a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.  In his early effort to build broader support for a tax plan, Trump has focused on Democrats such as Sens. Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota during trips to their home states, which both delivered major victories for Trump in the 2016 election.  Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said in an interview that he has told Trump he’s “very receptive to reducing the corporate tax to the 25 (percent) range,” and described some of the early discussions over components of the plan as “very doable.”  But Manchin said he told the president the plan would need to be fiscally responsible. “One thing we don’t need to raise is more debt,” Manchin said.  Sen. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., who dined with Trump and other senators earlier this month, has urged the president to make sure the tax plan addresses the outsourcing of jobs and includes provisions supporting companies that invest in U.S. jobs and penalize those that ship jobs overseas. Vice President Mike Pence pushed Donnelly during a visit to the state Friday, saying “Sen. Donnelly, we need your help too.”  Heitkamp, a former North Dakota tax commissioner, has pointed to the complexities involved in any overhaul and said she’ll need to see more details.  ___  Associated Press writer Josh Boak contributed to this report.",3.5,10,"[5.0, 4.0, 0.5, 3.5, 5.0, 2.0, 4.5, 4.0, 5.0, 1.5]"

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Unwilling to concede defeat on a bedrock GOP promise, President Donald Trump on Saturday tried to sway two Republican holdouts on the party’s last-ditch health care hope while clawing at his nemesis who again has brought the “Obamacare” repeal-and-replace effort to the brink of failure.  Trump appealed to Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a possible “no” vote, to swing around for the sake of Alaskans up in arms over high insurance costs, and suggested that Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul might reverse his stated opposition “for the good of the Party!”  Arizona Sen. John McCain, whose announcement Friday that he would not vote for the proposal seemingly scuttled efforts to revive the repeal, came under renewed criticism from the White House. It was the second time in three months that McCain, at 81 in the twilight of a remarkable career and battling brain cancer, had emerged as the destroyer of his party’s signature and yearslong pledge to voters on health care.  “He campaigned on Repeal & Replace. Let Arizona down!” Trump tweeted. He jabbed at the senator with another tweet later in the day: “Democrats are laughingly saying that McCain had a “moment of courage.” Tell that to the people of Arizona who were deceived. 116% increase!”  Trump told those at a rally that Obamacare will be repealed. The president also took a jab at NFL players who protest during the National Anthem at games. (Sept. 22)  The effort to rally support for the bill took another hit Saturday when the nation’s doctors, hospitals and health insurance plans unified in opposition to it. In a joint statement, major groups such as the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, America’s Health Insurance Plans and the BlueCross BlueShield Association called on the Senate to reject the bill and said, “Health care is too important to get wrong.”  With Senate Democrats unanimously opposed, two is the exact number of GOP votes that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., can afford to lose. McCain and Paul are in the “no” column, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, is leaning against the bill and Murkowksi is also a possible “no.”  But Trump isn’t letting go, as seen by his series of tweets while he spends the weekend at his New Jersey golf club.  Aiming at Murkowski, Trump cited increases in premiums and other costs in Alaska under the Affordable Care Act. “Deductibles high, people angry! Lisa M comes through,” he wrote.  Trump, without offering support for his assertion about former presidential rival Paul, said: “I know Rand Paul and I think he may find a way to get there for the good of the Party!”  But there was no doubt where Trump stood on McCain.  “John McCain never had any intention of voting for this Bill,” Trump said. The measure was co-written by South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, McCain’s closest Senate ally, and Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La.  “McCain let his best friend L.G. down!” Trump said, adding that the health bill was “great for Arizona.”  McCain, in explaining that he could not “in good conscience” vote for the legislation, said both parties “could do better working together” but hadn’t “really tried.” He also he could not support the measure “without knowing how much it will cost, how it will affect insurance premiums, and how many people will be helped or hurt by it.”  His opposition all but ensured a major setback for Trump and McConnell, and appeared likely to deepen rifts between congressional Republicans and a president who has begun making deals with Democrats out of frustration with his own party’s failure to turn proposals into laws.  During the election campaign Trump had pledged to quickly kill the Affordable Care Act — “It will be easy,” he contended — and he has publicly chided McConnell for not winning passage before now.  Up until McCain’s announcement, McConnell allies were optimistic McCain’s relationship with Graham might make the difference. GOP leaders hoped to bring the legislation to the full Senate this coming week. They face a Sept. 30 deadline, at which point special rules that prevent a Democratic filibuster will expire.  Democrats hailed McCain’s announcement and pledged to commit to the bipartisan process he sought. GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington have been working on a package of limited legislative fixes to the health law’s marketplaces.  “John McCain shows the same courage in Congress that he showed when he was a naval aviator,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. “I have assured Sen. McCain that as soon as repeal is off the table, we Democrats are intent on resuming the bipartisan process.”  Trump charged that Schumer “sold John McCain a bill of goods. Sad.”  The Graham-Cassidy bill would repeal major pillars of the health law and replace them with block grants to states to design their own programs.  “Large Block Grants to States is a good thing to do. Better control & management,” Trump tweeted.  But major medical groups said millions of people would lose insurance coverage and protections. A bipartisan group of governors announced their opposition.  The House passed its own repeal bill back in May, prompting Trump to convene a Rose Garden celebration, which soon began to look premature.  After the Senate failed in several attempts in July, the legislation looked dead. But Cassidy kept at it with his state-focused approach, and the effort caught new life in recent weeks as the deadline neared. Trump pushed hard, hungry for a win.  The bill would get rid of unpopular mandates for people to carry insurance or face penalties. It would repeal the financing for Obama’s health insurance expansion and create a big pot of money states could tap to set up their own programs, with less federal oversight. It would limit spending for Medicaid, the federal-state program that now covers more than 70 million low-income people. Insurance rules that protect people with pre-existing conditions could be loosened through state waivers.  Over time, the legislation would significantly reduce federal health care dollars now flowing to the states. But McConnell had little margin for error in a Senate split 52-48 between Republicans and Democrats, and could lose only two votes, counting on Pence to break the tie.  ___  Associated Press writers Erica Werner, Alan Fram and Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar in Washington contributed to this report.",3.8333333333333335,9,"[3.5, 2.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 3.5, 2.5]"

(AP Photo/Francois Mori)  PARIS (AP) — French far-left firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon urged protesters Saturday to take to the streets and mount strikes to force President Emmanuel Macron to withdraw the labor law changes that are key to his business-friendly economic vision.  Speaking to tens of thousands in Paris, Melenchon assailed the president’s new labor decrees as a gift to greedy corporations and the financial markets that have both fueled income inequality.  Macron, for his part, says the decrees are crucial to creating jobs and tackling France’s chronic high unemployment.  “The battle isn’t over — it is beginning,” Melenchon told the crowd packed onto the Place de la Republique in eastern Paris.  Earlier, marchers stretched along Paris boulevards waving French tricolor flags, union banners and signs reading “Macron, Resign!”  “It’s the street that brought down the kings. It’s the street that brought down the Nazis,” said Melenchon, who is trying to position himself as France’s main opposition figure.  The labor decrees that Macron signed Friday reduce French unions’ influence over workplace rules and make it easier for companies to fire workers — but Saturday’s demonstration reflected wider frustration with the new French president’s leadership.  “Everything that’s done in terms of fiscal policies is in favor of the rich, the wealthy and big companies,” complained marcher Cedric Moulinier, 26. “We’re asking for things to start going the right way, a more social, humanist and environmentalist way.”  Many were angry at a reference Macron made to the “lazy” people who opposed the changes.  While the president has already signed the decrees and they are expected to be ratified by parliament soon, Melenchon still insisted it is not too late to overturn them.  He said he would reach out to unions to join forces against the labor decrees, which he said threaten the French way of life.  “All of Europe is watching us. .... What is happening is the battle for France,” he said.  The crowd, which police estimated at 30,000 and organizers estimated at 150,000, repeatedly broke into chants of “Resistance!” or “Get out!”  The protesters are also angry that Macron used a special procedure allowing the government to change labor law by executive order instead going through a lengthy debate to pass a bill in parliament.  Macron lauded the “unprecedented wave of changes” to France’s social model, along with changes to unemployment benefits and a training plan for jobless people that will be set up next year.  While Macron shone at the U.N. General Assembly in New York last week and has made a strong mark on the international stage, he has struggled with myriad critics at home. Farmers, riot police and carnival workers have held protests in recent weeks over work policy changes under Macron, and truckers plan road blockades on Monday.  Among Melenchon’s suggestions to pressure the government to withdraw the reforms is a “pots and pans party.”  “Grab your pots next Saturday to make as much noise as possible,” he said. “This is what our message will be: You make our lives miserable.

Even less is known about her manufacturers. Trump’s brand, which is still owned by the first daughter and presidential adviser, declined to disclose the information.  The deepening secrecy means it’s unclear who Ivanka Trump’s company is doing business with in China, even as she and her husband, Jared Kushner, have emerged as important conduits for top Chinese officials in Washington. The lack of disclosure makes it difficult to understand whether foreign governments could use business ties with her brand to try to influence the White House — and whether her company stands to profit from foreign government subsidies that can destroy American jobs. Such questions are especially pronounced in China, where state-owned and state-subsidized companies dominate large swaths of commercial activity.  It's no secret that the bulk of Ivanka Trump merchandise comes from China. But an AP investigation has found it's more difficult than ever to identify the Chinese companies her brand does business with, raising concerns on a number of fronts. (Sept. 26)  “There should be more transparency, but right now we do not have the legal mechanism to enforce transparency unless Congress requests information through a subpoena,” said Richard Painter, who served as chief White House ethics lawyer for George W. Bush, and is part of a lawsuit against President Donald Trump for alleged constitutional violations. “I don’t know how much money she’s making on this and why it’s worth it. I think it’s putting our trade policy in a very awkward situation.”  An AP review of the records that are available about Ivanka Trump’s supply chain found two potential red flags. In one case, a province in eastern China announced the award of export subsidies to a company that shipped thousands of Ivanka Trump handbags between March 2016 and February of this year, Chinese public records show — a possible violation by China of global fair trade rules, trade experts said.  The AP also found that tons of Ivanka Trump clothing were exported from 2013 to 2015 by a company owned by the Chinese government, according to public records and trade data. It is unclear whether the brand is still working with that company, or other state-owned entities. Her brand has pledged to avoid business with state-owned companies now that she’s a White House adviser, but contends that its supply chains are not its direct responsibility.  Ivanka Trump’s brand doesn’t actually make its products directly. Instead, it contracts with licensees who oversee production of her merchandise. In exchange, those licensees pay the brand royalties. The AP asked Ivanka Trump’s brand for a list of its suppliers. The company declined to disclose them. The clothing, footwear and handbag licensees contacted by AP also declined to reveal source factories.  Trump’s Democratic opponents have previously faulted Ivanka Trump for outsourcing the production of her company’s branded goods to Chinese factories with questionable working conditions. On Tuesday, Democratic National Committee spokesman Daniel Wessel cited the AP’s reporting to argue that the secrecy around her brand’s subcontracting relationships could conceal potential conflicts of interest.  “What we don’t know is the extent to which foreign governments could use, or are already using, her business ties to try to influence the White House,” he said.  Abigail Klem, president of IT Operations LLC, which manages Ivanka Trump’s brand, said the company does not contract with foreign state-owned companies or benefit from Chinese government subsidies. However, she acknowledged that its licensees might.  “We license the rights to our brand name to licensing companies that have their own supply chains and distribution networks,” Klem said in an email. “The brand receives royalties on sales to wholesalers and would not benefit if a licensee increased its profit margin by obtaining goods at a lower cost,” she added.  But Michael Stone, chairman of Beanstalk, a global brand licensing agency, said lower production costs for licensees would ultimately benefit Ivanka Trump by freeing up money for marketing or lower retail prices, both of which drive sales.  “It gives her a competitive advantage and an indirect benefit to her financially,” Stone said. “The more successful the licensee is the more successful Ivanka Trump is going to be.”  The AP identified companies that sent Ivanka Trump products to the United States by looking at shipment data maintained by ImportGenius and Panjiva Inc., private companies that independently track global trade. Panjiva’s records show that 85 percent of shipments of her goods to the U.S. this year originated in China and Hong Kong, but beyond that, it’s becoming more difficult to map the brand’s global footprint.  The companies that shipped Ivanka Trump merchandise to the U.S. are listed for just five of 57 shipments logged by Panjiva from the end of March, when she officially became a presidential adviser, through mid-September. Panjiva collects data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which did not immediately release the missing data to AP.  While in many cases the manufacturer ships goods directly, merchandise can also be made by one company and shipped by another trading or consolidation company.  There used to be more visibility. Last year, 27 percent of the companies that exported Ivanka Trump merchandise to the U.S. were identified in Panjiva’s records, and back in 2014 a full 95 percent were named. For two of Ivanka Trump’s licensees — G-III Apparel Group Ltd. and Marc Fisher Footwear — the number of shipments appears to plunge in 2015, likely because they “requested to hide” their shipment activity, according to Panjiva records. Neither company responded to AP’s questions.  The brand declined to comment on the growing murkiness of its supply chain.  Chris Rogers, an analyst at Panjiva, said any company can ask customs authorities to redact its information for any reason. About a quarter of companies request anonymity, he said, but the majority don’t mind disclosing who they’re doing business with.  “A lot of companies have said, ‘yes there might be a commercial disadvantage, but we want to be transparent about our supply chain,’” he explained. ”‘Why would we want to cover up the fact that we’re working with this particular company?’”  While ethics lawyers may see disclosure as the best antidote to conflict of interest, many brands see it as a tool to keep supply chains scandal-free. Public outcry over sweatshop conditions and worker suicides prompted companies like Nike Inc. and Apple Inc. to disclose the names and addresses of their manufacturers, and a growing number, including Gap Inc., the H&M Group, New Balance Athletics Inc., Adidas AG and Levi Strauss & Co., publicly identify their suppliers.  Ivanka Trump should do the same, said Allen Adamson, founder and CEO of BrandSimple Consulting. “It’s a missed opportunity to lead by example.”  What shipping records do show is that a company called Zhejiang Tongxiang Foreign Trade Group Co. Ltd., a sprawling conglomerate once majority-owned by the Chinese state, sent at least 30 tons of Ivanka Trump handbags to the U.S. between March 2016 and February.  Zhejiang province’s commerce department said in June 2014 that it would help lower export costs for that same company, along with nine other local enterprises, through a special three-year trade promotion program. Among the measures outlined were export insurance subsidies and funding for online trading platforms and international marketing, as well as special funds earmarked for foreign trade companies with large-scale, fast-growing exports.  The value of the subsidies is unclear, as are details about how the directives were implemented, but using subsidies to reduce the price of exports is considered so destructive to fair trade that the World Trade Organization generally bans the practice. Chinese government subsidies hurt American workers but can lower costs for U.S. companies that import made-in-China merchandise, potentially boosting their profits. President Donald Trump has called companies that benefit from foreign government subsidies “cheaters.”  The AP spoke with four trade experts in the United States and China who said the Zhejiang measures appeared to violate World Trade Organization rules. “These are clearly export subsidies,” said Gary Hufbauer, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.  Zhejiang province’s Department of Commerce and the Zhejiang Tongxiang Foreign Trade Group declined comment.  The AP also found that from Oct. 2013 to Jan. 2015, Jiangsu High Hope International Group Corp., a conglomerate majority-owned by the Jiangsu provincial government, shipped 45 tons of Ivanka Trump clothing to the U.S., according to records from ImportGenius and Panjiva.  High Hope told AP it had “a small number of business dealings” with Ivanka Trump licensee G-III Apparel, but declined to answer questions about whether the relationship is ongoing.  G-III, which is based in New York City, declined to respond to specific questions but said in a statement that it is “committed to legal compliance and ethical business practices in all of our operations worldwide.” Ivanka Trump licensee Mondani Handbags & Accessories Inc., also headquartered in New York, did not respond to requests for comment.  Ivanka Trump’s brand said it was in the process of reviewing its supply chains with the help of “independent experts whose mission it is to advance human rights” and emphasized that all licensees, manufacturers, subcontractors and suppliers are required to abide by the law, as well as ethical practices set forth in a vendor code of conduct.  The AP asked to see the code of conduct, but the brand declined to share it.  ___  Associated Press researchers Fu Ting in Shanghai and Yu Bing in Beijing, and reporter Jeff Horwitz in Washington contributed to this report.  ___  Follow Kinetz on Twitter at twitter.com/ekinetz  Send news tips, documents, etc. securely and confidentially to AP at https://securedrop.ap.org/",2.5,10,"[1.5, 5.0, 3.5, 1.5, 2.5, 0.5, 4.0, 4.5, 1.5, 0.5]"

Authorities said that the owner of the privately owned Enrique Rebsamen school built an apartment for herself on top of the collapsed wing, which local media said included a Jacuzzi, and were looking into whether the extra weight may have played a role in the collapse. (AP Photo/Carlos Cisneros, File)  MEXICO CITY (AP) — On paper at least, the Mexico City school appeared to be structurally sound and built to withstand a major earthquake. But it collapsed, killing 26 people, most of them children. And now authorities are looking into whether an apartment reportedly built on top of the two-story school was to blame.  Claudia Sheinbaum, the borough president of the southern Mexico City district where the school went down in the 7.1 magnitude quake, told a news conference Tuesday that the school appeared to have its paperwork in order, at least according to documents filed by architects and engineers who supposedly inspected the structure. She said an investigation was being launched to look for any abnormalities not revealed in those documents.  “We can’t stop just with the paperwork,” Sheinbaum said. “We are going to do a review of the building itself.”  Authorities said that the owner of the privately owned Enrique Rebsamen school built an apartment for herself on top of the collapsed wing, which local media said included a Jacuzzi, and were looking into whether the extra weight may have played a role in the collapse.  Sheinbaum said she didn’t know if that was true, but said the owner, Mónica García Villegas, had a permit dating back to 1983 to build a school and apartments on the lot, though it was unclear whether she had permission to add a third story to the section of the school that collapsed.  The school was just one of dozens of buildings that collapsed in the Sept. 19 quake that killed at least 333 people, 194 of them in Mexico City. Questions have been raised about whether new building standards put in place after a 1985 quake that killed 9,500 people had been adequately followed.  Although construction began on the school in 1983 — two years before the new codes went into effect — it was expanded over the next 34 years with no evidence of noncompliance, Sheinbaum said. She said the only immediately evident paper work problems during that time were two cases of unregistered expansion work, and Garcia Villegas paid a fine for not registering the work and was allowed to proceed.  On Tuesday, Meyer Klip Gervita, head of the Institute of Administrative Verification, said that earlier this year authorities had asked the school to stop operating because no record of its zoning permit could be found. But the school appealed and remained open while the case made its way through court. The apparent violation was not enough to force the school’s closure. The institute was created to ensure compliance with city building ordinances among other responsibilities.  Phone calls to a number registered to Garcia Villegas, who was pulled alive from the rubble, rang unanswered.  Seismologists and engineers say the Mexico City buildings most at risk in a quake are those, like the school building, that were built atop an Aztec-era lake bed, where the muddy soil can amplify earthquake waves.  But, although an architect signed a document certifying the school was structurally sound, experts questioned the method used to evaluate it, which Sheinbaum said involved piling sandbags on its upper floors to simulate 85 percent of the structure’s maximum design-carrying weight, and then measuring the resulting floor sag.  Kit Miyamoto, a structural engineer and California Seismic Safety Commissioner, said sandbags can’t test for earthquake resistance.  “Seismic is a lateral force, so if you just put a whole bunch of sandbags it is not going to tell you the story of the seismic capacity of the building at all,” Miyamoto said. “You can do testing, to determine what kind of reinforcement” a building has, including ground-penetrating radar or exposing rebar.  The school’s first wing was built in 1983, but other additions and floors were added over the years, said Francisco Garcia Alvarez, president of the Mexican Society of Structural Engineers, who evaluated the school site after its collapse.  A third floor appeared to have been added recently to the original 1983 structure that was toppled in the quake, raising questions about what construction permits, if any, the school had obtained, how recently it had been inspected and what architectural plans were submitted in the first place. Paper work filed as recently as June by a private architect working for the school asserted that the parcel had not been modified in a way that would violate the permitted land use.  The quake, whose epicenter was only about 100 miles from the capital, hit the city’s south side where the school is located with a force much stronger than the original school structure was built to withstand in the early 1980s, Garcia Alvarez said.  That caused a failure in the building’s joints where the columns met the beams, he said, noting that the addition of a third floor would have added more weight to the structure. Still, he said, its possible role in the collapse needed further study.  Sheinbaum, who is widely expected to run for mayor, faces heightened political scrutiny over the school’s collapse, which killed 19 children and seven adults, leaving behind a pile of wreckage still visible in a cordoned-off street of the leafy neighborhood manned by soldiers.  “We all just keep working, but then all of a sudden it hits you,” said Alfonso Martinez, one of hundreds of volunteers who have been ferrying shovels, hard hats, food and water to rescue workers since the earthquake struck last week. “People are going in and out of grief about all the lives that were lost.”  Neighbors said that the school had grown quickly over the years and they had noted new construction. “We saw there was a third floor put on there but we didn’t suspect someone was living there,” said Juan Antonio Gudino. “I just thought it was an office.”  Across Mexico City, some 40 buildings collapsed in the earthquake and some 500 others were so severely damaged they will either have to be demolished or receive major structural reinforcement, according to Mexico City Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera. Another 1,300 are reparable, and about 10,000 buildings inspected so far were found to be habitable.  Still, experts stressed that reforms to building codes following the 1985 earthquake had lowered the number of casualties. But, they said, more needed to be done to ensure compliance.  “From what we can tell the new codes worked well, and helped avoid more harm,” said Eduardo Miranda, a professor in Stanford University’s civil and structural engineering department, who evaluated buildings following the quake. “But some of these buildings may have failed because people did not follow the codes.”  Unlike in the United States, where city engineers typically check architectural drawings for structural integrity, authorities in Mexico City perform an administrative check of submitted plans, but don’t vet structural calculations, he said.  Two blocks from the school, bouquets of white chrysanthemums line a makeshift memorial with the names of those pulled from the wreckage — a reminder of the tragedy that befell the school.  “We were all focused on following the code,” Sheinbaum said. “We are all asking ourselves if we could have done more.”  ___  Associated Press writer Mark Stevenson contributed to this report.",3.1818181818181817,11,"[4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 2.5, 5.0, 1.5, 0.5, 4.5, 2.5, 3.5, 2.5]"
218,1319,9,26,2017,2017-09-26,Associated Press News,EU official Tusk: No sufficient progress in Brexit talks," Brexit talks haven’t yet made sufficient progress to begin negotiating a new relationship between Britain and the European Union, European Council President Donald Tusk said Tuesday. But Tusk said he’s now “cautiously optimistic” about the way ahead.  After meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May in London, Tusk said he believed Britain had finally abandoned its unrealistic “having a cake and eating it” approach to Brexit.  Britain triggered a two-year countdown to leaving the EU in March, but since then talks have made little progress. Negotiators are meeting in Brussels this week for a fourth round of discussions, as EU officials warn Britain that time is running out.  Britain is keen to start discussing future trade and security relations with the bloc, a move that would alleviate some of the uncertainty rattling the British economy. But EU officials say those talks can’t happen until there has been “sufficient progress” on the terms of the divorce.  In a bid to break the logjam, May made a conciliatory speech Friday in Florence, Italy, saying the U.K. would be willing to pay into EU coffers during a two-year transition phase after it formally leaves the bloc in March 2019.  Tusk said Tuesday he felt Britain had finally abandoned an unrealistic belief that it could leave the EU while keeping all the advantages of membership.  “I feel cautiously optimistic about the constructive and more realistic tone in the prime minister’s speech in Florence and of our discussion today,” Tusk said after meeting May at 10 Downing St.  “There is no sufficient progress yet, but we will work on it,” he added.  Other EU officials also gave a cautious welcome to May’s speech, but said more details are needed. Chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said Monday he was “keen and eager” to understand how May’s words would be turned into a negotiating strategy.  May’s office said the Florence speech had been intended to create momentum in the talks and “it was important for EU negotiators to now respond in the same spirit.”  The EU insists it won’t discuss future relationships until it has guarantees on Britain’s outstanding financial commitments, on the rights of more than 4 million EU and British citizens affected by Brexit and on the status of the Irish border.  EU leaders are to assess at an Oct. 19-20 meeting whether Britain has made “sufficient progress” on the divorce arrangements for negotiations to move on. It’s likely they will decide it’s too soon and will reassess the decision in December.  In another sign of Britain’s more conciliatory tone, U.K. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson tried to reassure eastern Europeans that they will remain welcome. Brexit will end the automatic right of EU nationals to live and work in the U.K., and that has left many of the 3 million EU citizens in Britain worried for their futures.  Johnson told Romania’s Agerpres news agency that the estimated 500,000 Romanians currently in Britain are “hugely valued members of our society.”  “We would be crazy to let them go back to Romania, we want to ensure ... their rights are protected,” said Johnson, who is on a visit to the Czech Republic, Romania and Slovakia.  Johnson also seemed to have changed his tune since July, when he said the EU could “go whistle” if it wanted a big exit payment from Britain.  “We’re putting some money on the table,” Johnson said, adding that Britain would “continue to honor our commitments” to the EU.  ___  Alison Mutler in Bucharest, Romania, contributed to this story.",3.2916666666666665,12,"[2.5, 4.0, 5.0, 4.5, 5.0, 2.5, 5.0, 4.0, 1.5, 2.5, 1.5, 1.5]"

(AP Photo/Alastair Grant, Pool, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Friday that he has held four meetings to discuss who should lead the Federal Reserve starting early next year and expects to decide within two or three weeks.  Trump made the disclosure in comments to reporters on the White House lawn. He did not name the candidates he has met with. But a White House official said the president and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had met Thursday with Kevin Warsh, a former Fed board member.  Another report said Trump had also met with Jerome Powell, the only Republican on the Fed board.  The White House official who discussed Trump’s meeting with Warsh spoke on condition of anonymity to talk about a private White House meeting. The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump and Mnuchin have also met with Powell.  Trump has said previously that he is considering re-nominating Chair Janet Yellen when her term ends in February. But he has said he is also looking at other candidates including Gary Cohn, the head of Trump’s National Economic Council.  Warsh, who served on the board from 2006 to 2011, was a key adviser to Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke during the 2008 financial crisis. He is married to Jane Lauder, granddaughter of cosmetics giant Estee Lauder. Her father, Ronald Lauder is a longtime Trump friend.  Warsh was 35 when he was nominated by President George W. Bush to serve on the board in January 2010. He is now a distinguished visiting fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institute and a lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.  Trump told reporters earlier this month that he liked and respected Yellen but had not yet decided on the Fed job. Trump had been critical during the presidential campaign of Yellen’s performance but has made only favorable comments about her since the election.  In an interview this summer, Trump mentioned Cohn as another candidate for the Fed job. But Cohn’s prospects appeared to dim after he was publicly critical in August of Trump’s response to the protest violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.  Cohn and Mnuchin have taken the lead in crafting the administration’s tax plan, which was unveiled Wednesday.  Yellen, asked last week whether she had met with Trump recently, said she had not done so since a brief discussion the two had after Trump took office. Yellen has repeatedly said she plans to serve out her current term but has declined to say whether she would accept another four-year term if asked to so do by Trump.  It is possible that Trump’s four meetings were with Yellen, Cohn, Warsh and Powell, though Trump did not provide names.  One other person who has been mentioned for the top Fed job is John Taylor, a Stanford University economist and a favorite of conservatives for his support for a rules-based approach to setting interest-rate policies.  There are three vacancies on the Fed board, and there will soon be a fourth. Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer plans to step down in October. So far, Trump has moved to fill only one of the vacancies, nominating Randal Quarles to the board to be vice chairman for bank supervision.

(Héctor Alejandro Santiago via AP)  For 21 years Hector Alejandro Santiago spread joy throughout Puerto Rico with the poinsettias, orchids and other ornamental plants he raised and sold to major retailers including Costco, Walmart and Home Depot. In a matter of hours Hurricane Maria wiped it away.  The greenhouses and other buildings on the 40 acres where he grew the plants and prepared them for customers lie in tatters, ripped to shreds by 155 mph (244 kph) winds and driving rain. Trees are flattened.  “I will need to begin from zero,” said Santiago, 43, whose Cali Nurseries is located in Barranquitas, a small mountain city 34 miles (55 kilometers) southwest of San Juan. He’s determined to rebuild and get back into business despite the losses he estimates at $1.5 million.  Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico on Sept. 20 as a Category 4 storm, the strongest to hit the island in a century. At least 16 people died and nearly all 3.4 million people on the island were left without power and most without water.  The hurricane devastated agriculture, a small bright spot of economic growth in a U.S. territory mired in a decade-long recession and crushing debt.  While most of the island’s food is imported, statistics from the governor as of late 2016 show about 7,000 people working in agriculture, farm income growing and acres under cultivation up 50 percent over the past four years.  Agricultural income is divided nearly equally between crop and livestock production, according to the most recent Census of Agriculture compiled by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for Puerto Rico in 2012.  Crop sales generate about $271 million a year led by production of plantains, vegetables and melons, nursery and greenhouse crops, fruits and coffee. Livestock sales are about $276 million led by milk production, poultry and cattle, the report said.  Noel Lopez, 40, operates 10 dairy farms with his father and brother. Before the storm they were milking 12,000 cows, producing 22,000 gallons (85,000 liters) of milk a day. Maria destroyed 90 percent of the barns and as many as 700 cows are missing or dead, each one valued at $2,500.  Without electricity, Lopez spent days after the storm focusing on finding enough diesel fuel to keep generators running so the cows could be milked and the milk could be kept cool. Failure to milk the cows could lead to an infection that could kill them and the milk can spoil within days without refrigeration.  Lopez said he has managed to get back into operation.  “A lot of people will never be able to get back to business,” he said. “The ones that will be able to get back into business will never be as they were.”  Jayson Harper, a professor of agricultural economics at Penn State University, spent three months in Puerto Rico in 2014 and said the hurricane has destroyed the high value crops that farmers produce, some which take years to replace.  The losses are different from crops in the Midwest, where a tornado could take out a field of corn. It’s a major loss but the farmer can replant the next year. Coffee trees, when destroyed by wind, take several years to mature enough to produce beans again.  “It’s a very large investment and it’s just a different kind of situation,” Harper said.  The coffee industry was hit at the worst time, just before the beans are picked, said Eva Legner, who with her husband Kurt operates Hacienda Pomarrosa in Ponce, a city on the island’s southern coast where they have 8 acres of coffee plants.  The couple operates a small specialty coffee growing operation and a cottage where guests can stay on the coffee farm, tour the field and experience production. It is part of the island’s growing agri-tourism industry.  She said the storm cut right through the island’s mountainous coffee-growing area. The specialty beans their farm produces grow on bushes that are planted beneath taller trees to protect them from direct sun.  “We’ve lost many trees which fell on the bushes and broke them,” Legner said. “My husband tells me we lost a complete harvest.”  Santiago, the ornamental plants farmer, said he was unable to get to his farm for five days after Maria. When he arrived he found his employees had been working since the first day.  “I just started crying, I choked up, when I saw them working like nothing had happened,” Santiago said. “They give me the strength to not give up and to do whatever I have to do to continue with my business.”",2.55,10,"[4.5, 1.5, 3.5, 2.0, 2.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 2.5, 4.5]"

The European Union is looking beyond its impending breakup with Britain at how to build a common future with the 27 nations remaining in the bloc. (AP Photo/Virginia Mayo)  TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Twenty-seven European Union nations, excluding Britain, will be coming up with clear options on a more tightly knit future for themselves even before they will allow divorce negotiations with the U.K. to move toward brokering a new relationship.  EU Council President Donald Tusk said Friday he would be presenting “a political agenda in two weeks’ time,” after EU vision statements in recent weeks from French President Emmanuel Macron, EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and others on how to the reform the bloc.  That will be just days before the next EU summit, which is expected to reject for now British demands to start negotiating on the country’s future links with the bloc alongside the current talks on how to make the cleanest Brexit possible.  Officials said Tusk will be given the job of reconciling Macron’s vision of how the EU should embrace a joint budget, a shared military and harmonized taxes to stay globally relevant with those ideas of EU nations that might not want to grow too closer too quickly.  Tusk said he would seek “real solutions to real problems” and stressed the need to make progress “step-by-step, issue-by-issue.”  Macron said the EU had to seize the moment of having an improved economy and increased confidence in the bloc to push through reforms before European elections in 2019.  “2018 is a year of opportunity for Europeans,” he said. “In 5 or 10 years, it will be too late.”  Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte warned, however, not to set the bar too high, since changes in the bloc of half a billion people have always been tough to achieve.  “Under-promise and over-deliver,” Rutte said. “Don’t promise an elephant and see a mouse show up.”  The collegial atmosphere was bolstered by a non-confrontational dinner Thursday night for EU leaders, where few of the usual east-west or north-south fissures spoiled the mood, officials said.  The goodwill has not extended to the issue of Brexit over the past months.  EU leaders at their Oct. 19-20 summit have to say whether “sufficient progress” has been achieved on divorce issues with Britain — citizens’ rights, the Irish border and a financial settlement — to grant the U.K. its wish to start talking about a new trade deal with the EU.  Juncker said it will take “a miracle” for there to be sufficient progress by then, despite a round of negotiations in Brussels this week that ended with some progress.  Other EU leaders sounded a similar tone. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said despite “a better vibe and a better mood coming out of the negotiations” he questioned whether the time was right to move on to trade issues with Britain.  “It’s still very evident that there’s more work to be done,” he said.  For the past week, though, British Prime Minister Theresa May has sounded more conciliatory. In Estonia, she guaranteed her country’s commitment to security even though the nation is leaving the bloc.

Chipmaker Nvidia and business software maker Oracle both rose. (AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews, File)  NEW YORK (AP) — Large technology and health care companies and smaller U.S.-focused firms rose again Friday as stocks finished the third quarter at record highs.  Stocks were mixed at the start of trading, as they had been the day before. But chipmakers and big-name technology companies pulled stocks higher, as they have done all year. Health care companies also did better than the rest of the market. Tyson Foods climbed after it gave strong profit forecasts, and investors cheered strong quarterly results from homebuilder KB Home.  The market ended the quarter on a four-day winning streak that began after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said the central bank plans to continue to raising interest rates.  “It’s all about the confidence they have that despite low inflation, it still makes sense to raise interest rates,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. “She’s confident in the economy and the economic backdrop is very solid.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 9.30 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,519.36. The Dow Jones industrial average turned higher to finish with a gain of 23.89 points, or 0.1 percent, at 22,405.09. The Nasdaq composite jumped 42.51 points, or 0.7 percent, to 6,495.96. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both closed at all-time highs.  The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks added 2.08 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,490.86. It’s also at record highs after a big rally this month. It climbed 6 percent in September as investors felt positive about the U.S. economy and hoped Congress and President Donald Trump’s administration will reduce taxes.  Tyson Foods jumped after the food company raised its annual guidance and said profits for its beef business were better than expected. Thanks in part to cost cuts, Tyson also forecast a bigger profit than analysts expected for next year.  Tyson climbed $5, or 7.6 percent, to $70.45. The stock gained more ground Friday than it had for the rest of this year put together. Rival Hormel Foods, whose brands include Skippy, rose 43 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $32.14. Those companies and their competitors have struggled in recent years as Americans look for fresher food options.  Technology companies rose further and were the best-performing S&P 500 sector in the third quarter. They also held that distinction in the first quarter. The S&P 500 technology index has climbed 26 percent in 2017, while the S&P 500 is up 12.5 percent.  Facebook added $2.14, or 1.3 percent, to $170.87 and chip equipment maker Applied Materials rose $1.47, or 2.9 percent, to $52.09. Chipmaker Nvidia advanced $3.09, or 1.8 percent, to $178.77.  The recent gains for tech companies have come in spite of a slump for Apple, the world’s most valuable publicly-traded company. While Apple has soared this year, it’s down 4 percent since it announced its new line of iPhones and other products Sept. 12.  KB Home advanced after its third-quarter profit and sales beat estimates. The stock rose $1.90, or 8.6 percent, to $24.12. Other homebuilders also rose. Meritage Homes picked up 85 cents, or 2 percent, to $44.40 and D.R. Horton advanced 95 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $39.93.  Oil prices recovered and turned higher just before the close of trading. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 11 cents to $51.67 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, rose 13 cents to $57.54 a barrel in London.  U.S. crude oil rose 12 percent in the third quarter, which helped energy companies do better than the rest of the market. But on Friday those companies gave back some of their recent gains.  Stocks have risen for eight quarters in a row, and Frederick, of the Schwab Center, said he expects that to continue in the fourth quarter as the global economy is likely to keep growing and interest rates in the U.S. should rise more, which will help profits for banks. However Frederick said it’s possible that concerns about domestic politics, including the federal debt limit, or international concerns such as tensions with North Korea will weigh on stocks again, as they did at times in the third quarter.  In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline slid 3 cents to $1.61 a gallon. Heating oil declined 2 cents to $1.81 a gallon. Natural gas gave up 1 cent to $3.01 per 1,000 cubic feet.  Bond prices turned lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.33 percent from 2.31 percent.  Gold lost $3.90 to $1,284.80 an ounce. Silver slid 17 cents to $16.68 an ounce. Copper fell 3 cents to $2.96 a pound.  The dollar rose to 112.51 yen from 112.39 yen. The euro rose to $1.1816 from $1.1791.  Germany’s DAX added 1 percent and the FTSE 100 in Britain and CAC 40 in France both gained 0.7 percent. In Japan, the benchmark Nikkei 225 inched down less than 0.1 percent.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)  WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Friday that the centerpiece of his plan to help American businesses and workers “thrive, compete and grow” is a “giant, beautiful, massive, the biggest ever in our country, tax cut.”  Trump and congressional Republicans unveiled the broad outlines of the tax plan earlier this week.  “My administration is working every day to lift the burden on companies and workers so you can thrive, compete and grow,” Trump said in a speech to the National Association of Manufacturers. He said the tax cut plan was a core element.  The nearly $6 trillion plan sketched out this week by Trump and other officials would deeply reduce taxes for corporations, simplify tax brackets and nearly double the standard deduction used by most tax filers. But many details remain to be fleshed out.  In the remarks, Trump highlighted a provision of the plan that would allow businesses for the next five years to write off the full cost of new equipment in the year it’s purchased. Trump said that proposal alone will encourage companies to invest and create jobs.  Under the broader proposal, corporations would see their top tax rate cut from 35 percent to 20 percent. Seven personal tax brackets would be reduced to three: 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. But the information released didn’t include the income levels applied to the rates, making it difficult to know how a typical family’s tax bill may be affected.  President Donald Trump's economic adviser is pushing back against the suggestion that the administration's tax plan could benefit the wealthy. (Sept. 28)  Trump said a 20 percent corporate tax rate will be the lowest top marginal income tax rate for small- and medium-sized businesses in more than 80 years. “It will be rocket fuel for our economy,” he said.  The Republican tax plan also recommends a surcharge for the very wealthy. The standard deduction would nearly double to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for families, basically increasing the amount of personal income that would not be taxed. Deductions for mortgage interest and charitable giving would remain, but the plan seeks to end most other itemized deductions.  Meanwhile, Senate Republicans unveiled a budget plan Friday that lays the groundwork for overhauling the tax code. The House and Senate must pass the blueprint before lawmakers can tackle the still-developing tax bill.  The Senate Budget Committee release comes before a committee vote next week. A companion House measure is headed for a floor vote next week, too.  In the address, Trump also reviewed policy changes since he took office in January that he said are intended to improve the business climate, including lifting restrictions on energy production, reversing environmental rules and rolling back regulations.  He also highlighted economic gains of the past eight months.  Jay Timmons, president and CEO of the association, said Trump is a leader “who has made manufacturing the engine of our country.”  Trump wants to sign tax legislation into law by the end of the year.  ___  Follow Darlene Superville on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dsupervilleap",4.125,12,"[4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 2.0, 4.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.0, 3.0]"

Dubai is hoping to one day have flying, pilotless taxis darting among its skyscrapers. Just this week, the city-state in the United Arab Emirates hosted crews from the German company Volocopter, which had an electric, battery-powered two-seat prototype take off and land. Dubai hopes to have rules in place in the next five years to be ready for having the aircraft regularly flying through its skies. (AP Photo/Kamran Jebreili)  DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — With a whirling buzz from 18 rotors, the pilotless helicopter gently lifted off the ground and soared up into the afternoon sky, the spire of the world’s tallest building visible behind it.  The recent unmanned flight by the German-made electric Volocopter represents the latest step in Dubai’s pursuit of flying taxis, which would not seem out of place among the Gulf city’s already futuristic skyline — imagine “Blade Runner,” with less rain.  Dubai already has invested in another model of a flying, autonomous taxi, and is working to design regulations for their use. Putting more passengers in the air could free its already clogged highways and burnish the city’s cutting-edge image of itself.  “It’s public transportation for everybody, so you can use, you can order it, you can pay for the trip and the trip is not much more expensive than with a car,” said Alexander Zosel, Volocopter’s co-founder. “If you build roads, you build bridges, it’s a huge amount and it’s always much more cheaper to have a system where you don’t need that infrastructure.”  Driving in Dubai already makes one yearn for the open skies. Rush hour on Sheikh Zayed Road, a dozen-lane artery running down the length of the city, alternates between dense gridlock and sports-car slalom. Over 1.5 million Dubai-registered vehicles ply its roads, not counting those crowding in from the United Arab Emirates’ six other sheikhdoms.  The Volocopter’s designers envision the electric, battery-powered two-seat helicopters taking off and landing from pads set up across the city. The prototype used in Dubai has a maximum flying time of 30 minutes at 50 kph (31 mph), with a maximum airspeed of 100 kph (62 mph). Batteries charged in climate-controlled areas near the pads would be swapped in as needed.  “I believe (the) urban air taxi will contribute an interesting addition to the existing transportation modes,” Volocopter CEO Florian Reuter said. “There are certain routes that are just extremely beneficial if you can go to the third dimension.”  In practice, however, there’s a long way to go. Convincing white-knuckled flyers to get into a buzzing, pilotless helicopter is just the beginning. Unpiloted passenger flights represent a new frontier for regulators. Dubai’s Road and Transportation Authority, which has invested an undisclosed sum in Volocopter, says it will work the next five years to come up with laws and develop safety procedures.  That’s a longer time frame than initially offered by Dubai. Mattar al-Tayer, the head of the RTA, told a conference in February that the Chinese-made EHang 184, a Volocopter competitor, would be regularly flying through the city’s skies by July, though that deadline came and went. The RTA did not respond to a request for comment.  Still, Dubai remains at the front of the pack when it comes to embracing new technology.  Dubai’s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, says he wants 25 percent of all passenger trips in the city to be done by driverless vehicles by 2030. The city has a deal in place with Los Angeles-based Hyperloop One to study the potential for building a hyperloop line between it and Abu Dhabi, the Emirati capital. That technology has levitating pods powered by electricity and magnetism hurtle through low-friction pipes at a top speed of 1,220 kph (760 mph).  For now, the Volocopter’s brief flights in Dubai drew VIP crowds and film crews making advertisements. But its executives say after rules are in place, they will be ready for mass production. Already, Volocopter has drawn the interest of automobile manufacturer Daimler AG, which was part of a consortium that put up $30 million in capital for Volocopter. Even Airbus, a major airplane manufacturer, is looking at building its own flying taxis.  “We’ve proven that it works,” Zosel said. “At the end of this five years, Dubai will be ready.”  ___  Online:  Volocopter: https://www.volocopter.com/en/  Dubai’s Road and Transportation Authority: https://www.rta.ae  ___  Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellap.

Spanish riot police have smashed their way into polling stations to try to halt a disputed independence referendum and fired rubber bullets at protesters. (AP Photo/Emilio Morenatti)  BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Catalonia’s regional government declared a landslide win for the “yes” side in a disputed referendum on independence from Spain that degenerated into mayhem Sunday, with more than 800 people injured as riot police attacked peaceful protesters and unarmed civilians trying to cast their ballots.  Catalonia has “won the right to become an independent state,” Catalan president Carles Puigdemont said after the polls closed, adding that he would keep his pledge to declare independence unilaterally if the “yes” side wins.  “Today the Spanish state wrote another shameful page in its history with Catalonia,” Puigdemont added, saying he would appeal to the European Union to look into alleged human rights violations during the vote.  Catalan regional government spokesman Jordi Turull told reporters early Monday that 90 percent of the 2.26 million Catalans who voted chose the “yes” side in favor of independence. He said nearly 8 percent of voters rejected independence and the rest of the ballots were blank or void. He said 15,000 votes were still being counted.  The region has 5.3 million registered voters, and Turull said the number of ballots didn’t include those confiscated by Spanish police during violent raids that aimed to stop the vote.  Spanish riot police attacked peaceful protesters in Catalonia on Sunday to try to disrupt a banned independence vote, injuring more than 700 people as Spain's constitutional crisis deepened. (Oct. 1)  No one knows what will happen if Catalan officials follow through on their pledge to use the vote as a basis for declaring independence, a provocation that would possible remove from Spain one of its most prosperous regions, including the coastal city of Barcelona, the regional capital.  Hundreds of police armed with truncheons and rubber bullets were sent in from other regions to confiscate ballots and stop the voting, and amateur video showed some officers dragging people out of polling stations by the hair, throwing some down stairs, kicking them and pushing them to the ground. Anguished, frightened screams could be heard.  Police were acting on a judge’s orders to stop the referendum, which the Spanish government had declared illegal and unconstitutional — and Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said going forward with the vote only served to sow divisions.  In a televised address after the majority of polls closed Sunday, he thanked the Spanish police, saying they had acted with “firmness and serenity” — comments sure to anger Catalans.  Spanish Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis said the violence, while “unfortunate” and “unpleasant” was “proportionate.”  “If people insist in disregarding the law and doing something that has been consistently declared illegal and unconstitutional, law enforcement officers need to uphold the law,” Dastis told The Associated Press in an interview.  Catalans favoring a break with Spain have long wanted more than the limited autonomy they now have, arguing that they contribute far more than they receive from the central government, which controls key areas including taxes and infrastructure. The police aggression on Sunday was likely to only fuel the passion for independence, and the main separatist group urged the regional government to declare independence after the violent crackdown.  By day’s end, Catalan health services said 844 civilians had been treated in hospitals for injuries, including two in serious condition and another person who was being treated for an eye injury that fit the profile of having been hit by a rubber bullet. Thirty-three police officers were also injured.  At the Pau Claris School in Barcelona, amateur footage filmed by one voter showed police roughing up unarmed people standing in their way. Amateur video from other locations showed similar tactics, with people seen being hit, kicked and thrown around by police, including elderly people with their dogs, young girls and regular citizens of all stripes. Many tried to shield themselves from being smacked on the head.  There were also some signs of provocation by activists. In footage released by the Spanish Interior Ministry, some protesters were seen throwing objects and metal barriers at riot police.  Elisa Arouca, who was waiting to vote outside the Estel school in central Barcelona, reacted with anger when national police agents yanked her and other prospective voters out of the way, then smashed open the door and confiscated the ballot boxes.  She had been planning to vote in favor of keeping Catalonia part of Spain, but decided instead to join the march for independence. She moved to another polling station to try and cast her vote in favor of breaking away.  “I was always against independence, but what the Spanish state is doing is making me change my mind,” she said. “The national police and civil guard are treating us like criminals.”  There was no organized campaign for the “no” side in the vote, which most national political parties boycotted because it lacked legal guarantees and was suspended by the courts. Polls in recent years have shown roughly half of the 7.5 million residents of the region want to remain a part of Spain.  Mari Martinez, a 43-year-old waitress, said she didn’t vote. “I don’t lean toward independence, because we are part of Spain,” she said. “Today’s violence is not good for anybody. We never should have gotten to this point. Politicians haven’t done their job, and they should have reached an agreement a long time ago.”  A member of the Israeli parliament, sent to observe the vote, said she was shocked by the use of rubber bullets by Spanish police against crowds of unarmed voters.  “We did expect a normal democratic process,” said Ksenia Svetlova, part of a delegation of 33 observers invited by Catalan officials. “We knew that a lot of police were here but still, you know, there should be a respect for the will of the people to vote regardless of what you think of the referendum.”  Tensions were running so high that Barcelona played its soccer game against Las Palmas without fans after the team announced the match would be played behind closed doors shortly before kickoff, with thousands of soccer fans already outside the stadium. Barcelona wanted to postpone the game but said the Spanish league refused the request.  Manuel Condeminas, a 48-year-old IT manager who tried to block police from driving away with ballot boxes on Sunday, said police had kicked him and others before using their batons and firing the rubber bullets.  Elsewhere, civil guard officers, wearing helmets and carrying shields, used a hammer to break the glass of the front door and a lock cutter to break into the Sant Julia de Ramis sports center near the city of Girona that was being used as a polling station. A woman injured outside the building was wheeled away on a stretcher by paramedics.  Clashes broke out less than an hour after polls opened, and not long before Puigdemont, the Catalan regional president, was expected to turn up to vote at the sports center. Polling station workers reacted peacefully and broke out into songs and chants challenging the officers’ presence. Puigdemont was forced to vote in Cornella de Terri, near the northern city of Girona, his spokesman said.  ___  Associated Press writer Alex Oller contributed to this report from Barcelona, and Gregory Katz and Frank Griffiths contributed from London.",3.2857142857142856,14,"[3.5, 4.0, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.0, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5, 5.0, 4.5, 1.5, 2.5]"

Playboy had millions of readers at its peak in the 1970s and a wide-ranging influence on sexual mores and popular culture. Today the magazine is a bit part in the Playboy empire, which is reaping the rewards of its famous bunny logo. (AP Photo/Kin Cheung, File)  NEW YORK (AP) — Playboy Enterprises has outlived the founder of its iconic magazine, though largely as a shadow of its former self.  Hugh Hefner’s Playboy, a magazine founded to celebrate his “Playboy Philosophy” of sexual freedom, influenced sexual mores and popular culture for decades. A business empire grew out of that, but it’s shrunk considerably over the years. It now lives on primarily as a set of bunny ears slapped on products around the world.  Hefner died earlier this week at 91.  The magazine itself, whose circulation peaked in the 1970s at 7 million, is now seen as more of a marketing tool that supports the licensing operations at the heart of the modern company.  “The magazine is sort of the tiny part of the equation now,” said Samir Husni, director of the Magazine Innovation Center at the University of Mississippi.  PLAYBOY THE MAGAZINE  Playboy, born in 1953, is still putting out print issues. But today its circulation has fallen below 500,000, according to industry tracker the Alliance for Audited Media.  The free-for-all of internet publishing that has squeezed the newspaper and magazine industries has done likewise for Hefner’s brainchild. Pornography for just about any taste or flavor is now available for free online.  For those who read Playboy for the articles ... well, there’s no shortage of compelling journalism spread across the internet and available in your Facebook newsfeed.  THE PRIVATE EQUITY ERA  In 2011, as Hefner and private equity firm Rizvi Traverse Management arranged to take Playboy private, then-CEO Scott Flanders highlighted its transition to a “brand management company.” Playboy aimed more upscale, dropping licensing deals that were more low-market in the U.S. It sold its adult TV and digital operations to an internet porn company. Then in October 2015 it declared that the magazine would no longer publish the nude photos it was famous for.  Media reports from spring 2016 said that Playboy was looking to sell itself for $500 million, more than double the price paid in 2011. Private equity firms typically acquire troubled companies, then try to slash costs, improve profitability and resell them for a higher price.  Playboy didn’t end up selling itself, but made a string of changes anyway. Flanders left, and the CEO now is Ben Kohn, a managing partner at Rizvi Traverse, Playboy’s majority owner.  Hefner’s son Cooper, then 24, was brought in as chief creative officer in July 2016. Then the company sold the Playboy Mansion for $100 million to next-door neighbor Daren Metropoulos, owner of Hostess (maker of Twinkies, Ho Hos and Ding Dongs).  The magazine reversed itself on its no-nudes policy earlier this year , saying nudity was part of its identity.  LICENSING EMPIRE  Playboy Enterprises today pulls in most of its revenue from licensing its brand — its name and those instantly recognizable bunny ears in a bow tie — for everything from perfume bottles to men’s shoes. It wants to once again conjure up a hip and sexy image, leaving behind the cheese factor that’s become associated with it in the U.S. The biggest market is Asia, and Playboy says it has been particularly successful in China.  “Playboy isn’t just the magazine — the brand has evolved to become a ‘lifestyle’ brand with a luxurious, smart, and cultured image,” Karina Masolova, executive editor of the trade publication The Licensing Letter, said in an email. “The branded merchandise is always going to sell (at least decently well) in the mature American and European markets.”  Masolova added that while the Playboy brand’s growth may be tapped out in the U.S. and western Europe, Asia is a bright spot where Playboy is cultivating a premium image in men’s fashion.  The magazine also has an international presence with 25 foreign editions, with Germany the largest, and owns a subscription adult-entertainment channel, Playboy TV, available in more than 60 countries. A string of Playboy Clubs still dot the world; one is even opening in New York later this year , complete with Bunnies, more than three decades after the original New York club closed.  Still, as a private company, Playboy’s finances are opaque. In its last year as a publicly traded company, revenue fell 10.5 percent to $215 million in 2010, and it had posted three years of annual losses. Its finances then point toward Playboy’s direction today: licensing fees weren’t the biggest revenue source, but they accounted for nearly all the profit.  Some think it is too late for a Playboy resurgence, and say the brand will never approach the prominence and influence it once had. “The times have passed Playboy,” Husni said. “Without a customer base, without consumers, there is no magazine. With no magazine, there’s no brand.”",3.8333333333333335,12,"[5.0, 5.0, 2.5, 4.0, 5.0, 4.5, 2.5, 4.5, 1.5, 5.0, 5.0, 1.5]"

Jordi Sanchez, leader of secessionist group ANC, tells a large crowd in Barcelona’s main square he hopes that “very soon we will see the birth of a new Catalan state.”  Sanchez warns local leaders “Now, don’t let us down ...The moment of truth has arrived.”  Catalan President Carles Puigdemont had vowed to declare independence with 48 hours if the “Yes” side wins Sunday’s disputed vote. But there was no campaign for the “No” side before the vote was suspended by Spain’s Constitutional Court.  Authorities say 844 people and 33 police were injured Sunday in Spanish police raids to halt the vote.  ___  10:15 p.m.  Spain’s main opposition leader says the vote held Sunday in Catalonia “has perverted the concept of democracy” and urged central authorities to begin negotiations with the regional Catalan leaders.  The Socialists’ general secretary Pedro Sanchez blamed the “serious institutional crisis” on both the national government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and the regional Catalan government of Carles Puigdemont.  He condemned Rajoy’s cabinet for ordering the police charges against voters to halt the suspended referendum, but said he would stand by Rajoy, his political rival, in order to support the stability of Spain in a moment of deep crisis.  Sanchez said the vote “consecrates the Catalan government’s flight forward, creating solely division and not providing any solution.”  ___  10:15 p.m.  Spain’s Interior Ministry says 33 police officers were hurt when they carried out raids to try to stop an independence referendum in the northeastern region of Catalonia.  The Ministry says 19 members of the National Police and 14 Civil Guard were hurt when police smashed their way into polling stations on Sunday. Catalan health services say 761 people were injured, two seriously, by police who used batons and rubber bullets against voters.  Police closed 319 polling stations out of some 2,300, according to Catalan authorities.  Spain’s Constitutional court had suspended the vote but separatist leaders in Catalonia went ahead with the vote anyway.  ___  10 p.m.  Judges in Spain’s region of Catalonia will investigate the Catalan regional police for allegedly disobeying court orders to stop Sunday’s referendum on independence.  The highest court in the region says six different courts have said they will investigate different cases of the regional police not acting to stop the vote that had been suspended by Spain’s Constitutional Court.  Agents from Spain’s two national police forces, the Civil Guard and the National Police, carried out raids to confiscate ballot boxes and close some polling stations. Authorities say 761 people and 11 police were hurt Sunday in those police raids.  The Catalan police were seen limiting their participation to warning voters that they needed to leave the school polling stations that they were occupying overnight.  ___  9 p.m.  Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy insists there has been no independence vote in Catalonia.  In a television address after polls closed Sunday in the northeastern region, Rajoy said the great majority of Catalans did not “follow the script of the secessionists.” He gave no proof for that statement.  Rajoy said the independence referendum only served to sow divisions. He thanked the Spanish police, saying they acted with “firmness and serenity” in response to the referendum.  Catalonia’s health services, however, say 761 people were injured by police on Sunday, with two of them in serious condition.  Spanish riot police smashed their way into polling stations across Catalonia to try and stop Sunday’s referendum, sometimes beating voters. Spain’s top court had suspended the vote but local authorities went ahead anyway.  ___  8:45 p.m.  Catalonia’s health services have increased the number of people injured by police during Sunday’s disputed referendum to 761 people who were treated at hospitals.

At one voting station in Barcelona, in the Joan Miro school, applause broke out Sunday night after 8 p.m. as it was announced that voting had ended. Volunteers opened the plastic ballot boxes, turned them over and started sorting the ballots. The “yes” pile was many times bigger than the “no” pile.  Joan Maria Pique, spokesman for Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, says that polling stations are closing except at those where people are still waiting to vote.  ___  8:15 p.m.  Spain’s foreign minister says the violence seen Sunday as police tried to prevent people from voting in Catalonia in a banned independence referendum was “unfortunate” and “unpleasant” but “proportionate.”  In an interview with The Associate Press, Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis blamed the violence exclusively on Catalan President Carles Puigdemont and his regional government.  Dastis says “if people insist in disregarding the law and doing something that has been consistently declared illegal and unconstitutional, law enforcement officers need to uphold the law.”  Officials say at least 465 people and 11 police were injured Sunday. Videos showed police roughing up voters, who tried to shield themselves from blows.  Dastis says, however, “it was a proportionate use of force, there was no excessive violence and it was a reaction to the situation they were faced with when they were prevented from doing their job.”  ___  7:55 p.m.  Barcelona’s mayor is calling on Spain’s conservative Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to resign after Spanish riot police were seen beating and kicking people in their efforts to shut down a vote on independence for the northeastern region of Catalonia.  Mayor Ada Colau told TV3 that “Rajoy has been a coward, hiding behind the prosecutors and courts. Today he crossed all the red lines with the police actions against normal people, old people, families who were defending their fundamental rights.”  She adds that “It seems obvious to me that Mariano Rajoy should resign.”  Colau also says, after the violence Sunday, Catalonia has “earned the right to demand” a proper vote on independence from Spain. She says “the European Union must take a stand on what has happened in Catalonia.”  Officials say at least 465 people and 11 police were injured Sunday.  ___  7:25 p.m.  Catalonia’s pro-independence regional government says Spain is “the shame of Europe” for the way it has cracked down on the region’s bid to hold a secession referendum  Government spokesman Jordi Turull says “what the police are doing is simply savage, it’s an international scandal.”  The Catalan government’s health service says 465 people have been treated in hospitals following clashes Sunday with police who were ordered by a regional judge to prevent the independence referendum from taking place. Turull said two of the injured were in serious condition.  He said “Today, Spain is the shame of Europe.”  Turull said that despite police actions “the trend we are seeing is that millions have voted,” adding that a recount of votes would take some time. He said police had closed 319 polling stations out of some 2,300.  ___  7:15 p.m.  On the streets of Madrid there are mixed reactions to the Spanish government’s crackdown on the independence referendum in Catalonia, where police were seen beating and kicking voters as they confiscated ballots.  Francisco Lopez, 53, said the authorities’ use of force to stop the voting was justified. He says “when there is an unlawful act, the security forces are there to prevent this unlawful act.”  Jose Daniel Rodríguez, a 67-year-old university teacher, disagreed, saying the Spanish government should have let the vote go ahead. He says “in a democratic society, everyone has the right to express themselves.”  Others called for both sides to resolve the situation through negotiations, not police operations.  Ignacio Osorio, 51, says “I believe that from today we have to sit and talk, without conditions.”  ___  6:15 p.m.  An amateur video filmed by a voter in Barcelona shows Spanish police kicking, beating and pulling people by the hair in clashes that took place as they tried to stop a referendum on independence in the northeastern region of Catalonia.  The video, acquired by the Associated Press, show National Police officers pulling and pushing people down a stairway at the Pau Claris School in the Sant Marti neighborhood Sunday. At one point, it shows an officer jumping down the steps and apparently stomping on a person on the floor.  One person can be seen being pulled by the hair and others kicked on the ground. People can be heard screaming wildly and shouting “Out!” at the officers.  The person that filmed the video said voters were simply sitting and trying to slow the police operation down. She said she saw no provocations. She asked for her name not to be published.  __ Iain Sullivan.  ___  5:15 p.m.  Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau says more than 460 people have been injured in Catalonia in clashes with Spanish police who trying to prevent a referendum on independence from taking place in the northeastern region.  Colau said Sunday that as mayor of the city, she demands “an immediate end to police charges against the defenseless population.”  Police have baton-charged and fired rubber bullets to disperse crowds in Barcelona and other towns and cities. Videos have showed them beating people repeatedly as they try to confiscate ballots and ballot boxes.  In addition to the protesters and voters injured, Spain’s Interior Ministry says 11 police officers have been injured fulfilling judicial orders to prevent the referendum on independence.  ___  5 p.m.  Barcelona’s soccer game against Las Palmas has gone ahead without fans in attendance at the Camp Nou stadium amid the disputed referendum on Catalonia’s independence.  Barcelona made the announcement that the match would be played behind closed doors with less than a half hour to kickoff, with thousands of soccer fans already waiting outside the stadium.  Barcelona wanted the game to be postponed, but it said that the Spanish league refused to accept its request.  ___  4:50 p.m.  Scotland’s leader has appealed to Spain to “change course,” amid violence shown in television images in Catalonia following the disputed independence referendum.  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Sunday on her Twitter feed that she was increasingly concerned by the images, which have shown police smashing into polling stations and roughing up voters. Police also fired rubber bullets. Hundreds of people were injured, including 11 police officers.  Sturgeon says that “regardless of views on independence, we should all condemn the scenes being witnessed.”  Sturgeon called on Spain “to change course before someone is seriously hurt. Let people vote peacefully.”  The vote is of particular interest in Scotland, which held its own referendum on independence in 2014. The vote, which ended with a vote to remain in the United Kingdom, featured heated debate but was peaceful.  ___  4:30 p.m.  Spain’s interior Ministry says police have closed 79 of about 2,300 polling stations that the Catalan government has authorized to stage its referendum on independence in northeastern Catalonia.  The ministry said Sunday that police, who are under orders to prevent the referendum from taking place, arrested three people, one a minor, for disobedience and assaulting officers.  It said 34 of the voting centers closed were in the Catalan capital of Barcelona. A regional court last week ordered police to close all the polling stations.  Earlier Sunday, Catalan government spokesman Jordi Turull said that voting was underway in 96 percent of the voting centers.  The Spanish government says no referendum has taken place.  The ministry said 11 police officers were slightly injured in disturbances. Catalan officials say 337 people have been injured, some seriously, in clashes with police.  ___  4:15 p.m.  Belgium’s prime minister has called for political dialogue in Spain amid a police crackdown on voting during the Catalonia independence referendum.  Charles Michel also condemned all forms of aggression, tweeting that “violence can never be the answer!”  Catalonia’s regional president, Carles Puigdemont, responded to the tweet, saying “thank you very much ... for you commitment against violence and for your call for political dialogue.”  Spanish police have fired rubber bullets at protesters outside a Barcelona polling station and smashed their way into at least two voting centers. Catalan officials say 337 people have been injured, including some seriously. Police say 11 officers have also been injured.  ___  3:10 p.m.  Spain’s Interior Ministry says 11 police officers have been injured fulfilling judicial orders to prevent the referendum on independence in northeastern Catalonia from taking place.  The ministry tweeted that the injured Sunday included nine National Police officers and two Civil Guard agents.  Police battled with pro-referendum supporters in the streets of Barcelona on Sunday, baton charging them and firing rubber bullets. Hundreds of people were reported injured.  The ministry posted a video on its Twitter account showing Civil Guard officers jumping into two police vehicles to flee a stone-throwing mob in the town of Sant Carles de la Rapita.  ___  2:55 p.m.  Catalonia’s government spokesman says 337 people have been injured, some seriously, during the police crackdown Sunday on a banned referendum on breaking away from Spain.  Jordi Turull said he couldn’t disclose more details about the wounded out of respect to their relatives.  Police fired rubber bullets near at least one Barcelona polling station, and have clashed with protesters throughout Catalonia.  The regional government’s spokesman, Jordi Turull, blamed the violence directly on Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido.  Turull said that actions by Spanish National Police and Civil Guard forces on Sunday were politically motivated and showed “a clear motivation to harm citizens.”  Catalan international affairs director, Raul Romeva, said that regional authorities would appeal to European authorities for Rajoy’s governments’ violations of human rights.  ___  2:30 p.m.  Spanish deputy prime minister says Spanish police have intervened with “firmness and proportionality” against the Catalan vote on secession.  Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said Sunday Spanish authorities acted in a professional and proportional way, and that they weren’t going after voters, but referendum material.  She accused the Catalan government that is trying to hold the referendum of behaving with absolute irresponsibility.  She said, “There hasn’t been a referendum or the semblance of one.”  ___  2:10 p.m.  Elisa Arouca was waiting to vote outside the Estel school in central Barcelona when National Police agents yanked her and other prospective voters out of the way, used a mace to smash the door open, and confiscated the ballot boxes.  The violence had an impact on her. She had been planning to vote in favor to keeping Catalonia part of Spain, but decided instead to join the push for independence. She moved to another polling station to try and cast her vote.  Arouca said that “I was always against independence but what the Spanish state is doing is making me change my mind. The National Police and Civil Guard are treating us like criminals. I was most likely going to vote “No” until the National Police sent me flying. Now I will try to vote Yes.”  She only made up her mind to vote Wednesday after the Spanish officials made a series of arrests designed to shut down the disputed voting process.  ___  2 p.m.  Barcelona’s mayor has called for Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to step down in the wake of the violent police response during a banned independence referendum in Catalonia.  Ada Colau says that “if this is a democracy, the police action should be stopped immediately so we can later have a dialogue, which is what is needed.”  The mayor was scheduled to vote at a secondary school, but wasn’t able to do it because police blocked access to the polling station.  Colau supports the vote as Catalan’s expression of their political will but says that it can’t be considered a binding referendum because it hasn’t been agreed by the state, as Spain’s Constitution requires.  She called Sunday’s scuffles and clashes between voters and police “a rupture” of Rajoy’s government, saying “Rajoy has to clearly step down because he has failed in his political responsibilities.”  ___  1:40 p.m.  A member of the Israeli Parliament observing Catalonia’s independence referendum says she was shocked by the use of rubber bullets by Spanish police against crowds of unarmed protesters.  Ksenia Svetlova said Sunday the bullets used “can squash somebody’s head.” She said she hadn’t expected to see such tactics used in Europe.  She said she saw people bleeding and injured on the scene.  Svetlova says that “we did expect a normal democratic process. We knew that a lot of police were here but still, you know, there should be a respect for the will of the people to vote regardless of what you think of the referendum.”  Svetlova says she was part of a delegation of about 30 people from other countries invited by Catalan regional officials to see the voting process.  ___  1:30 p.m.  Several hundred people have staged protests in central Madrid in favor of Spanish unity and against the pro-independence referendum authorities in northeastern Catalonia are trying to hold.  Some 300 people gathered Sunday in the city’s Plaza Mayor square, waving Spanish red and yellow flags and chanting slogans in favor of Spanish unity.  Half the crowd then moved to Madrid’s emblematic Sol square and staged a second rally in front of the regional government’s headquarters.  The protesters applauded police standing guard outside the building in a show of support for Spain’s security forces.  Spain has sent thousands of police reinforcements to northeastern Catalonia to try to prevent the referendum from taking place.  Protests for and against the Catalan secession referendum were to be held again in Madrid later Sunday.  Major anti-independence protests took place in cities across Spain, including Catalonia, on Saturday.  ___  1:20 p.m.  Catalonia’s ombudsman has said he will complain about the Spanish government’s tactics to European authorities including the European Council.  Rafael Ribo said Sunday the government forces had used disproportionate tactics in “violent actions against citizens” while trying to shut down the disputed independence referendum.  Ribo, an appointee by the regional parliament who leads the office overseeing citizens’ rights, said in an emotional appearance before reporters that the Spanish government has shown “little respect for human rights.”  He called on the government to stop all violent actions against citizens.  ___  12:45 p.m.  The Spanish government’s top official in Catalonia says that security forces are acting “professionally” to enforce a judicial decision to halt a banned referendum on the region’s secession from Spain.  Enric Millo, the central governments delegate in the northeastern region, has thanked the National Police and Civil Guard forces for their efforts to “oversee safety of all Catalans and for guaranteeing their rights.”  Millo said that “today’s events in Catalonia can never be portrayed as a referendum or anything similar.”  Spanish police have fired rubber bullets at protesters and smashed into polling stations to try to halt the voting.  A spokesman for Catalonia’s regional government has labelled the crackdown as “repression” and called for Millo to step down for the handling of the police response.  ___  12:30 p.m.  Catalonia’s regional leader has condemned the Spanish police crackdown on people trying to vote in the disputed independence referendum.  Catalan President Carles Puigdemont said that “police brutality will shame forever the Spanish state” after police smashed their way into voting centers and fired rubber bullets to disperse crowds.  Police have been ordered to prevent the vote from taking place.  Puigdemont was welcomed by cheering crowds at the gymnasium where police broke in to halt voting. The Catalan leader was meant to vote there in Sant Julia de Ramis but had to choose a different polling center instead.  He said the Spanish government had damaged itself by its actions.  Puigdemont said that “today, the Spanish state has lost much more than what it had already lost, while Catalonia has won.”  ___  11:30 a.m.  Catalonia’s government spokesman says that the disputed independence referendum is underway in 73 percent of about 6,000 polling stations despite a police crackdown to try to halt the vote and technological obstacles.  Jordi Turull called for Catalans to remain calm and patient but to defend “in a civic and peaceful manner” their right to vote after riot police blocked voting in some polling centers and confiscated ballot boxes amid clashes with protesting voters. Police have also fired rubber projectiles at protesters in Barcelona.  Turull said that “the world has seen the violence of the Spanish state,” calling actions by the police as “repression that is a reminder of the Franco era” in reference to Spain’s dictatorship from 1939-1975.  Turull said the Spanish government’s representative in Catalonia, Enric Millo, should resign over the handling of the crackdown.  ___  11:10 a.m.  Spanish riot police have fired rubber projectiles at protesters outside a Barcelona polling station during Catalonia’s disputed independence referendum. Several people have been wounded.  The officers fired the projectiles while trying to clear protesters who were trying to impede National Police cars from leaving after police confiscated ballot boxes from the voting center.  An AP photographer witnessed how several people had been injured during the scuffles outside Barcelona’s Rius i Taule school, where some voters had cast ballots before police arrived.  Manuel Conedeminas, a 48-year-old IT manager who tried to block police from driving away with the ballot boxes, said agents had kicked them before using their batons and firing the projectiles, which were ball-shaped.  ___  10:45 a.m.  Several members of the Catalan regional government cast their ballots in a banned referendum on independence from Spain that became messy as riot police moved Sunday to halt voting in several polling centers.  Catalan regional president Carles Puigdemont voted in Cornella de Terri, near the northern city of Girona, after police took over control of the original polling center where he was due to appear, his spokesman Joan Maria Pique told The Associated Press.  Puigdemont has spearheaded the separatist politicians’ push to go ahead with the vote, despite a Constitutional Court suspension and fierce opposition by central authorities.  Regional vice president Oriol Junqueras also found his designated polling station taken over by police and moved to a different location where he eventually voted, regional broadcaster TV3 said.  ___  10:25 a.m.  Electoral volunteers at polling centers in Catalonia’s disputed referendum say they are unable to access census data because the website that hosted it is down, while internet service has been cut in some of the stations.  Technicians are working to set up new domains for the website where electoral managers need to register polling data, said Jordi Sole, a 48-year-old historian who displayed an accreditation with the regional government’s logo and said that was at the Collaso high school in Barcelona to assist with the voting.  Guillem Castillo, an 18-year-old engineering student designated as an electoral official there, said technical problems halted the voting shortly after it opened.  Spanish media reported similar problems with internet in polling centers across Catalonia.  ___  10:10 a.m.  Spanish riot police have forcefully removed a few hundred would-be voters from a polling station at a school in Barcelona.  Daniel Riano was inside when the police pushed aside a large group gathered outside busted in the Estela school’s front door.  The 54-year-old Riano said that “we were waiting inside to vote when the National Police used force to enter, they used a mace to break in the glass door and they took everything.”  He said that “one policeman put me in a headlock to drag me out, while I was holding my wife’s hand. It was incredible. They didn’t give any warning.”  Ferran Miralles said a crowd scuffled with police outside as they formed a tight perimeter around the door. Miralles said “they were very aggressive. They pushed me out of the way.”  Elsewhere in Barcelona, police have detained several people outside the Treball voting center amid scuffles on the street. Officers dragged some of the protesters away and detained them.  ___  9:30 a.m.  Spanish riot police have smashed their way into a polling station in Catalonia where the regional leader was expected to show up to vote in the disputed independence referendum.  Civil Guard riot police with shields have used a hammer to smash the glass of the front door of the voting center and lock cutters to force their way in. Scuffles erupted outside between police and people waiting to vote at the polling center in Sant Julia de Ramis, near the Catalan city of Girona.  There were no immediate reports of injuries. Television footage showed police using batons to disperse the crowds gathered outside the local sports center.  Catalan president Carles Puigdemont was scheduled to vote in the Sant Julia de Ramis sports center at 9.30 a.m. (0730 GMT; 3:30 a.m. EDT).  Puigdemont has spearheaded the separatist politicians’ push to go ahead with the vote, despite a Constitutional Court suspension and fierce opposition by central authorities.  ___  9 a.m.  Polling has begun in a banned referendum on Catalonia’s independence, with the first voters casting ballots amid cheers in some of the designated polling stations.  Parents, children and activist volunteers had occupied some of the 2,315 schools and other facilities to avoid closure from police acting on court orders.  Spain’s Constitutional Court ordered the vote to be suspended and central authorities say it’s illegal. Regional separatist leaders have pledged to hold it anyway, promising to declare independence if the “yes” side wins, and have called on 5.3 million eligible voters to cast ballots.  ___  8:30 a.m.  Catalan officials say that voters will be allowed to cast ballots at any polling station, rather than a designated one as previously announced, as many locations have been sealed off by police.  Regional government spokesman Jordi Turull says the last-minute system will allow the 5.3 million eligible voters to cast a ballot and avoid repeated votes.  Turull says that Catalans will be able to vote with ballots printed at home if needed, announcing that authorities had printed new ones after 5 million paper ballots were confiscated by police. He also said that a group of “academics and professionals” would serve as election observers.  The electoral board appointed by the regional parliament was disbanded last week to avoid hefty fines by Spain’s Constitutional Court.  ___  8:10 a.m.  Ballot boxes began arriving at some polling stations for a disputed referendum on Catalonia’s split from Spain that is being met with fierce opposition from Spanish authorities.  Police acting on court orders have been trying to confiscate ballot boxes for weeks as the crackdown to halt the vote intensified.  On Friday, officials unveiled a prototype of the plastic ballot boxes with a logo of the regional government.  Spain’s Constitutional Court ordered the vote to be suspended and central authorities say it’s illegal. Hopeful voters have been occupying out some of the designated voting stations to avoid police taking control and closing them off.  ___  6.25 a.m.  Some of the Catalans who are defying court orders to vote in a disputed referendum on their region’s secession from Spain say they want to send a strong message of displeasure with central authorities.  Activist Augsti Gil says there were no ballots or ballot boxes in Barcelona’s Joan Fuster high school where more than a hundred people have joined another hundred who spent the night occupying the designated polling station.  Gil says they expect materials to arrive Sunday morning ahead of the 9 a.m. opening of polls.  Joaquim Bosch, a 73 year-old retiree at Princep de Viana high school, where a crowd of 20 people was growing says he is uneasy about a possible police response to the crowds.  Bosch says: “I have come to vote to defend the rights of my country, which is Catalonia.”",3.2857142857142856,14,"[2.5, 3.0, 2.5, 3.0, 2.5, 4.5, 5.0, 2.5, 5.0, 1.5, 4.0, 5.0, 2.5, 2.5]"

Social media giant Facebook is expected to provide Congress on Monday, Oct. 2, 2017, with more than 3,000 ads that ran around the time of the 2016 presidential election and are linked to a Russian ad agency. (AP Photo/Ben Margot, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Social media giant Facebook is expected to provide Congress on Monday with more than 3,000 ads that ran around the time of the 2016 presidential election and are linked to a Russian ad agency.  Company officials will meet with the House and Senate intelligence committees and the Senate Judiciary Committee to hand over the ads, a Facebook official said. The official requested anonymity because the meetings are private.  Facebook said last month that that it had found thousands of ads linked to Facebook accounts that likely operated out of Russia and pushed divisive social and political issues during the U.S. presidential election. The company said it found 450 accounts and about $100,000 was spent on the ads.  Twitter has said it found postings linked to those same accounts, and the House and Senate intelligence panels have asked both companies, along with Google, to testify publicly in the coming weeks.  None of the companies have said whether they will accept the invitations.  The three committees are investigating Russian meddling in the election and whether there are any links to President Donald Trump’s campaign. They have recently focused on the spread of false news stories and propaganda on social media, putting pressure on the companies to turn over more information and release any Russia-linked ads.  It is unclear whether the ads will eventually be released publicly. Several lawmakers — including Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence panel — have said they believe the American public should see them.  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Sept. 21 that the company would provide the ads to Congress and also make changes to ensure the political ads on its platform are more transparent. The company is also working with Special Counsel Bob Mueller’s investigation into the Russian meddling at the Justice Department.  “As a general rule, we are limited in what we can discuss publicly about law enforcement investigations, so we may not always be able to share our findings publicly,” Zuckerberg said. “But we support Congress in deciding how to best use this information to inform the public, and we expect the government to publish its findings when their investigation is complete.”  Facebook said the ads addressed social and political issues and ran in the United States between 2015 and 2017. The company said the ads appear to have come from accounts associated with a Russian entity called the Internet Research Agency.  Twitter said last week that it had suspended 22 accounts corresponding to the 450 Facebook accounts that were likely operated out of Russia.  Warner criticized Twitter for not sharing more information with Congress, saying the company’s findings were merely “derivative” of Facebook’s work. The company’s presentations to staff last week “showed an enormous lack of understanding from the Twitter team of how serious this issue is, the threat it poses to democratic institutions.”",3.607142857142857,14,"[4.5, 5.0, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 2.0, 4.5, 4.0, 0.5, 5.0, 4.5, 5.0, 4.0, 2.0]"

Legal sports betting could be offered in 32 states within five years if the U.S. Supreme Court rules in favor of New Jersey's quest to offer such gambling, according to a new report. Major professional and collegiate sports leagues oppose New Jersey's effort to legalize sports betting, saying it would threaten the perceived integrity of the games. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File)  ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) — Legal sports betting could be offered in 32 states within five years if the U.S. Supreme Court rules in favor of New Jersey’s quest to offer such gambling, according to a new report.  Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, LLC, which tracks state-by-state gambling legislation, says a new market would be worth more than $6 billion. If all 50 states got on board, legal sports betting could be worth $7.1 to $15.8 billion, they estimate.  Americans are already betting up to $60 billion annually using offshore sites and bookies, said Chris Grove, managing director for the firm. It’s an industry that generates some $3 billion in revenue each year from U.S. customers.  “We estimate that a properly regulated market could be worth nearly five times that amount, resulting in a financial windfall for sports betting operators, sports leagues and media and state governments alike,” Grove said.  His estimate of the illegal market does not include office pools and “social” or “casual” bets among friends that are included in some other estimates of illegal gambling that peg the market two or three times higher.  Grove said the exact size of the opportunity hinges on how many states decide to offer sports betting, and how willing they are to offer a product that can compete with the sizeable, well-established black market for sports betting.  Responding to the report, David Schwartz, director of the Center for Gaming Research at the University of Nevada Las Vegas, estimated a smaller potential market of about $1.4 billion, assuming each state that currently has casino gambling opts to offer sports betting as well. He also said he does not see all 50 states offering sports betting, at least anytime soon due to entrenched opposition to gambling in a handful of states.  Assuming the high court rules in New Jersey’s favor, Grove’s firm predicted 14 states would offer sports betting within two years: Colorado; Connecticut; Delaware; Indiana; Massachusetts; Michigan; Mississippi; Montana; New Jersey; Ohio; Nevada; Pennsylvania; Virginia; and West Virginia.  Within five years, it predicted 18 more would join: Arizona; California; Idaho; Illinois; Iowa; Kansas; Kentucky; Louisiana; Maine; Maryland; Missouri; New York; North Carolina; North Dakota; Oklahoma; Vermont; Washington and Wyoming.  And within seven years, another dozen could offer it as well: Alabama; Arkansas; Florida; Georgia; Minnesota; Nebraska; New Hampshire; New Mexico; Oregon; Rhode Island; South Dakota and Wisconsin. The remaining states might never offer sports betting, the Eilers & Krejcik Gaming report predicted.  The company’s estimates of when particular states might offer sports betting were determined by weighing questions including whether a state already has pending legislation, if there are Constitutional obstacles to expanding gambling; whether their gambling industry is united or divided; the general legislative attitude toward gambling as it exists now in a particular state, and how badly a state needs extra money.  Major professional and collegiate sports leagues oppose New Jersey’s effort to legalize sports betting, saying it would threaten the perceived integrity of the games.  New Jersey is taking aim at a law called the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 that forbids state-authorized sports gambling in all but four states that met a 1991 deadline to legalize it: Delaware, Montana, Nevada and Oregon. Nevada is the only state to allow single-game wagering.  ___  This story has been corrected to show Grove’s betting estimate is $60 billion, not $60 million.  ___  Follow Wayne Parry at http://twitter.com/WayneParryAC",3.3076923076923075,13,"[2.5, 4.0, 2.5, 3.0, 2.0, 3.5, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 2.5]"

Trump is aiming to make an end-run around some of President Barack Obama’s regulations, which he says circumvented Congress in the first place and cost American businesses and the economy billions of dollars. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)  WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration has set out to upend some of President Barack Obama’s regulations, which the White House says circumvented Congress in the first place and cost American businesses and the economy billions of dollars.  Without any major legislative accomplishments to point to despite the advantage of a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump on Monday was to give a speech in the White House East Room highlighting his own directives to agencies. The White House said the president is no longer attending the event following the mass killing of at least 50 people Sunday in Las Vegas. Vice President Mike Pence will lead it, but the White House closed the event to press coverage, an official there said.  There was no sign whether Pence will talk about gun regulations. During the presidential campaign, Trump cast himself as an ardent protector of the Second Amendment and proclaimed that if more “good guys” were armed with firearms there would be fewer gun tragedies. After the Orlando nightclub shooting, he suggested that if the club hadn’t been a gun-free zone, someone would have been able to stop the bloodshed.  Executive orders are less enduring than legislation because a president can overturn a predecessor’s policy. Obama reversed some of President George W. Bush’s executive orders, and Trump’s will be reviewed by his successor.  Neomi Rao, administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, estimated that Trump’s regulations will save about $300 million annually, but she did not explain how Office of Management and Budget analysts came up with that number.  Critics of the effort say regulations exist to ensure safety and fairness in the workplace and elsewhere. Public Citizen, a watchdog group, says the rollback of government guidelines are Trump and the Republican Party’s “craven attempt at self-enrichment and payback to corporate donors. In fact, robust regulation and enforcement are essential to economic prosperity.”  Some of the major changes Trump has made since taking office in January:  ___  YOUNG IMMIGRANTS  The latest Obama policy to fall is the program shielding from deportation hundreds of thousands of young people brought into the country as children and living here illegally. The Trump administration in September said the government would stop issuing new work permits while lawmakers debate whether the protections should be enshrined in law. In explaining his decision, Trump accused Obama of making “an end run around Congress” to protect those commonly referred to as “Dreamers.” Obama retorted that Trump’s action was a “cruel” and “self-defeating” decision tinged with politics. Democratic leaders and Trump said they have reached a deal to protect the immigrants, but Congress has since turned its focus to overhauling the tax code.  ___  CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENT  Trump has vowed to pull the United States out of the landmark Paris climate agreement through which nearly 200 countries have committed to combat global warming by reducing polluting emissions. He’s scrapped an Obama administration policy that let national parks ban the sale of bottled water to fight littering. He’s moved to rip up Obama’s Clean Power Plan, regulations that sought to reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants. His executive order on regulatory reform has been cited by EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt as a reason to delay or roll back a raft of Obama-era environmental regulations, from cleaning up water pollution from coal mines to blunting limits on emissions of toxic mercury from power plant smokestacks. The EPA is not among the 10 agencies expected to hold public briefings after Trump’s speech on Monday.  ___  EDUCATION  The Trump administration in September scrapped Obama-era guidance on investigating campus sexual assault, replacing it with new instructions that allow universities to require higher standards of evidence when handling complaints. His administration also annulled Obama’s accountability rules that were used to identify and help troubled schools and to evaluate teachers.  ___  TRANSGENDER ISSUES  Trump’s Education Department has lifted the Obama-era guidance to schools to allow transgender students to use the bathroom of their choice. The president also tweeted out word that transgender people would no longer be allowed to serve openly in the military, reversing an Obama administration provision and sending the Pentagon scrambling to draft new rules. In the meantime, any transgender troops now serving in the military can re-enlist in the next several months, the Pentagon said in September.  ___  MUSLIM TRAVEL  His initial executive order temporarily banning travel to the U.S. from several Muslim-majority countries and suspending the U.S. refugee program hit roadblocks in the courts. On his second attempt, the Supreme Court allowed only a sharply scaled-back version of the order to go forward pending arguments scheduled for October. When that order expired on Sept. 24, Trump signed a measure imposing new restrictions on travelers from citizens of Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen and North Korea. The Supreme Court then canceled the arguments and gave both sides time to explain whether the matter was now moot.  ___  Follow Kellman on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/APLaurieKellman",4.25,12,"[4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.5, 5.0, 4.5, 5.0, 3.5, 3.0, 5.0, 4.5]"

244,1534,10,3,2017,2017-10-03,Associated Press News,Lawmakers grill former Equifax chairman over data breach,"Former chairman and CEO of Equifax Richard F. Smith testifies before the Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection Subcommittee of the House Commerce Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Oct. 3, 2017. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)  WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans and Democrats on Tuesday grilled Equifax’s former chief executive over the massive data hack of the personal information of 145 million Americans, calling the company’s response inadequate as consumers struggle to deal with the breach.  Former Equifax CEO Richard Smith apologized for the compromise of such information as names, addresses, birth dates and Social Security numbers. Smith was the lone witness at the first of several Capitol Hill hearings this week. No current Equifax official testified.  “The criminal hack happened on my watch, and as CEO, I am ultimately responsible, and I take full responsibility,” Smith said. “I am here today to say to each and every person affected by this breach, I am truly and deeply sorry for what happened.”  Democrats favor legislation that they say would establish strong data security standards and prompt notification and relief for consumers when their information is hacked. But Republicans tamped down expectations for any congressional action as this year the GOP-led Congress has rolled back several Obama-era rules affecting businesses and the financial sector.  “Equifax deserves to be shamed in this hearing, but we should also ask what Congress has done, or failed to do, to stop data breaches from occurring,” said Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill.  Rep. Bob Latta, R-Ohio, the chairman of the subcommittee examining the breach, said there are already laws on the books that require companies to secure sensitive consumer data. He said hearings before four House and Senate panels this week should run their course before lawmakers make a decision about what to do next.  “The big thing we heard today is it was a very human error on their part” Latta said.  Separately, Equifax signed a $7.25 million contract last month with the Internal Revenue Service to verify taxpayer identities. The no-bid contract, first reported by Politico, is for Equifax to provide the IRS taxpayer and personal identity verification services.  The contract stated that Equifax was the only company capable of providing these services to the IRS, and it was deemed a “critical” service that couldn’t lapse.  Smith offered a timeline of what went wrong, saying the Department of Homeland Security warned the company on March 8 about the need to patch a particular vulnerability in software used by Equifax and other businesses. The company disseminated that warning by email the next day and requested that applicable personnel install the upgrade. The company’s policy requires the upgrade to occur within 48 hours, but that did not occur. The company’s information security department also ran scans on March 15 that did not pick up the vulnerability.  In late July, data security officials noticed suspicious activity on a website, which Smith said “happens routinely around our business.” He said an internal investigation ensued and he was alerted the next day, but he had no knowledge at that time that consumers’ personal information had been accessed.  Lawmakers pressed Smith about company executives selling stock in the company after the suspicious activity had been detected. On Aug. 1 and 2, Equifax Chief Financial Officer John Gamble and two other executives, Rodolfo Ploder and Joseph Loughran, sold a combined $1.8 million in stock.  Smith described the executives as “honorable men, men of integrity.” He said at that point in time the company was unaware that consumer data had been accessed.  Schakowsky said “for a lot of Americans, that just doesn’t pass the smell test.”  Smith said the full extent of what occurred emerged during a meeting he had with cybersecurity experts and outside counsel on Aug. 17. The board was alerted the following week and the public on Sept. 7, after the company had made plans for how it would try to help consumers respond.  The timeline laid out by Smith didn’t satisfy many lawmakers, who accused the company of being too slow.  “I worry that your job today is about damage control. You put a happy face on your firm’s disgraceful actions, and then depart with a golden parachute,” said Ben Ray Lujan, D-N.M. “Unfortunately, if fraudsters destroy my constituents’ savings and financial futures, there’s no golden parachute awaiting them.”  Lawmakers said that at one point Equifax tweeted the wrong link for consumers to check to learn if they were part of the breach.  “Talk about ham-handed responses, this is simply unacceptable,” said Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore.  Smith said he was disappointed in the rollout of call centers and a website designed to help the people affected by the breach. He said the company has increased its number of customer service representatives and the website has been improved. He said more than 400 million consumers contacted the company in the weeks following the announcement of the breach. He said the company wasn’t prepared for that kind of volume.  Lawmakers said they’re getting scores of calls from constituents concerned that their information was stolen and the potential ramifications in the years ahead. Rep. Ryan Costello, R-Pa., said hundreds of constituents have contacted his office about the company’s response.  “The slow rollout and how poorly it was done. To me, it was just inexcusable,” Costello said.  ___  Associated Press writer Ken Sweet in New York contributed.  ___  Follow Kevin Freking on Twitter at https://twitter.com/APkfreking",3.9375,16,"[1.5, 4.5, 3.0, 4.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.5, 2.5, 3.5, 1.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.5, 5.0]"
245,1535,10,3,2017,2017-10-03,Associated Press News,Another Wells Fargo CEO faces an angry Congress,"Wells Fargo Chief Executive Officer and President Timothy Sloan testifies before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Oct. 3, 2017, during a hearing on Wells Fargo after one year. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)  NEW YORK (AP) — A different Wells Fargo chief executive met a similar kind of anger from Congress on Tuesday, with politicians from both major parties saying they feel the bank has done little to change its culture since a scandal over its sales practices.  Tim Sloan appeared in front of the Senate Banking Committee in Washington, D.C., about a year since his predecessor did the same to try to explain how employees trying to meet ambitious sales goals created millions of accounts without customers knowing about or authorizing them.  Sloan apologized again and said the bank was committed to its customers. Some lawmakers weren’t in a forgiving mood. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat from North Dakota, expressed anger about the sales practices as well as a later auto insurance scandal involving customers signed up for coverage they didn’t want.  “We need to see a cultural change,” Heitkamp said. “I simply don’t hear it. We hear you say, ‘We don’t know! We will look into it! We care about the consumer!’ but I do not hear a level of cultural change that satisfies me today.”  Republicans were at times equally as upset.  “At least, we are irritated at Wells Fargo,” said Sen. Tim Scott, a Republican from South Carolina.  While Sloan said he remains “deeply sorry” for its previous sales practices, he was at times combative and defensive.  In particular, he strongly defended Wells Fargo’s practice of sending its customers into what’s known as forced arbitration, which is when customers have to use a third party to resolve their disputes instead of filing a class-action lawsuit with others.  Asked by Sen. Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, if Wells Fargo would consider ending that practice, Sloan responded with a curt “no.”  The sales practices scandal was the biggest in Wells Fargo’s history. When then-CEO John Stumpf faced Congress last fall, he was chastised for his answers and for what lawmakers saw as an attempt to shift blame. The bank’s once-sterling industry reputation was in tatters, and Stumpf was eventually ousted.  Wells Fargo ended up paying $185 million to regulators and settled a class-action suit for $142 million. It’s been trying to make amends with customers, politicians and the public.  Since last fall, Wells has changed its sales practices, ousted other executives and called tens of millions of customers to check on whether they truly opened the accounts.  “I apologize for the damage done to all the people who work and bank at this important American institution,” Sloan said.  The scandal has only grown since Stumpf’s appearance. The bank says up to 3.5 million fake accounts were opened between 2009 and 2016, up from the 2 million it acknowledged in September 2016. A report by the board of directors found the bad behavior could be traced back to as early as 2002, and that executives were aware of some sales practices problems as early as 2006.  After the sales practices came a new scandal: Wells Fargo admitted it signed up hundreds of thousands of auto loan customers for auto insurance they did not need. Some of those customers had their cars repossessed because they could not afford both the auto loan and insurance payments.  Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a vocal critic of Wells Fargo, called for Sloan’s firing.  One critique of Sloan, a 29-year veteran of the bank, has been that he was the chief financial officer while the fake accounts were being created. Wells Fargo and Sloan himself have defended his role, saying he was not supervising the consumer banking division at the time and therefore was not responsible for what occurred there.  “At best you are incompetent, at worst you were complicit,” Warren said. “And either way, you should be fired.”",3.0294117647058822,17,"[5.0, 1.0, 4.5, 4.5, 2.5, 0.5, 5.0, 2.0, 5.0, 5.0, 3.0, 0.5, 2.5, 4.5, 1.5, 2.5, 2.0]"

Thousands of private Cuban businesses have invested heavily in private homes, cars and restaurants, hoping to cash in on an expected wave of American travelers to the island. Now that the U.S. State Department has issued a travel warning for the country, their investments are at risk. (AP Photo/Desmond Boylan)  HAVANA (AP) — A U.S. State Department travel warning for Cuba following mysterious attacks that harmed nearly two dozen American diplomats has come like a bucket of cold water for the aspirations of thousands of private entrepreneurs on the island.  Amid a sudden diplomatic thaw between the Cold War foes that began in 2014, many Cubans invested heavily in privately run restaurants, homestay B&Bs and cars to operate as taxi cabs in hopes of cashing in on an expected boom of American tourists.  But now entrepreneurs worry Americans will be frightened away — even though there has been no word of any tourists affected.  Nowhere are such fears more pronounced than in Old Havana, where many Cubans bought into a hot real estate market as part of a proliferation of B&Bs catering to the hordes of tourists who stroll its cobblestoned streets each day.  “We got to work opening businesses, bars, restaurants, rental homes, and many people invested everything we had, and even borrowed,” said Yunaika Estanque, the 51-year-old owner of a three-room hostel.  Estanque partnered with her parents and two children. They all sold other properties and sought additional financial backing from a friend who lives overseas, and two years ago bought a rickety colonial home steps from the Bay of Havana.  Today it has been spruced up and reborn as the Mi Tierra (My Land) hostel, whose polished vintage floors, warm pastel walls, republican-era furniture and modern air conditioning make for attractive and affordable digs at just $35 a night per person plus $5 more for breakfast.  Mi Tierra opened its doors about two months ago and has received mostly European travelers so far, but it’s Americans that Estanque truly has in mind long-term.  “American tourists consume a lot and leave good tips,” said Estanque, who speaks English and uses it with guests to make them feel welcome. “Now there is going to be a lot of supply, but relatively little demand.”  In addition to the travel warning announced Friday, the State Department also said it was reducing by about 60 percent its diplomatic staff at the U.S. Embassy in Havana and indefinitely suspending visa processing in Cuba. On Tuesday, Washington went further, expelling 15 Cuban diplomats to protest Havana’s failure to protect American envoys from the attacks, which have not been explained.  The United States has not accused Cuba of being behind the attacks. President Raul Castro’s government has disavowed any culpability and called the U.S. response “reckless,” ″hasty” and politically motivated.  Tourism is an important source of badly needed foreign currency for Cuba, one of a handful of key sectors that keep its weak economy sputtering along.  Last year about 4 million travelers visited the island, according to government statistics. That included 281,000 Americans, up from just 91,000 in 2014. There were also 400,000 visits last year by Cubans living overseas, the vast majority of whom reside in the United States.  U.S. tourism to Cuba is still small compared with the numbers already coming from Canada, Europe and elsewhere. But analysts have predicted that if the U.S. embargo on Cuba were to be lifted entirely, 1 million or more American travelers could inundate the island on an annual basis.  It’s too early to tell how significantly American tourists may be discouraged by the State Department warning. Nevertheless, people with skin in the game are watching closely.  With the increase in American travelers in the last three years, “there was a positive effect and a desire to improve the level of services, of quality,” said Martin Payne, a Briton who lives on the island and represents a U.K. tour agency. “With this (possible) decrease, we’ll see if the momentum continues or if a fall is on the way.”  “A lot of people wanted to come to Cuba before the American avalanche. ... The Europeans are going to say, ’Well, (now) we can wait, there’s no rush,” Payne added. “It will go on the list to visit in the future.”  Measures announced by U.S. President Donald Trump in June had already sought to limit American travel to Cuba somewhat by barring so-called people-to-people educational trips outside of those run by licensed operators.  Despite assurances that the goal was to support Cuba’s burgeoning class of independent entrepreneurs, those measures were seen as likely to steer U.S. travelers away from privately run B&Bs and restaurants and toward the government-run hotels and eateries that have larger capacity and long-established relationships with tour operators.  If tourism suffers it would add to a list of other economic woes in Cuba, which had its energy grid and agricultural sector hammered by Hurricane Irma. Venezuela, Cuba’s most important ally and commercial partner, is in the throes of a far more severe economic crisis and has been forced to cut back oil shipments on terms seen as preferential for Havana.  Many who depend on the tourism industry say they already noticed a lull in September, when the hurricane hit, after several years when suddenly it seemed the high season was lasting year-round.  “We live off tourism, and right now my household income comes from this taxi,” said Alejandro Sito, a 25-year-old cabbie who was waiting for fares in front of a hotel in the capital.  “How are we going to support ourselves?” asked his colleague, 34-year-old Angel Hernandez. “It’s going to get tough for us.”  ___  Andrea Rodriguez on Twitter at www.twitter.com/ARodriguezAP",3.588235294117647,17,"[4.0, 3.5, 3.0, 5.0, 2.5, 0.5, 4.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 1.5, 1.5, 4.5, 4.0, 5.0, 3.5]"

More online retailers are chasing after plus-sized men, selling big sizes of slim-cut jeans, faux leather jackets and other trendy clothing that can be hard to find at the local big and tall store. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)  NEW YORK (AP) — Chris Cyr doesn’t like much about the big and tall clothes he finds in stores: They’re “not very adventurous,” he says, and the fit can be too baggy. And then there’s the array of odd prints: “A lot of Hawaiian shirts with sailboats and golf balls tend to pop in.”  But the standup comic from St. Louis says he is finding more fashionable threads for bigger guys online, as a crop of internet retailers are finally catering to the long-ignored group. The companies are making larger sizes of slim-cut jeans, bomber jackets and other trendy clothes that shoppers say are hard to find elsewhere.  Bigger-sized models are used when designing the clothes, which the companies say helps make sure the proportions are right. Rather than just making a pair of jeans larger, for example, they also adjust the back pockets and other details.  Asos, the hip online clothing seller, launched a line for plus-sized men late last year. MVP Collections, founded a year ago, sells velour hoodies in sizes up to 6XL and motorcycle jeans that go up to a size 54. And The Winston Box, which calls itself a clothing subscription service “for guys with some junk in the trunk,” sends up to four items a month to members.  Big guys want to look stylish, too. Although they've always had big and tall shops to turn to, many shoppers say they don’t find the trendy clothes they crave there. Now, a crop of online retailers are finally catering to the long-ignored group. (Oct. 4)  “There’s a lot more options,” says Cyr. He pays $75 a month for The Winston Box, and says the 3XL shirts he receives fit better than what he finds elsewhere. He also recently bought a blazer from Asos that he wears to his standup shows.  Men have long had big-and-tall shops to turn to, but young shoppers say they don’t find the trendy clothes they crave there. Kyle Gammon, a college fashion student who lives near Savannah, Georgia, says Asos has become his go-to after he discovered its plus-size line earlier this year. While fit can sometimes be a question for anyone buying online, Gammon has bought a couple of print shirts from the site. He likes the way they fit, giving him just enough room around his midsection without a lot of extra fabric in the arms. He’s also a fan of the colors and styles the site offers.  “They have a really good variety,” says Gammon, “which I’m not used to getting.”  Former baseball player Mo Vaughn, who co-founded MVP Collections, says he could find T-shirts and suits in his size in stores, but nothing in between. Now his company sells items such as gray sport jackets and deconstructed jeans made with a bit of spandex for stretch.  “Why can’t we be fly like everybody else?” Vaughn says.  Daniel Franzese, an actor who starred in “Mean Girls,” joined The Winston Box as creative director earlier this year after seeing an ad for the company on Facebook. He says stylists often had trouble finding clothes for him to wear for TV roles or for red carpet events.  “Fashion forgets about the bigger male,” Franzese says.  That’s still generally true, even with the new options. Several market research firms said they didn’t track or have estimates of the value of the men’s big-and-tall clothing market. And startups say that to promote their brands, they go to conventions and events around the country aimed at curvy or plus-size women — because there aren’t any for big men.  Diana Smith, a retail and apparel analyst at research group Mintel, expects that to change. She says the high obesity rate, plus an increase in the number of men who care about how they dress, will increase the demand for big-sized men’s clothing. She says the success of women’s plus-size clothing, which according to NPD Group had sales of $20.6 billion in the last year, also helps.  “There’s a lot of buying power there,” says Smith.  At Asos, it was the positive feedback from its women’s plus-size line launched about eight years ago that pushed the company to create one for men, says head designer Nick Eley. Asos says about 15 percent of its men’s line is now available in bigger sizes, and it expects to increase that percentage. About 30 brands, such as Puma and Tommy Hilfiger, also make big and tall sizes for the site.  “I honestly don’t know why it’s been a forgotten market for so long,” says Eley.  _____  Associated Press video journalist Teresa Crawford in Chicago contributed to this report.  _____  Contact Joseph Pisani at http://twitter.com/josephpisani",3.5625,16,"[4.0, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5, 1.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 3.0, 3.0, 4.5, 1.5, 3.5, 0.5, 3.5, 5.0]"

KEEPING SCORE: In Europe, France’s CAC 40 lost 0.4 percent to 5,347 while Germany’s DAX rose 0.1 percent to 12,914. Britain’s FTSE 100 was down 0.1 percent at 7,463. Wall Street was poised to open slightly lower, with Dow and S&P 500 futures both slipping less than 0.1 percent.  LOOKING FOR LEADS: After Wall Street indexes hit record highs this week, investors were in search of fresh leads from U.S. data later in the day, including the monthly private ADP payroll report and the ISM non-manufacturing index. The figures will provide the latest insights into the world’s biggest economy, which could factor into the Federal Reserve’s plan to raise interest rates again by the end of the year.  FED: a speech by Fed Chair Janet Yellen as speculation swirls over who President Donald Trump will tap to lead the U.S. central bank when her term ends early next year. The uncertainty has left the dollar in limbo. White House officials said last week Trump has met with former Fed board member Kevin Warsh, and current member Jerome Powell. But Trump has said he could re-nominate Yellen.  QUOTEWORTHY: “The focus may also be brought to the next Fed chair with Fed’s Yellen’s speech,” said Jingyi Pan, market strategist at IG in Singapore. “Although the names on the list may be of little surprise to the market, the conversation is expected to further heat up on this development.”  ASIAN SCORECARD: Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index flitted between gains and losses before ending less than 0.1 percent higher at 20,626.66 while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng advanced 0.7 percent to 28,379.18. Both indexes were at two-year highs. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.9 percent to 5,652.10 and Southeast Asian indexes were mixed. Stock markets were closed in mainland China, South Korea and Taiwan for holidays.  ENERGY: Oil futures fell further. Benchmark U.S. crude lost 13 cents to $50.29 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract dipped 16 cents to settle at $50.42 per barrel on Tuesday. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, fell 19 cents to $55.81 per barrel.  CURRENCIES: The dollar slipped to 112.46 Japanese yen from 112.86 yen late Tuesday.

260,1570,10,4,2017,2017-10-04,Associated Press News,Gunman’s secret life thwarts investigators’ hunt for motive," The gunman behind the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history led a secret life that has so far thwarted investigators trying to figure out a motive for the attack.  In an effort to try to crack Stephen Paddock’s state of mind, the FBI spent hours on Wednesday interviewing his longtime girlfriend, who returned Tuesday from a weekslong overseas trip and said she had no inkling of the massacre he was plotting when he sent her to see family in her native Philippines.  “He never said anything to me or took any action that I was aware of that I understood in any way to be a warning that something horrible like this was going to happen,” Marilou Danley, 62, said in a statement read by her lawyer outside FBI headquarters in Los Angeles.  Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said it’s difficult to believe Paddock acted alone in the attack Sunday that killed 58 and injured nearly 500 people at a country music concert on the Las Vegas Strip.  “Maybe he’s a super guy,” Lombardo said before catching himself and calling it the wrong word. “You know, a super yay-hoo that was working out all this on his own. But it would be hard for me to believe that.”  Authorities said Stephen Paddock had spent decades acquiring weapons and ammunition to ""meticulously"" plan the worst domestic attack in U.S. history. Calling him ""disturbed"" and ""dangerous,"" investigators are still trying to determine a motive. (Oct. 5)  Danley, whom authorities had previously called “a person of interest,” had been expected to provide insight into the mind of Paddock, a frustratingly opaque figure who carried out his high-rise massacre without leaving the plain-sight clues often found after major acts of bloodshed.  Lombardo said Wednesday that Paddock had 1,600 rounds of ammunition and several containers of an explosive commonly used in target shooting that totaled 50 pounds (23 kilograms) in his car. But it wasn’t clear what, if anything, Paddock planned with the explosives, he said.  Paddock, who set up surveillance cameras in his room and to see anyone approaching outside, also had an escape plan, Lombardo said, though he fatally shot himself as police closed in on his luxury suite on the 32nd-floor of the Mandalay Bay resort casino. Lombardo declined to say what led authorities to believe he planned an escape.  The previous weekend, Paddock had rented a high-rise condo in a building that overlooked the Life is Beautiful alternative music festival featuring Chance the Rapper, Muse, Lorde and Blink-182, said Lombardo, who offered no other details about what led Paddock there.  On Sept. 28, the 64-year-old high-stakes gambler and real estate investor checked into Mandalay Bay and specifically requested an upper-floor room with a view of the Route 91 Harvest music festival, according to a person who has seen hotel records turned over to investigators.  Paddock wasn’t able to move into the room until Saturday, said the person, who was not authorized to speak publicly and disclosed the information to the AP on condition of anonymity.  The room, which goes for $590, was given to Paddock for free because he was a good customer who wagered tens of thousands of dollars each time he visited the casino, the person said.  Paddock wired $100,000 to the Philippines days before the shooting, said a U.S. official who was not authorized to speak publicly because of the continuing investigation. Investigators are trying to trace that money.  Danley, who was overseas for more than two weeks, said she was initially pleased when she was wired money from Paddock to buy a house for her family in the Philippines. But she later feared it was a way to break up with her.  She said she loved Paddock as a “kind, caring, quiet man” and hoped they would have a future together. She said she was devastated by the carnage and would cooperate with authorities as they struggle to get inside Paddock’s mind.  While Paddock had a passion for high-stakes gambling at Nevada casinos, his game of choice was video poker, a relatively solitary pursuit with no dealer and no humans to play against. And while neighbors described Paddock as friendly, he wasn’t close to them.  “He was a private guy. That’s why you can’t find out anything about him,” his brother Eric Paddock said from his home in Florida. As for what triggered the massacre, the brother said, “Something happened that drove him into the pit of hell.”  Paddock had no known criminal history. Public records contained no indication of any financial problems, and his brother described him as a wealthy real estate investor.  President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump met privately with victims at a Las Vegas hospital Wednesday and then with police officers and dispatchers, praising them and the doctors who treated the wounded.

261,1571,10,3,2017,2017-10-03,Associated Press News,APNewsBreak: White House to seek $29B disaster aid package," The Trump administration is finalizing a $29 billion disaster aid package that combines $16 billion to shore up the government-backed flood insurance program with almost $13 billion in new relief for hurricane victims, according to a senior administration official and top congressional aides.  The huge request is expected to be officially sent to Congress on Wednesday, but its outlines were characterized by officials who demanded anonymity because the $29 billion measure is not yet public.  The request would address two pressing needs. The first is to pump money into the flood insurance program, which is rapidly running out of cash to pay an influx of claims from victims of hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. At the same time, the Federal Emergency Management Agency continues to spend money for disaster relief operations at a high rate and requires more money.  The government-guaranteed flood insurance program is maxing out on a $30 billion line of credit from Treasury; the upcoming proposal would wipe $16 billion of that debt off the books to permit the program to pay claims from hurricane victims.  Almost $13 billion is being requested for FEMA, and federal firefighting accounts would receive $577 million as well to replenish them after a disastrous season of Western wildfires.  “This is going to be extraordinarily expensive and I think we need to get some money out there,” said House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-N.J.  House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said he had met with lawmakers from Texas and Florida on Tuesday to brief them on the White House request.  “Remember, this is emergency money. You’ve got to deal with the problem,” McCarthy told reporters. “So I think we’ll be able to get this done.”  The request could prove controversial, especially the huge infusion into the flood insurance program. Conservatives are likely to liken it to a taxpayer bailout, but the program is enormously important to homeowners in hurricane-ravaged Texas and Florida, as well as other coastal states.  Congress is in the midst of an effort to reauthorize the troubled flood insurance program, which critics say makes taxpayers subsidize properties that have repeatedly flooded. A bipartisan effort to reform the program was enacted in 2012 but was significantly watered down just two years later after widespread complaints of huge premium increases and resulting disruptions in coastal real estate markets.  Congress last month approved a $15.3 billion aid package that nearly doubled President Donald Trump’s request. Senate Republicans added $7.4 billion in community development block grant rebuilding funds to Trump’s request for immediate cleanup, repair and housing costs.  Later this year, the White House is expected to require tens of billions of dollars more in long-term funds that would rebuild infrastructure, help people without insurance restore their homes, and, perhaps, help Puerto Rico reconstitute its shattered electrical grid.  Trump surveyed Hurricane damage in Puerto Rico on Tuesday. He praised his administration’s response, even as lawmakers returning from the island say the president is painting far too rosy a picture.  “What you’re seeing is a mirage,” Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., said of conditions in San Juan, where Trump visited and where many reporters are located. Many mountain towns are cut off, with sick and elderly people trapped. “I saw the video on TV and everybody’s friendly and everybody’s smiling. You know what? It gave the wrong impression of what’s going on in the island.”",1.5,1,[1.5]
278,1610,10,4,2017,2017-10-04,Associated Press News,Tillerson denies he weighed resigning or called boss ‘moron’,"Secretary of State Rex Tillerson turns away from a podium, to return to his office, after making a statement at the State Department in Washington, Wednesday, Oct. 4, 2017. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Rex Tillerson declared Wednesday he never considered resigning as President Donald Trump’s top diplomat, disputing what he called “erroneous” reports that he wanted to step down earlier this year. After pointedly refusing to answer if he called the president a “moron,” Tillerson had a spokeswoman deny he used such language.  Thrust into the spotlight under uncomfortable circumstances, the normally camera-shy Tillerson sought to rebut a widely disseminated NBC News story that claimed Vice President Mike Pence had to talk the former oil man out of resigning over the summer, and that Tillerson had questioned Trump’s intelligence. The explosive claims followed several instances in which Trump and Tillerson’s policy pronouncements have appeared to clash.  “There has never been a consideration in my mind to leave,” Tillerson told reporters in an unusually personal address from the State Department’s staid 7th-floor Treaty Room outside of his office.  From Las Vegas, where he traveled to meet with medical personnel and others affected by the mass shooting there, Trump told reporters he has “total confidence” in Tillerson. Earlier, Trump denounced the report as “fake news” on Twitter.  Rex Tillerson says he has never considered leaving his post as secretary of state. (Oct. 4)  Trump’s administration already had seen an unprecedented wave of departures, including a chief of staff, a national security adviser and a Cabinet secretary. However, his core national security team — Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and his second national security adviser, H.R. McMaster — has been viewed by Republicans and even many Democrats as a pillar of stability in an otherwise chaotic government.  Even so, Trump has at times appeared to undercut Tillerson’s message on some of America’s most sensitive national security challenges, including Iran and North Korea. Tillerson also has publicly complained about the White House blocking him from making key appointments.  Sen. Bob Corker, the Foreign Relations Committee chairman, said Tillerson hasn’t been sufficiently supported and “is in an incredibly frustrating place.” The Republican senator, who has criticized Trump’s leadership, offered a stark assessment: Tillerson, Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly are “those people that help separate our country from chaos.”  While praising Trump’s foreign policy on Wednesday, Tillerson raised eyebrows by pointedly declining to deny he had called the president a “moron” after a contentious meeting at the Pentagon in July.  “I’m not going to deal with petty stuff like that,” the former Exxon Mobil CEO said. “I mean, this is what I don’t understand about Washington. Again, I’m not from this place, but the places I come from, we don’t deal with that kind of petty nonsense.”  “Let me tell you what I’ve learned about this president, whom I did not know before taking this office,” Tillerson said. “He loves his country. He puts Americans and America first. He’s smart. He demands results wherever he goes, and he holds those around him accountable for whether they’ve done the job he’s asked them to do.”  Later, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert flatly denied that Tillerson called Trump a moron. She said Tillerson hasn’t said sorry to Trump, as no apology was needed.  Pence backed up Tillerson’s account by saying the two men never discussed the “prospect of the secretary’s resignation from the administration.”  “Any reporting to the contrary is categorically false,” Pence’s statement said.  NBC said Tillerson had been on the verge of resigning this summer amid mounting policy disputes with the White House. It said the tensions came to a head around the time Trump gave a politicized speech in July to the Boy Scouts of America, an organization Tillerson once led. The network claimed Pence and Mattis convinced Tillerson to stay.  A person familiar with the conversation also disputed that the vice president sought to coax the secretary of state into not quitting. The discussion instead focused on easing tensions between Tillerson and the White House and finding a way for him to operate better within the Cabinet, said the individual who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly on the private discussion and demanded anonymity.  Trump himself pounced on the NBC report, before and after Tillerson offered his side of the story.  “The @NBCNews story has just been totally refuted by Sec. Tillerson and @VP Pence. It is #FakeNews. They should issue an apology to AMERICA!” Trump tweeted.  NBC stood by its reporting.  Tillerson sought to broach the story in the typically somber and methodical manner he has approached being secretary of state. He framed his response as a defense of Trump’s entire “America First” foreign policy, and his own place within that strategy. He also noted the diplomatic successes of Nikki Haley, Trump’s U.N. ambassador, with whom he has been privately clashing for several months.  “President Trump’s foreign policy goals break the mold of what people traditionally think of what is achievable,” Tillerson said.  Tillerson appeared most frustrated that talk of his resignation is persisting despite previous denials.  “I have answered that question repeatedly. For some reason, it continues to be misreported,” he said.  ___  Associated Press writers Ken Thomas, Matthew Pennington, Jill Colvin and Richard Lardner contributed.",5.0,1,[5.0]

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)  LAS VEGAS (AP) — Solemn in the face of tragedy, President Donald Trump visited hospital bedsides and a vital police base in stricken Las Vegas, offering prayers and condolences to the victims of Sunday night’s shooting massacre.  The president also singled out for praise the first responders and doctors who rushed to save lives, saying “America is truly a nation in mourning.” His appearance in the city came just days after a gunman holed up on the 32nd floor of a hotel and casino opened fire on a crowd at an outdoor country music festival below. At least 58 people were killed and more than 500 were injured from the gunfire and the chaotic situation as concert-goers tried to flee.  Trump at one point spoke of families who “tonight will go to bed in a world that is suddenly empty.”  “Our souls are stricken with grief for every American who lost a husband or a wife, a mother or a father, a son or a daughter,” he told them. “We know that your sorrow feels endless. We stand together to help you carry your pain. ”  It was a somber address from a provocateur president who prides himself on commanding strength but occasionally has struggled to project empathy in times of tragedy.  President Donald Trump somberly thanked first responders who rushed to help after the mass shooting in Las Vegas, telling them Wednesday that ""America is truly a nation in mourning."" (Oct. 4)  Trump’s solemn words in Las Vegas offered a sharp contrast to his trip a day earlier to hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico, where he spoke of the “expensive” recovery effort on the island and noted the relatively low death toll there compared with “a real catastrophe like Katrina” in 2005.  In prepared remarks, he spoke of the courage displayed by those who risked or lost their lives saving loved ones and total strangers. He described an eyewitness account of police officers standing as bullets slammed around them and trying to direct concert-goers to safety.  Trump also described a military veteran who had rushed to the scene in search of loved ones, but quickly turned to helping victims, using plastic barriers as gurneys for the injured and frantically searching for anything he could use to make splints.  “The example of those whose final act was to sacrifice themselves for those they love should inspire all of us to show more love every day for the people who grace our lives,” Trump said.  The president spent about four hours in a city still reeling from the worst mass shooting in modern American history.  His first stop was the University Medical Center, where he spent over 90 minutes visiting with recovering victims, some with severe injuries, and listening to their stories. While a serious visit, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said there was laughter and celebration in some of the visits with some of the families affected by the shooting. Trump also met with about 100 medical professionals.  Sanders said the visit was a moving experience for the president, who lingered at the hospital longer than planned.  He said after the visit that he’d met “some of the most amazing people” and invited them to visit the White House.  Generous with superlatives, Trump also commended the doctors for doing an “indescribable” job.  One of the patients who met with Trump told The Associated Press he was “super nice and super caring.”  Tiffany Huizar, 18, a high school student who lives in Santa Ana, Calif., is recovering from bullet wounds in the stomach and elbow. She said Trump “was very comforting and like a father figure. ... I feel like a lot of people have negative views about him and what he posts on Twitter and social media and he was absolutely a different guy today in the hospital.”  Trump did not visit the site of the shooting, but on his trip from the airport, his motorcade drove past the Mandalay Bay hotel where the gunman carried the shooting rampage.  Trump has a long personal connection to Las Vegas — a city where his name is written in huge golden letters atop his hotel. He also campaigned extensively across Nevada during his presidential campaign, drawing large crowds to rallies along The Strip.  ___  Colvin reported from Washington.

Gabby Giffords of Arizona who survived an assassination attempt in 2011, flanked by Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif., left, and Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., right, joins House Democrats in a call for action on gun safety legislation on the House steps Wednesday morning after the deadly mass shooting in Las Vegas this week, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, Oct. 4, 2017. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Senior congressional Republicans said Wednesday they are open to considering legislation banning “bump stocks” like the shooter in Las Vegas apparently used to make semi-automatic rifles perform more like fully automatic weapons.  The comments from lawmakers including the No. 2 Senate Republican, John Cornyn of Texas, marked a surprising departure from GOP lawmakers’ general antipathy to gun regulations of any kind. But they were far from a guarantee of a path forward for the new legislation by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., especially with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan making clear their priorities are elsewhere.  “If somebody can essentially convert a semi-automatic weapon by buying one of these and utilizing it and cause the kind of mayhem and mass casualties that we saw in Las Vegas, that’s something of obvious concern that we ought to explore,” Cornyn told reporters.  “I own a lot of guns and as a hunter and sportsman I think that’s our right as Americans, but I don’t understand the use of this bump stock and that’s another reason to have a hearing.”  Cornyn later said he’d spoken with Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, and that Grassley was interested in convening a hearing.  Congressman John Lewis joined fellow Democratic representatives outside the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday to call for action on gun legislation. He indicated Republicans were not focusing on the issue at hand after the deadly Las Vegas shooting. (Oct. 4)  The devices, known as “bump stocks” among other names, are legal and originally were intended to help people with limited hand mobility fire a semi-automatic without the individual trigger pulls required. They can fit over the rear shoulder-stock assembly on a semi-automatic rifle and with applied pressure cause the weapon to fire continuously, increasing the rate from between 45 and 60 rounds per minute to between 400 and 800 rounds per minute, according to Feinstein’s office.  The government gave its seal of approval to selling the devices in 2010 after concluding that they did not violate federal law.  Feinstein has a career-long history on the issue of guns after becoming mayor in San Francisco after her predecessor was gunned down. She authored an assault weapons ban that was in place for a decade before expiring in 2004, and said she had been considering trying to reintroduce that more sweeping legislation, as she’s done unsuccessfully after past mass shootings, including the one at Sandy Hook elementary school in Connecticut. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer urged her to go with a narrower bill that might be likelier to draw support.  Feinstein pleaded with the public to pressure Congress to consider her legislation after the horrific violence earlier this week when a gunman killed 58 people and injured hundreds at an outdoor concert that she said her own daughter had considered attending.  “Mr. and Mrs. America, you have to stand up, you have to say ‘enough is enough,’” Feinstein said. “Why can’t we keep a weapon from becoming a military-grade weapon?”  The National Rifle Association, which has played a major role in exerting political pressure against gun curbs, did not respond to inquiries about its stance on Feinstein’s bill.  At least one Republican senator, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, said outright he was prepared to vote to ban bump stocks. “I have no problem in banning those,” he said.  Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 3 Republican senator, said, “I’m interest in finding out more about bump stocks and I’ve got my staff looking into that and I know there are other members interested in finding out more about it as well.”  Even so, asked Tuesday about bump stocks and whether they should be legal, McConnell, R-Ky., said it was not an appropriate time to be discussing legislation.  Ryan, R-Wis., made similar comments Wednesday in a radio interview on WISN in Milwaukee.  “What I don’t think you want your government to do is to lurch toward reactions before even having all the facts,” Ryan said. “Bad people are going to do bad things.”  In the House, meanwhile, Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., introduced a bill to ban the manufacture, possession, transfer, sale or importation of bump stocks. Rep. Dina Titus, D-Nev., whose district includes the site of Sunday night’s rampage, said: “The victims and families in Las Vegas don’t need an explanation about the difference between machine guns and firearms with bump stocks. They need action.”  Congress’ recent history gives little cause to think Republicans would take any action on guns. Even after the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting where schoolchildren were slaughtered, Feinstein’s reintroduced assault weapons ban went nowhere, and bipartisan background check legislation by Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania fell short on the Senate floor.  Last year, after the mass shooting at a dance club in Orlando, Florida, Democrats commandeered the House floor to protest GOP inaction on guns, but while garnering headlines the tactic did not yield results. Shooting incidents involving lawmakers themselves, like at a baseball practice earlier this year where Majority Whip Steve Scalise was critically injured, have not changed the calculus.  Feinstein held out hope that this time would be different because of the scale of casualties and the weaponry “taking it into war.” And Manchin said that he planned to meet with Toomey on the background checks bill, but would not reintroduce it without significant GOP support, which he said “ain’t going to happen unless the president gives his stamp of approval.”  President Donald Trump visited Las Vegas on Wednesday but said “We’re not going to talk about that today” when asked about gun issues.  ___=  Associated Press writer Matthew Daly contributed.",4.5,1,[4.5]

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Students who attended for-profit colleges were twice as likely or more to default on their loans than students who attended public schools, according to a federal study published Thursday.  The report by the National Center of Education Statistics looks at students who began their undergraduate education in 2003 and defaulted on at least one loan over the next 12 years. Fifty-two percent of the students who attended for-profit schools defaulted on their loan. That’s compared to 17 percent for those who attended a four-year public institution and 26 percent at community college.  The report also finds that the for-profit students defaulted on their federal student loans in greater numbers than their predecessors eight years before.  The report comes as Education Secretary Betsy DeVos rewrites rules that had been put in place by the Obama administration to protect students who said they were defrauded by their for-profit colleges.  The study also found that this group of students is defaulting on federal student loans in greater numbers than their predecessors eight years before.  Of the students who started college in 2003, 27 percent had defaulted on at least one loan after 12 years, the study found. For those who started their undergraduate education in 1995, the default rate was 18 percent. The rate of full repayment was 20 percent in the younger group, compared to 24 in the older group.  Robert Kelchen, a professor of education at Seton Hall University, suggested that the higher rate among the 2003 freshmen might be due to them entering the labor market at the height of the Great Recession.  Default rates were higher for those students who never completed their education, the study said. “Degree completion is a key component of a student’s ability to repay their loan,” said Joshua Goodman, a professor of public policy at Harvard University. “Simply attending college without completion doesn’t really pay off.”  Among borrowers in the 2003 group, the median amount owed after 12 years was $3,700 for those who earned undergraduate certificates, $11,700 for students getting associate’s degrees and $13,800 for bachelor’s degrees or higher.",3.6,25,"[3.5, 4.5, 4.0, 1.5, 3.0, 5.0, 2.5, 0.5, 2.5, 1.5, 5.0, 1.0, 2.5, 4.5, 4.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 3.0, 4.5, 4.5, 5.0, 2.5, 5.0, 5.0]"

Infotainment technology automakers are cramming into the dashboard of new vehicles is making drivers take their eyes off the road and hands off the wheel for dangerously long periods of time, a study being released by AAA on Oct. 5 says. (AP Photo/Bill Gorman)  WASHINGTON (AP) — The infotainment technology that automakers are cramming into the dashboard of new vehicles is making drivers take their eyes off the road and hands off the wheel for dangerously long periods of time, an AAA study says.  The study released Thursday is the latest by University of Utah professor David Strayer, who has been examining the impact of infotainment systems on safety for AAA’s Foundation for Traffic Safety since 2013. Past studies also identified problems, but Strayer said the “explosion of technology” has made things worse.  Automakers now include more infotainment options to allow drivers to use social media, email and text. The technology is also becoming more complicated to use. Cars used to have a few buttons and knobs. Some vehicles now have as many as 50 buttons on the steering wheel and dashboard that are multi-functional. There are touch screens, voice commands, writing pads, heads-up displays on windshields and mirrors and 3-D computer-generated images.  “It’s adding more and more layers of complexity and information at drivers’ fingertips without often considering whether it’s a good idea to put it at their fingertips,” Strayer said. That complexity increases the overall amount of time drivers spend trying to use the systems.  The auto industry says the new systems are better alternatives for drivers than mobile phones and navigation devices that were not designed to be used while driving.  The vehicle-integrated systems “are designed to be used in the driving environment and require driver attention that is comparable to tuning the radio or adjusting climate controls, which have always been considered baseline acceptable behaviors while driving,” said Wade Newton, a spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers.  But Jake Nelson, AAA’s director for traffic safety advocacy and research, said drivers testing all 30 of the 2017 model year cars and light trucks took their eyes off the road and hands off the wheel while using infotainment systems. The test drivers used voice commands, touch screens and other interactive technologies to make calls, send texts, tune the radio or program navigation all while driving.  Clearly automakers haven’t worked hard enough to make the systems quick and easy to use, Nelson said. Researchers rated 23 of the 30 vehicles “very high” or “high” in terms of the attention they demanded from drivers. Seven were rated “moderate.” None required a low amount of attention to use.  Programming a destination into in-vehicle GPS navigation systems was the most distracting activity, taking drivers an average of 40 seconds to complete the task. At 25 mph (40 kph), a car can travel the length of four football fields during the time it takes to enter a destination. Previous research has shown that drivers who remove their eyes from the road for just two seconds double their risk for a crash.  Under pressure from industry, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 2012 issued voluntary safety guidelines to automakers for dashboard technology instead of enforceable safety standards. The guidelines recommend that automakers lock out the ability to program navigation systems while a car is moving. However, the ability to program navigation while driving was available in 12 vehicles in the study.  The guidelines also recommend automakers prevent drivers from texting while driving, but three-quarters of the vehicles tested permit drivers to text while the car is moving. Texting was the second-most distracting task performed by test drivers.  Drivers looked away from the road less when using voice commands, but that safety benefit was offset by the increased amount of time drivers spent interacting with the systems.  AAA said drivers should use infotainment technologies “only for legitimate emergencies or urgent, driving-related purposes.” It also urged automakers to block the ability to program navigation systems or send texts while driving. Automakers should also design infotainment systems so that they require no more attention to use than listening to the radio or an audiobook, it said.  Nearly 70 percent of U.S. adults say they want the new technologies in their vehicles, but only 24 percent feel that the technology already works perfectly, according to an opinion survey conducted for AAA.  “Drivers want technology that is safe and easy to use,” said Marshall Doney, AAA’s president and CEO, “but many of the features added to infotainment systems today have resulted in overly complex and sometimes frustrating user experiences for drivers.”  ___  Follow Joan Lowy on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/AP_Joan_Lowy",4.5,24,"[3.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.0, 5.0, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 4.5]"
307,1642,10,6,2017,2017-10-06,Associated Press News,Restrictions on ‘bump stock’ would take action from Congress,"In this Oct. 4, 2017, photo, a device called a ""bump stock"" is attached to a semi-automatic rifle at the Gun Vault store and shooting range in South Jordan, Utah. The National Rifle Association announced its support Ton Oct. 5 for regulating the devices that can effectively convert semi-automatic rifles into fully automated weapons and that were apparently used in the Las Vegas massacre to lethal effect. It was a surprising shift for the leading gun industry group, which in recent years has resolutely opposed any gun regulations. Immediately afterward the White House, too, said it was open to such a change. (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer)  WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives could reconsider the lawfulness of “bump stock” devices like the ones used by the Las Vegas gunman only if Congress amends existing gun laws or passes new legislation banning the accessories that allow semi-automatic rifles to mimic machine guns.  The agency, in describing its processes generally on Friday, indicated that Congress, already preparing for next year’s mid-term elections, will be responsible for decisions about regulating or banning the devices. The National Rifle Association and some lawmakers had been encouraging the firearms agency to re-examine its judgment in 2010 that the devices were legal and not regulated under U.S. firearms laws. Such a move could have removed some of the political liabilities involved with asking lawmakers to impose new gun controls.  But neither the design of the bump stock nor gun laws have changed since ATF issued its original finding, making it legally problematic and politically untenable for the agency to reverse course.  And it was not immediately clear whether President Donald Trump or Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who oversees the firearms agency, could order it to re-evaluate its 2010 judgment about bump stock devices.  Congressman John Lewis joined fellow Democratic representatives outside the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday to call for action on gun legislation. He indicated Republicans were not focusing on the issue at hand after the deadly Las Vegas shooting. (Oct. 4)  The accessories fit over the stock and grip of a semi-automatic rifle and allow the weapon to fire continuously, some 400 to 800 rounds in a single minute. Bump stocks were found among the gunman’s weapons and explain why victims in Las Vegas heard what sounded like automatic-weapons fire as the shooter rained bullets from a casino high-rise, slaughtering 58 people in a concert below and wounding hundreds more.  Sudden endorsements of controls came almost simultaneously from the NRA and the White House.  The NRA, which famously opposes virtually any hint of new restrictions called on ATF “to immediately review whether these devices comply with federal law. The NRA believes that devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations.”  Moments after, at the White House, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders praised the announcement. House Speaker Paul Ryan added his support, as have other top Republicans.  But even with the unusual concession, it is extremely rare that the ATF would reconsider its previous evaluations unless federal law changes. That could be seen as an admission that its earlier evaluation was legally flawed.  The ATF provides the guidance when a manufacturer asks the agency to evaluate a firearm or accessory to determine if it can be sold or if its sale is restricted by either the Gun Control Act or the National Firearms Act.  Changes to existing law or new laws can prompt the agency to reclassify an item, as can alterations to the device or weapon.  The ATF stressed that its classification is specific to each item submitted. And it is based on the most current laws on the books at the time, as well as on a physical examination of the item.  The nation’s largest gun lobby and most Republicans have stood firmly in recent years against stricter gun regulations, even as one mass shooting after another horrified the nation. Even gunfire that left House Majority Whip Steve Scalise near death at a baseball practice earlier this year didn’t change the equation.  But this time, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, combined with the opportunity to back a limited change that could potentially be accomplished administratively, spurred a shift.  The device, which retails for around $200, is not known among gun dealers as an item that is hugely popular. It causes the gun to buck back and forth, repeatedly “bumping” the trigger against the shooter’s finger. Technically, that means the finger is pulling the trigger for each round fired, keeping the weapon a legal semi-automatic. Because it creates a significant rocking motion it also means that the gun is “spraying” bullets and it’s difficult to hit a target.  ___  Associated Press writers Lisa Marie Pane in Atlanta and Sadie Gurman in Washington contributed to this report.",5.0,1,[5.0]
308,1643,10,6,2017,2017-10-06,Associated Press News,US Customs vows to block imports made by North Korea workers,"North Korean workers walk in a group to dormitories in the compound of the seafood processing factory Hunchun Pagoda in the city of Hunchun in northeastern China's Jilin province. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)  U.S. Customs and Border Protection says it is ready to block U.S. imports of seafood — as well as any other goods — produced by North Korean laborers who work in China.  An Associated Press investigation tracked salmon, squid and cod processed by North Koreans working at Chinese factories and shipped to American stores, including Walmart and ALDI. The North Korean workers found in Chinese factories aren’t allowed to leave, and receive only a fraction of their pay — most goes straight to the North Korean state. This means that American consumers buying seafood labeled “Caught in the USA, Processed in China” may inadvertently be subsidizing the government of Kim Jong Un as it builds nuclear weapons, and also supporting forced labor.  U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it is reviewing the allegations and if warranted, would “pursue all enforcement actions and prohibit goods from importation as appropriate.” The companies that responded also vowed to investigate ties with suppliers.  At this point anything made by North Korean workers anywhere is presumed to be made with forced labor, the State Department said in a statement Friday.  If you buy salmon from Walmart or ALDI, you may inadvertently have subsidized the North Korean government as it builds its nuclear weapons program, an AP investigation has found. (Oct. 4)  “North Koreans sent overseas do not have a choice in the work; the government ultimately assigns them and they are not free to change jobs,” said the statement, noting that wages and passports are typically withheld by North Korean supervisors.  GOP Congressman Chris Smith from New Jersey, who has repeatedly called for tougher enforcement, said the Labor Department has already identified trafficking in 12 sectors of goods exported by China.  “CBP should be stopping every shipment from those sectors — and now trafficking-tainted salmon too,” he said.  A White House National Security Council spokesman said the North Korean government’s scheme to outsource its labor underscores why the United States has pushed for restrictions on North Korean foreign workers. The spokesman said all countries should, at a minimum, ban companies from bringing in North Korean crews, as pledged in recent United Nations sanctions.  China is among the countries that have promised to comply, already banning imports of North Korean seafood, and saying no more North Korean workers will be allowed starting next year.  “But all nations must go further and reject what is clearly a despicable practice that only serves the regime’s nuclear ambitions,” said the NSC spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to comment.  Walmart said its supplier has addressed the problem, although it did not specify how. Walmart and ALDI said they are committed to human rights and fair labor practices, and expect the same from their business partners.  At a time when North Korea faces sanctions on many exports, the government is sending tens of thousands of workers worldwide, bringing in revenue estimated at anywhere from $200 million to $500 million a year. That could account for a sizable portion of North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile programs, which South Korea says have cost more than $1 billion.  North Koreans overseas work in construction in the Gulf states, shipbuilding in Poland, logging in Russia. In Uruguay, authorities told AP, about 90 North Koreans crewed fishing boats last year.  “I am not surprised at all,” said Anthony Talbott, who directs the University of Dayton’s Human Rights Center. “North Korea has probably the single highest level of state-sanctioned slavery in the world, it’s a major source of income for them.”  Among those North Korean laborers in China, roughly 3,000 are believed to work in the northeast industrial hub of Hunchun, just a few miles from the borders of both North Korea and Russia. AP documented North Koreans in several Hunchun seafood processing plants, and tracked their supply chains to importers, including Sea-Trek Enterprises in Rhode Island, where managers said they are being inundated with phone calls from customers and suppliers since the AP story.  Sea-Trek’s owners said that they hadn’t visited China and were unaware of the makeup of the workers, but would immediately cease dealings with the plant until the situation is resolved.  “Sea-Trek will not purchase product from any company using forced labor,” said vice president Mitch Sarnoff.  Mark Liszt, owner of Lawrence Wholesale, a national food distributor in Southern California, said it would investigate its suppliers as well.  “We’re middlemen,” said Liszt. “We do make a practice of trying to go and visit the plants that we buy from in person, but it’s not a perfect world that we can see into every single one.”  Some U.S. brands and companies had indirect ties to the North Korean laborers in Hunchun, including Chicken of the Sea, owned by Thai Union. Trade records show shipments came from a sister company of the Hunchun factory in another part of China, where Thai Union spokeswoman Whitney Small says labor standards are being met and the employees are all Chinese. Small said the sister company should not be penalized.  AP observed North Korean workers in Chinese factories building hardwood flooring, sewing garments and manufacturing electronics. Fordham University economics professor Giacomo Santangelo said he doubts it’s just fish processed by North Korean workers that reaches the U.S. markets.  “Now we need to ask, how many other products imported from China are made with North Korean labor?” he said.  Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York said U.S. officials must keep products made by North Koreans out of the United States.  “The administration needs to ramp up the pressure on China to crack down on trade with North Korea across the board,” he said.  Ohio’s Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, who helped pass North Korea, Iran and Russia sanctions this summer, said corporations also have a responsibility to make sure they are abiding by U.N. sanctions and U.S. laws.  However, Bucknell University political science professor Zhiqun Zhu said a sanction-based approach that cracks down on imports isn’t going to solve the problem.  “It has so many loopholes,” he said. “All sticks and no carrots will not make the North Korea problem disappear.”  ___  Read earlier story in seafood investigation — http://bit.ly/2kof26j — and more in the series: https://www.apnews.com/tag/RepublicofKim",5.0,1,[5.0]

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)  WASHINGTON (AP) — The National Rifle Association joined the Trump administration and top congressional Republicans Thursday in a swift and surprising embrace of a restriction on Americans’ guns, though a narrow one: to regulate the “bump stock” devices the Las Vegas shooter apparently used to horrifically lethal effect.  The devices, originally intended to help people with disabilities, fit over the stock and grip of a semi-automatic rifle and allow the weapon to fire continuously, some 400 to 800 rounds in a single minute.

He indicated Republicans were not focusing on the issue at hand after the deadly Las Vegas shooting. (Oct. 4)  Moments after, at the White House, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders praised the announcement.  “We welcome that and a conversation on that,” Sanders said. “It’s something we’re very open to.”  House Speaker Paul Ryan added his support, as have other top Republicans.  “Obviously we need to look at how we can tighten up the compliance with this law so that fully automatic weapons are banned,” the Wisconsin Republican told reporters at an event in Chestertown, Maryland.  It was a rare concession for all concerned. The nation’s largest gun lobby and most Republicans have stood firmly in recent years against stricter gun regulations, even as one mass shooting after another horrified the nation. They blocked background check legislation after the shooting deaths of elementary school children in Connecticut in 2012, and took no action despite intense pressure from Democrats, including a House floor sit-in, after last year’s bloodbath at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Even gunfire that left House Majority Whip Steve Scalise near death at a baseball practice earlier this year didn’t change the equation.  But this time, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, combined with the opportunity to back a limited change that could potentially be accomplished administratively, spurred a shift.  Robert Spitzer, chairman of the political science department at SUNY Cortland, who watches the gun industry closely, said he was surprised.  Still, he said, “it’s a pretty small concession in the realm of gun stuff. We’re not talking about banning assault weapons here. It’s a very specific accessory.”  The device, which retails for around $200, is not known among gun dealers as an item that is hugely popular. It was created ostensibly to help people with disabilities more easily fire AK- and AR-platform long guns.  The device causes the gun to buck back and forth, repeatedly “bumping” the trigger against the shooter’s finger. Technically, that means the finger is pulling the trigger for each round fired, keeping the weapon a legal semi-automatic. Because it creates a significant rocking motion it also means that the gun is “spraying” bullets and it’s difficult to hit a target.  The stocks have been around for less than a decade. Many Capitol Hill Republicans said this week they had never even heard of them before the shooting in Las Vegas. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms during the Obama administration gave its seal of approval to their sale in 2010 after concluding that they did not violate federal law.  Now, some Republicans appear inclined to blame the Obama administration for allowing their use in the first place.  “We have to get more education on what they are,” Ryan said. “Was it a regulatory misstep by ATF some years ago?”  The issue of bump stocks came up aboard Air Force One as President Donald Trump traveled back from visiting Las Vegas on Wednesday, according to GOP Rep. Mark Amodei of Nevada, who was on board and said Trump sounded open to a change.  But Democrats insisted that a regulatory change by the ATF would not be sufficient.  “Federal regulations won’t be able to fully close this loophole,” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, who introduced a bill this week to ban the devices. “Legislation would make crystal clear that Congress is banning all devices that allow a weapon to achieve an automatic rate of fire, regardless of how a weapon is altered.”  It was uncertain whether Congress would go that far.  At the same time, the attention on the devices was already causing an industry response. Slide Fire, the leading maker of bump stocks, suspended sales of the items. In a post on its website, the company said it was not taking any new orders “to provide the best service with those already placed.”  ___  Associated Press writer Lisa Marie Pane contributed from Atlanta.",4.0,1,[4.0]
310,1645,10,5,2017,2017-10-05,Associated Press News,Equifax makes money by knowing a lot about you," This Saturday, July 21, 2012, file photo shows the corporate headquarters of Equifax Inc. in Atlanta. Equifax knows a lot about you. That, in essence, is how it makes money. The company and its competitors, Experian and TransUnion, make most of their money selling bulk lists to banks and credit card companies. (AP Photo/Mike Stewart, File)  NEW YORK (AP) — Equifax knows a lot about you. That is, in essence, how it makes money.  The company and its competitors have in their files the personal financial information of tens of millions of Americans like you, going back decades. Your mortgage loan totals. When you switched from a Macy’s card to a Target card. How much you still owe for college.  “It’s a pretty simple business model, actually. They gather as much information about you from lenders, aggregate it, and sell it back to them,” said Brett Horn, an industry analyst with Morningstar.  Equifax had more than $3.1 billion in revenue last year, largely from selling data to other companies. Experian’s revenue came to $4.34 billion, while TransUnion had $1.7 billion.  The trove of data — Equifax’s largest asset — has become its biggest liability after the company admitted that it didn’t keep the information safe from criminals who stole or accessed the data on 143 million Americans who are now at risk for identity theft. It’s now under investigation at the state and federal level, facing a series of lawsuits, and desperately trying to assuage the anger of the consumers who are its commodities.  What to know about how the credit companies work:  WHERE THE MONEY COMES FROM  Equifax, Experian and TransUnion make most of their money selling bulk lists to banks and credit card companies.  American Express, for example, could purchase a list of potential customers 25 to 30 years old with credit scores above 650. Armed with that, AmEx will send out pre-approved credit card mailers, hoping to sign up new customers.  Hundreds of millions of credit reports are sold this way each year to companies like Capital One, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup. Since the banks buy the reports in bulk, they pay as little as a few dollars per report. While people can get their credit reports once a year for free, Equifax charges $15.95 for the report plus a credit score, while Experian charges $19.95 for a report and score.  The credit bureaus also sell credit reports to potential employers. About 45 percent of companies with 2,500 to 24,999 employees do background credit checks on some job applicants, according to a 2012 study by the Society for Human Resource Management. While employers cannot get a person’s credit score, they can discover legal judgments or bankruptcies.  And there are products like fraud protection services and credit monitoring. Equifax normally sells a package of credit monitoring services for $19.95 a month. Experian is more involved in that market, but has gotten into some hot water. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau fined Experian $3 million in March for selling misleading credit scores to consumers.  Critics of the credit companies argue that Equifax could make some money off its own security failings. Its TrustedID product, which it is offering free for a year to people whose information was exposed, could retain some customers. LifeLock, another identity theft product, has also seen increased interest since the breach — but it buys its protection services from Equifax.  Finally, the company charges fees to customers who want to freeze or unfreeze their credit files. Those fees vary by state, and Equifax has waived them in the wake of the data breach.  HOW THE CIRCLE WORKS  The credit companies get information, such as whether you’ve paid your bills on time each month, largely for free.  An estimated 10,000 different companies and sources report information about you to Equifax, TransUnion and Experian, according to a 2012 study by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Industry experts say that figure could be as high as 30,000.  That information gets compiled into your individual credit report, pooled with data from banks to build a comprehensive picture of your financial history, and your potential financial risk.  Banks are just as reliant on the credit companies. Without the credit reports, a customer could default on a loan, then apply for another elsewhere without the new bank knowing the person’s history. The U.S. has thousands of individual lenders and banks, so very rarely could one bank offer a complete picture of a person’s financial history.  Often, banks make credit decisions based almost entirely on what they see in a credit report from these companies.  “They are the gatekeepers to whether you can get a credit card or an affordable car loan or a house,” said Chi Chi Wu, a longtime critic of the credit-reporting industry and a lawyer at the National Consumer Law Center.  THE ORIGIN OF CREDIT COMPANIES  Equifax, TransUnion and Experian are often referred to as credit bureaus or agencies, which lends them an official air. But they’re private companies without government affiliation.  How the companies got to hold information on so many millions of people in the first place is largely due to their position in a lightly regulated part of the U.S. financial system. The credit companies are governed by one main federal law, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which requires the companies to give you access to your data once a year and allow for disputes. Most of the regulation in the industry happens at the state level.  It’s also incredibly difficult to opt out of the system. You could live an all-cash lifestyle, never requesting credit from any bank, but still wind up with your information in the hands of the credit companies through less-obvious sources like cable or phone companies, property tax bills, or doctors’ offices.  Customers like this are known as “thin file” borrowers, because of the lack of information, but that doesn’t stop Equifax, Experian and TransUnion from building files on you. In these cases, the companies might only have a name, address, maybe a Social Security number — but that data could still be enough to start the process of identity theft.  ____  Ken Sweet covers banks and consumer financial issues for The Associated Press.

Pat Toomey, R-Pa., as the Senate Budget Committee votes on amendments during the markup of Senate's fiscal year 2018 budget resolution, on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, Oct. 5, 2017. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)  WASHINGTON (AP) — The House has passed a $4.1 trillion budget plan that promises deep cuts to social programs while paving the way for Republicans to rewrite the tax code later this year.  The 2018 House GOP budget reprises a controversial plan to turn Medicare into a voucher-like program for future retirees as well as the party’s efforts to repeal the “Obamacare” health law. Republicans controlling Congress have no plans to actually implement those cuts while they pursue their tax overhaul.  That’s especially so in the Senate, where the Budget Committee on Thursday gave party-line approval to a companion plan.  Instead, the nonbinding budget’s chief purpose is to set the stage for a tax overhaul plan that is the party’s top political priority as well as a longtime policy dream of key leaders like Speaker Paul Ryan.  The White House issued a statement saying the House plan is a key step toward “Making America Great Again.”  The House measure, passed by a near party-line vote of 219-206, calls for more than $5 trillion in spending cuts over the coming decade, promising to slash Medicaid by about $1 trillion over the next 10 years, cutting other health care costs, and forcing huge cuts to domestic programs funded in future years by Congress.  “It’s a budget that will help grow our economy, and it’s a budget that will help rein in our debt,” said Ryan, R-Wis. “It reforms Medicaid. It strengthens Medicare.”  But Republicans are not actually planning to impose any of those cuts with follow-up legislation that would be required under Washington’s Byzantine budget rules. Instead, those GOP proposals for spending cuts are limited to nonbinding promises, and even a token 10-year, $200 billion spending cut package demanded by tea party House Republicans appears likely to be scrapped in upcoming talks with the Senate.  Instead, the motivating force behind the budget measures is the Republicans’ party-defining drive to cut corporate and individual tax rates and rid the tax code of loopholes. They promise this tax “reform” measure will put the economy in overdrive, driving economic growth to the 3 percent range, and adding a surge of new tax revenues.  “In order to pay for these huge tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires, this Republican budget makes savage cuts to the life and death programs that mean so much to ordinary Americans,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.  Passing the measure in the House and Senate would provide key procedural help for the tax measure because it sets the stage for follow-on legislation that can’t be filibustered by Senate Democrats. Republicans used the same so-called reconciliation procedure in their failed attempt to kill “Obamacare,” including its tax surcharges on wealthy people.  “Through reconciliation, our budget specifically paves the way for pro-growth tax reform that will reduce taxes for middle-class Americans and free up American businesses to grow and hire,” said Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn., who chairs the House Budget Committee.  Eighteen Republicans opposed the measure, including several from high-tax states like New York and New Jersey who are concerned that the upcoming tax effort would repeal the deductions for state and local taxes.  Democrats blasted the sweeping spending cuts proposed by Republicans — more than $5 trillion over 10 years in the House plan and somewhat less in the Senate GOP measure — as an assault on middle-class families and the poor.  “Is it a statement of our values to take a half-trillion dollars out of Medicare to give a tax cut to the wealthiest people in our country?” said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.  The Senate Budget Committee’s companion plan approved Thursday differs in key details — but would still result in a deficit of $424 billion in 2027, according to the Congressional Budget Office.  The House measure assumes the upcoming tax bill won’t add to the deficit; the Senate version, however, would permit the measure to add $1.5 trillion to the $20 trillion-plus national debt over the coming 10 years. The final version is likely to stick closely to the Senate measure in key respects. A final House-Senate agreement won’t come until November, Black said, but she anticipated conflict over the Senate plans.  “That is certainly going to be a very lively discussion,” Black said of House-Senate talks. “Our members are concerned about (budget) balance and they’re also concerned about the debt and deficits.”  The real-world trajectory of Washington, however, is for higher deficits as Republicans focus on tax cuts, a huge hike in the defense budget, and a growing disaster aid tally that is about to hit $45 billion.  “The train’s left the station, and if you’re a budget hawk, you were left at the station,” said Rep.

On Thursday, Oct. 5, 2017, Netflix announced it is raising the price for its most popular U.S. video streaming plan by 10 percent in a move that may boost its profits, but slow the subscriber growth that drives its stock price. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke)  SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Netflix is raising the price for its most popular U.S. video streaming plan by 10 percent — a move aimed at bringing in more money to outbid HBO, Amazon and other rivals for addictive shows such as “Stranger Things.”  The change announced Thursday affects most of Netflix’s 53 million U.S. subscribers.  WHAT GOES UP  Netflix will now charge $11 per month instead of $10 for a plan that includes HD and allows people to simultaneously watch programs on two different internet-connected devices.  The price for another plan that includes ultra-high definition, or 4K, video, is going up by 17 percent, to $14 from $12 a month. A plan that limits subscribers to one screen at a time without high-definition will remain at $8 a month.  The increase will be the first in two years for Netflix, although it won’t seem that way for millions of subscribers. That’s because Netflix temporarily froze its rates for long-time subscribers the last two times it raised its prices, delaying the most recent increases until the second half of last year for them.  Netflix isn’t giving anyone a break this time around. It will start emailing notifications about the new prices to affected subscribers Oct. 19, giving them 30 days to accept the higher rates, switch to a cheaper plan or cancel the service.  WHY PRICES ARE RISING  The price increase are being driven by Netflix’s desire to boost its profits as it spends more money to finance a critically acclaimed slate of original programming that includes shows such as “House of Cards,” ″Orange Is The New Black,” and “The Crown,” in addition to “Stranger Things.”  Those series’ success helped Netflix land more Emmy award nominations than any TV network besides HBO this year. It’s also the main reason Netflix’s U.S. audience has nearly doubled since the February 2013 debut of “House of Cards” kicked off its expansion into original programming.  But paying for exclusive TV series and films hasn’t been cheap. Netflix expects to spend $6 billion a year alone on programming this year, and the expenses are likely to rise as it competes against streaming rivals such as Amazon, Hulu, YouTube and, potentially, Apple for the rights to future shows and movies.  Amazon (at $99 per year, or about $8.25 per month) offers a lower price than Netflix’s while Hulu’s monthly fee ranges from $8 for a plan with commercials to $11 for a commercial-free plan.  POSSIBILITY OF BACKLASH  Netflix believes its price rate is justified by recent service improvements, such as a feature that allows people to download shows onto phones or other devices to watch them offline.  RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney believes Netflix’s programming line-up is so compelling that the service could charge even higher prices and still retain most of its audience. He predicted the upcoming price increase will generate an additional $650 million in revenue next year.  But Netflix subscribers have rebelled against price increases in the past, most notably in 2011 when the company stopped bundling its streaming service with its DVD-by-mail service, resulting in price increases of as much as 60 percent for customers who wanted both plans. Netflix lost 600,000 subscribers and its stock price plummeted by 80 percent in the subsequent backlash. The company rebounded strongly, though, propelling its stock from a split-adjusted low of $7.54 in 2012 to $194.39 Thursday after investors reacted positively to the higher prices, driving up the shares by 5 percent.  And Netflix blamed a temporary slowdown in subscriber growth last year on the lifting of its price freeze on long-time customers who decided to drop the service rather than pay slightly more money.  Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter believes less than 10 percent of current subscribers will cancel Netflix as prices rise again, but he predicts it will be tougher to attract new customers who will choose Amazon’s cheaper alternative.  ___  This story has been corrected from an earlier version to reflect that Hulu charges $8 to $11 per month for its streaming service, not $10.

Researchers in Massachusetts say great white sharks in the Atlantic Ocean are venturing offshore farther, with more frequency and at greater depths than previously known. The findings were published Sept. 29, 2017, in the scientific journal Marine Ecology Progress Series. (AP Photo/Stephan Savoia, File)  BOSTON (AP) — The movements of great white sharks in the Pacific and Indian oceans have long been the subject of academic study, but new research is just starting to shed light on the behavior of their Atlantic Ocean counterparts.  Researchers in Massachusetts say white sharks appear to venture offshore farther, with more frequency and at greater depths than previously known in the Atlantic.  Some of the 32 sharks tracked between 2009 and 2014 ended up as far east as the Azores, the Portuguese island chain located more than 2,300 miles (3,701 kilometers) from Cape Cod, where most of the animals were initially outfitted with satellite tags.  They also were found to make frequent deep dives — as far down as 3,700 feet (1,127 meters) — and spend more time at those dark depths than previous studies in the Atlantic suggest.  The team, which included scientists from the state Division of Marine Fisheries, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, had its findings published last week in Marine Ecology Progress Series, a prominent scientific journal.  “Everything we knew previously indicated that the white shark in the Atlantic is more coastally-oriented, moving north-to-south and remaining on the continental shelf,” explained Gregory Skomal, the study’s lead author. “So what we’re now describing is this other component, this offshore movement into open ocean.”  Skomal says the work has implications for shark conservation efforts since it extends the known habitat for these ancient predators. White sharks are not considered endangered or threatened, but it’s illegal to hunt them in U.S. waters.  “You’ve got U.S. protection within 200 miles of shore, but you have sharks clearly leaving that protection that are vulnerable to harvest,” Skomal said. “We need to engage other countries fishing in these waters to talk about putting similar protections in place.”  The research is exciting because it represents the “first real insights into the movement patterns of white sharks” in the northern part of the Atlantic, says Tobey Curtis, a Massachusetts-based shark researcher for the National Marine Fisheries Service who was not involved with the study.  “Prior to this, we were only able to piece together information about their distribution from widely scattered reports from fishermen, scientists and the public,” he said. “Having tracks of individual sharks really helps fill in the gaps, and provides a more complete picture of white shark movements and migrations.”  The study seems to hew closely to what’s been observed of white sharks in other oceans — that juveniles tend to stay in the relatively shallower waters of the continental shelf where food sources abound, while adults are more apt to venture into open ocean, observes Christopher Lowe, a shark researcher at California State University in Long Beach also not involved with the research.  Indeed, most of the tagged sharks in the Atlantic study generally followed a north-south migration along the Eastern Seaboard.  They headed to Newfoundland and New England waters in the summer, then down south to the Carolinas and even the Bahamas for the winter.  Lowe says it remains to be seen what impact continued growth of white shark populations in the Atlantic has on these habits, or whether climate change is playing a role.  Another key question is finding out what these sharks are actually doing so far offshore.  Researchers in northern California suggest offshore movements are for mating, a ritual that has never been observed among white sharks. But Skomal and his team believe the animals are more likely foraging — it’s just not immediately obvious what they’re feeding on.  “That’s the great mystery right now,” he said.  ___  Follow Philip Marcelo at twitter.com/philmarcelo.

314,1649,10,5,2017,2017-10-05,Associated Press News,Science Says: Era of monster hurricanes roiling the Atlantic," It’s not just this year. The monster hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, Jose and Lee that have raged across the Atlantic are contributing to what appears to be the most active period for major storms on record.  And the busiest part of hurricane season isn’t even over.  An analysis of 167 years of federal storm data by The Associated Press found that no 30-year period in history has seen this many major hurricanes, this many days of those whoppers spinning in the Atlantic, or this much overall energy generated by those powerful storms.  The following message will be displayed to users with unsupported browsers: Your browser does not support the iframe HTML tag. Try viewing this in a modern browser like Chrome, Safari, Firefox or Internet Explorer 9 or later. Scientists use a measure called Accumulated Cyclone Energy, or ACE, that factors in wind speed and storm duration to gauge hurricane power. This year is one of the highest compared to other years, but not the highest. There are two months left in the hurricane season.  Scientists caution it is too soon to draw conclusions from the data, and they don’t say the intense activity confirms a trend. Storms in the distant past may have gone unnoticed, which could make earlier generations appear quieter than they were. Some scientists say past hurricane data is so weak that it’s impossible to connect the recent activity to global warming.  But more intense storms are what scientists expect to see as the planet’s climate changes because warmer ocean water is fuel for hurricanes. And they say it is important to better understand this current intense period to save lives and prevent worse future destruction.  Georgia Tech climate scientist Kim Cobb said it would be “foolish” for policymakers to ignore the data. “We may not have as much data as we would like, but we have enough to aggressively invest in a variety of defenses for coastal communities,” she said in an email. “We face a triple threat of rising seas, stronger winds, and literally off-the-charts rainfall totals.”  The Atlantic hurricane season was more intense than normal in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2016. The 2005 season, which included Katrina, Rita and Wilma, was so active forecasters ran out of names for storms.  Then came this year. Fueled by warmer than normal ocean temperatures and ideal wind conditions, September 2017 had more days with major hurricanes spinning and more overall hurricane energy expelled than any month on record, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach. Harvey spawned record rainfall. Irma had record high winds in the open Atlantic. And Maria hit the U.S. stronger than the earlier two.  The Associated Press looked at all major hurricanes — not just the small fraction that hit the U.S. — and grouped them into 30-year periods to mirror the 30-year cycles climate scientists use to understand how the climate is changing. The analysis found that in the period from 1988 to 2017:  — There have been 90 major hurricanes, an average of three a year. That’s 48 percent more than during the previous 30 years. This hurricane season is at five and still counting.  — During the past 30 years major hurricanes have churned for an average of 7.2 days. That’s 65 percent more than the average during the previous 30 years. There have been 18.8 major hurricane days so far this year.

The annual average ACE of the past 30 years is 41 percent more than in the previous 30 years. An average year ACE is just shy of 100 and this year’s ACE, with two months still to go, is 204.2.

Try viewing this in a modern browser like Chrome, Safari, Firefox or Internet Explorer 9 or later. The storm energy generated since 1988 is 41 percent higher than in the previous 30 years.  — Of the last 30 years, nine hurricane seasons were considered “hyperactive” according to the definition used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and seven were above normal. Only seven years were below normal.  Was it just as busy for major storms in the 1930s or 1890s? The numbers say no, but scientists won’t draw conclusions because they fear a large undercount of storms before the 1960s.  “There’s no question that the storms are stronger than they were 30 years ago,” said NOAA climate and hurricane scientist James Kossin. “The questions are if you go back a little further if that’s what you’ll find. We do know for sure that things have increased a hell of a lot since 1970.”  So what’s going on?  Scientists talk about two important factors for long-term hurricane activity: man-made climate change and a natural pattern of changes in the Atlantic.  The world’s oceans go through long cycles as water circulates like a giant conveyor belt. They last 20 to 30 years, carrying water with different levels of salt and temperature. That cycle seems coincide with hurricane activity, Klotzbach said.  Klotzbach predicts that a period of high salinity and warmer water in the North Atlantic that has been present since 1995 will soon fade — and take with it this ultra-busy period for storms. Other scientists dispute this.  More frequent and more intense storms fit what scientists expect to see accompany global warming, MIT hurricane and climate professor Kerry Emanuel said. Physics, computer simulations and numerous scientific studies show that as the world warms the strongest storms should get wetter and more intense, and probably more frequent. Yet, the overall number of all named storms is likely to drop because there will likely be fewer weaker ones, scientists say.  Still, scientists say it would take more years — and maybe decades — of good data to know for sure if there’s a direct connection to climate change.  National Hurricane Center science officer Chris Landsea said the problems with missing past storms are so severe “making any conclusions for the entire (Atlantic) basin would not be justified” and several other scientists agreed with him.  Climate scientist Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute in Germany said the data showing increased intensity is clear enough for him: “The only caveat being that the increase might be exaggerated somewhat because of undercounting early storms.”  What’s happening with hurricanes — the frequency, the duration, and the energy — is probably a combination of factors caused by both nature and man, Klotzbach said: “a mish-mosh of everything.”  ___  AP data journalist Nicky Forster contributed to this story from New York.  ___  Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears .

343,1684,10,6,2017,2017-10-06,Associated Press News,Review of Dakota Access oil pipeline to extend into spring," It probably will take until next spring for the Army Corps of Engineers to finish court-ordered additional environmental study of the Dakota Access oil pipeline, agency attorneys said in court documents filed Friday.  The Corps had anticipated completing the task by the end of the year, but Justice Department attorney Matthew Marinelli said it will take longer than expected to get needed information including spill modeling from Texas-based pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners and possibly from at least one unspecified American Indian tribe.  “Given the current expected time frame for the receipt of additional information, the Corps now anticipates that its review and analysis ... will not conclude until approximately April 2, 2018,” Marinelli wrote.  The $3.8 billion pipeline began carrying oil from North Dakota through South Dakota and Iowa to a distribution point in Illinois on June 1. However, four Sioux tribes in the Dakotas continue challenging it in federal court in Washington, D.C., because they fear a leak could contaminate their water supply. The pipeline crosses beneath the Lake Oahe reservoir on the Missouri River just to the north of the Standing Rock Reservation that straddles the North Dakota-South Dakota border.  “The notice says they are conducting additional oil spill modeling —in other words, this wasn’t done before the Trump administration approved (the pipeline),” tribal Chairman Dave Archambault said Friday in a statement to The Associated Press. “This confirms what we’ve been saying from the start — until there’s been a full analysis of risks and impacts to the Standing Rock tribe, the pipeline should be shut down.”  U.S. District Judge James Boasberg is considering halting pipeline operations while the additional study is done. It’s not known when he’ll rule.  Boasberg ruled on June 14 that the Corps largely complied with environmental law in giving its permission for the pipeline project, but that it didn’t adequately consider how an oil spill under Lake Oahe might affect the Standing Rock tribe. He also said the Corps didn’t adequately study how the pipeline might disproportionately affect the tribal community — a concept known as environmental justice. That aims to ensure development projects aren’t built in areas where minority populations might not have the resources to defend their rights. Boasberg ordered the Corps to reconsider those issues.  The Corps is “actively working on ways to shorten” the new April timeline for completing the work, Marinelli said.  ___  Follow Blake Nicholson on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/NicholsonBlake",4.333333333333333,3,"[4.5, 5.0, 3.5]"

Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Va. The National Space Council, chaired by Pence, heard testimony from representatives from civil space, commercial space, and national security space industry representatives. (Joel Kowsky/NASA via AP)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Seated before the grounded space shuttle Discovery, a constellation of Trump administration officials used soaring rhetoric to vow to send Americans back to the moon and then on to Mars.  After voicing celestial aspirations, top officials moved to what National Intelligence Director Dan Coats called “a dark side” to space policy. Coats, Vice President Mike Pence, other top officials and outside space experts said the United States has to counter and perhaps match potential enemies’ ability to target U.S. satellites.  Pence, several cabinet secretaries and White House advisers gathered in the shadow of the shuttle at the Smithsonian Institution’s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center to chart a new path in space — government, commercial and military — for the country. It was the first meeting of the National Space Council, revived after it was disbanded in 1993.  But details, such as how much the new ideas will cost, were scant and outside experts said they’ve heard grandiose plans before only to see them fizzle instead of launch.  “We will return American astronauts to the moon, not only to leave behind footprints and flags, but to build the foundation we need to send Americans to Mars and beyond,” Pence said.  Vice President Mike Pence kicked off the first meeting of the National Space Council Thursday by saying that ""America seems to have lost our edge in space, but those days are over."" (Oct. 5)  Space industry leaders say they and NASA are building the spaceships to get there. And they’re promising that in five years, astronauts could be working around the moon.  David Thompson, president of the space company Orbital ATK, said NASA’s Orion capsule and super-sized Space Launch System rocket should be ready in a couple years, so flying around the moon and even making a lunar orbiting outpost is within reach. But he said a lunar landing would take longer. Blue Origin rocket company chief executive officer Bob Smith said his firm could have a lunar lander program ready within five years.  No humans have been on the moon since Apollo 17 in December 1972. Only 12 men have set foot on the moon, all have been Americans.  Past presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush proposed returns to the moon and then going on to Mars. Barack Obama rerouted the moon plan to an asteroid as a first-stop with Mars as the goal. All plans had lack of money keep them from coming true, said space expert Brian Weeden of the Secure World Foundation. He wasn’t part of the council meeting.  “Is it going to happen? Who knows? I feel like I’ve been disappointed so many times I refuse to get excited,” said Roger Launius, a longtime space historian.  And Gwynn Shotwell, president of SpaceX, said her company next year will launch astronauts to the International Space Station, the first American launch of people since 2011. After the 2003 space shuttle Columbia broke apart on descent, then-president George W. Bush announced the phasing out of the space shuttle program. Eventually, NASA started building new multibillion dollar ships, the Orion capsule and the SLS mega-rocket.  Pence several times bemoaned a U.S. space program that had fallen behind, asking space executives what they thought.  “America is out-innovating the world in space launch,” Shotwell said, noting that her company had launched 13 rockets this year, more than any other nation.  After talking about how “we will blaze new trails into that great frontier” Pence turned the discussion to the dangers of space and how much of the U.S. intelligence system and day-to-day life are dependent on commercial satellites operating safely. And he and others outlined threats to those satellites from potential enemies that could cripple American security and daily life.  Experts worried that satellites could be destroyed and debris in orbit could ruin others.  Pence asked if the U.S. should “weaponize” space.  “The choice whether or not to weaponize space is not one that we can make. We can only decide to match and raise our adversaries who are already weaponizing space,” former NASA chief Michael Griffin said. “That horse is already out of the barn.”  White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said the country needs to “deter and when necessary defeat adversaries’ counter-space efforts...

Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. walks to his seat as he attends a luncheon with other GOP Senators and President Donald Trump at the White House in Washington. Flake’s re-election race is becoming a case study in the GOP’s convulsions between the establishment, a furious base, and angry donors. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File)  PHOENIX (AP) — Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake’s re-election race is becoming a case study in the GOP’s convulsions among the establishment, a furious base and angry donors.  After bucking Donald Trump in a state the president won, Flake is bottoming out in polls. Yet Republicans look like they may be stuck with a hard-core conservative challenger who some fear could win the primary but lose in the general election.  A White House search for a candidate to replace former state Sen. Kelli Ward in the primary appears to have hit a wall. And now conservatives want to turn Arizona into the latest example of a Trump Train outsider taking down a member of the GOP establishment.  “People are fooling themselves if they think Jeff Flake is anything but a walking dead member of the United State Senate,” said Andy Surabian, whose Great America Alliance is backing Ward.  “I don’t see how he survives a primary. I don’t see how he survives a general. The numbers just don’t add up,” added Surabian, who worked at the White House as an adviser to Steve Bannon, then the president’s top strategist.  Despite discontent among some Republicans over Ward, Bannon met with her last week at a conservative conference in Colorado Springs to encourage her campaign, according to a Republican official who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose the previously unreported private meeting.  Ward unsuccessfully challenged Arizona’s senior senator, John McCain, in last year’s election, losing in the primary by a wide margin. But in Flake, she would face a more vulnerable candidate at a moment when the GOP establishment is on the defensive, facing a simmering anti-incumbent mood heightened by Republicans’ failure to make good on seven years of promises to scrap Barack Obama’s health care law.  Flake is in danger of becoming the latest victim of this voter wrath. Yet rather than making an effort to soothe pro-Trump GOP voters, he’s all but dared them to take him down by kicking off his campaign with an anti-Trump manifesto, “Conscience of a Conservative,” a book in which he bemoaned his party’s failure to stand up to Trump in last year’s presidential race.  “We pretended that the emperor wasn’t naked,” Flake wrote.  Trump, in turn, has lashed out at Flake on Twitter, calling him “toxic,” while praising Ward. White House officials say there’s little chance Trump will have a change of heart over supporting Flake. One official, speaking on condition of anonymity to disclose private deliberations, said Trump is irritated not only by Flake’s public criticism, but by what Trump sees as the senator’s attempts to use his critiques of the president to gain attention.  Nevertheless, Flake, 54, insists he won’t be getting out of the race. The primary is Aug. 29.  “We always knew we would have a tough primary. We always knew we would have a tough general,” Flake said in a brief interview at the Capitol. Asked about Trump’s opposition, Flake smiled and said, “There’s a long time between now and next August.”  Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has protected vulnerable GOP senators in the past, but his ability to do so in the future was thrown into question last month by Sen. Luther Strange’s loss to rabble-rousing Roy Moore in a runoff in Alabama. A McConnell-aligned super PAC had spent around $9 million to help Strange.  Trump was encouraged by McConnell and others to back Strange, a decision which he reportedly now regrets and which only added to the frictions between the president and the Senate leader. Flake’s candidacy could provide occasion for yet more conflict between the two, given the possibility that they will be on opposite sides in the primary.  Adding to Flake’s problems, donations to the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate GOP campaign arm, have dried up after the GOP failed to deliver on repealing and replacing the Obama health law. Some donors say they intend to withhold money from incumbent senators like Flake until they start delivering on Trump’s agenda, a strategy encouraged privately by some top White House officials.  “Donors are going to start cutting off funding for all senators until they get Trump’s initiatives passed,” said Roy Bailey, a Trump supporter and fundraiser in Texas. “I think there’s a real kind of movement going around that is catching momentum.”  Flake’s campaign points to strong fundraising numbers and upcoming events including a fundraising visit Monday by Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio. But Flake can’t even count on support from fellow members of his Arizona delegation. GOP Rep. Trent Franks demurred when asked if he would be supporting Flake for re-election  “I’m probably not going to, for a lot of reasons, not going to address that,” Franks said. “Obviously Sen. Flake knows how profoundly bewildered and disappointed I was with his actions that, in the general election last year, if everyone had followed that line of reasoning would have resulted in Hillary Clinton’s election.”  Franks’ name is one of several that have circulated as potential primary challengers to Flake, along with Rep. Paul Gosar, state university board member Jay Heiler and former state GOP Chairman Robert Graham. Several Republicans said the White House has been searching for some alternative to Ward.  Yet Ward shows no sign of stepping aside, and another consideration, usually unspoken, is McCain’s brain cancer which will likely mean another vacant Senate seat at some point in the future.  Ward’s erratic history, which causes mainline Republicans to view her as damaged goods, is underscored by comments she made after McCain’s July cancer diagnosis where she urged him to step down and suggested she should be considered to replace him.  “Look, you see what her numbers were in the McCain race - I don’t know what would make us think different now,” said Rep. David Schweikert, R-Ariz. Whichever Republican emerges from the primary will likely face Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, seen as a strong candidate.  It’s all adding to a season of trouble for GOP senators such as Flake and Dean Heller of Nevada, who also faces a primary challenge from the right. The good news for Senate Republicans, who hold a 52-48 majority, is that they have an extremely favorable map next year that has them defending only two genuinely endangered incumbents, Flake and Heller, while Democrats are on defense in 10 states Trump won.  ___  Werner reported from Washington.",4.625,4,"[4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.0]"

In June, 60 percent of Republicans said the country was headed in the right direction; now it’s just 44 percent.  The broader picture for the president is grim, too. Nearly 70 percent of Americans say Trump isn’t level-headed, and majorities say he’s not honest or a strong leader. More than 60 percent disapprove of how he is handling race relations, foreign policy and immigration, among other issues.  Overall, 67 percent of Americans disapprove of the job Trump is doing in office, including about one-third of Republicans.  Tracy Huelsman, a 40-year-old from Louisville, Kentucky, is among them. A self-described moderate Republican, Huelsman said she’s particularly concerned about the “divisiveness” she feels the president promotes on social media.  “It’s scary in 2017 that we are in what seems like a worse place in terms of division,” said Huelsman, who did not vote for Trump in last year’s election.  The assessments come after a turbulent summer for Trump that included a major White House shake-up, bringing the departure of his chief of staff, top strategist and press secretary. While the installment of retired Marine Gen. John Kelly as chief of staff has ushered in more day-to-day order in the West Wing, the president has still stirred up numerous controversies, including when he blamed “both sides” for the clashes between white supremacists and counter-protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia.  Trump has also raised the specter of a military conflict with North Korea over its nuclear provocations. He’s derided North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong Un, as “rocket man,” including during a speech at the United Nations, and has downplayed the prospects that diplomatic negotiations with Kim could yield results.  Despite his electoral success, Trump struggled as both a candidate and now as president to broaden his base of support beyond his ardent supporters. The loyalty of his core backers has been enough to keep Republican lawmakers largely in line, but party operatives are closely watching Trump’s support among GOP and independent voters ahead of next year’s midterm elections, when the balance of power in Congress will be at stake.  To be sure, lawmakers have their own problems to worry about. Americans have even less esteem for Congress than Trump, with just 18 percent saying they approve of the job being done by the House and the Senate.  Republicans took another hit last month when they failed — for a second time this year — to pass an overhaul of the nation’s health care law. GOP leaders tried to rush votes on the complicated legislation, leaving many voters unsure of what was in the package.  “They never seemed to present a bill to people that you could actually look at the details of and the pluses and minuses of it,” said Dennis Cronin, a 67-year-old independent from Wenham, Massachusetts.  The GOP failure on health care has irritated Trump, who promised voters that repealing “Obamacare” would be easy. Americans aren’t happy with his progress on health care either; 68 percent disapprove of his handling of the issue.  Of all the issues surveyed by the AP-NORC poll, the president performs slightly better on the economy. But even there, 56 percent disapprove of the job he’s doing and just 42 percent say they approve.  On Friday, the Labor Department announced that the U.S. shed 33,000 jobs in September because of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which closed thousands of businesses in Texas and Florida and forced widespread evacuations. It marked the first monthly hiring drop in nearly seven years.  Ninety-two percent of Democrats and 69 percent of independents say Trump understands the problems of people like them not very or not at all well. Even among Republicans, only 42 percent say he understands them very well, while 32 percent say he does moderately well.  The AP-NORC poll of 1,150 adults was conducted Sept. 28-Oct. 2 using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.  Respondents were first selected randomly using address-based sampling methods, and later interviewed online or by phone.  ___  Online:  AP-NORC Center: http://www.apnorc.org/  ___  Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC and Emily Swanson at http://twitter.com/el_swan",4.0,1,[4.0]

Trump is allowing more employers to opt out of providing no-cost birth control to women by claiming religious or moral objections, issuing new rules Friday that take another step in rolling back the Obama health care law. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)  WASHINGTON (AP) — In a one-two punch elating religious conservatives, President Donald Trump’s administration is allowing more employers to opt out of no-cost birth control for workers and issuing sweeping religious-freedom directions that could override many anti-discrimination protections for LGBT people and others.  At a time when Trump finds himself embattled on many fronts, the two directives — issued almost simultaneously on Friday — demonstrated the president’s eagerness to retain the loyalty of social conservatives who make up a key part of his base. Leaders of that constituency were exultant.  “President Trump is demonstrating his commitment to undoing the anti-faith policies of the previous administration and restoring true religious freedom,” said Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council.  Liberal advocacy groups, including those supporting LGBT and reproductive rights, were outraged.  “The Trump administration is saying to employers, ‘If you want to discriminate, we have your back,’” said Fatima Goss Graves, president of National Women’s Law Center.  Her organization is among several that are planning to challenge the birth-control rollback in court. The American Civil Liberties Union filed such a lawsuit less than three hours after the rules were issued.  “The Trump administration is forcing women to pay for their boss’ religious beliefs,” said ACLU senior staff attorney Brigitte Amiri. “We’re filing this lawsuit because the federal government cannot authorize discrimination against women in the name of religion or otherwise.”  The Democratic attorneys general of California and Massachusetts filed similar suits later Friday.  Both directives had been in the works for months, with activists on both sides of a culture war on edge about the timing and the details.  The religious-liberty directive, issued by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, instructs federal agencies to do as much as possible to accommodate those who claim their religious freedoms are being violated. The guidance effectively lifts a burden from religious objectors to prove that their beliefs about marriage or other topics that affect various actions are sincerely held.  “Except in the narrowest circumstances, no one should be forced to choose between living out his or her faith and complying with the law,” Sessions wrote.  In what is likely to be one of the more contested aspects of the document, the Justice Department states that religious organizations can hire workers based on religious beliefs and an employee’s willingness “to adhere to a code of conduct.” Many conservative Christian schools and faith-based agencies require employees to adhere to moral codes that ban sex outside marriage and same-sex relationships, among other behavior.  The Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian law firm, called it “a great day for religious freedom.” But JoDee Winterhof of the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBT-rights group, depicted the two directives as “an all-out assault, on women, LGBT people and others” as the administration fulfilled a “wish list” of the religious right.  The new policy on contraception, issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, allows more categories of employers, including publicly traded companies, to opt out of providing no-cost birth control to women by claiming religious or moral objections — another step in rolling back President Barack Obama’s health care law that required most companies to cover birth control at no additional cost.  Employers with religious or moral qualms will also be able to cover some birth control methods, and not others. Experts said that could interfere with efforts to promote modern long-acting implantable contraceptives, such as IUDs, which are more expensive.  The top Democrat in the House of Representatives, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, said the birth-control rollback was despicable.  “This administration’s contempt for women reaches a new low with this appalling decision to enable employers and health plans to deny women basic coverage for contraception,” she said.  On the Republican side, however, House Speaker Paul Ryan welcomed the decision, calling it “a landmark day for religious liberty.”  The new policy took effect on Friday, but its impact won’t be known immediately and may not be dramatic.  “I can’t imagine that many employers are going to be willing to certify that they have a moral objection to standard birth control methods,” said Dan Mendelson, president of the consulting firm Avalere Health.  Nonetheless, he worried that the new rules would set a precedent for undermining basic health benefits required under federal law. The administration has estimated that some 200 employers who have already voiced objections to the Obama-era policy would qualify for the expanded opt-out, and that 120,000 women would be affected.  Since contraception became a covered preventive benefit, the share of female employees paying with their own money for birth control pills has plunged to 3 percent, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.  Many Catholic hospitals now rely on an Obama-era workaround under which the government pays for the cost of birth control coverage. That workaround can continue under the new rules.  Despite that workaround, there have been extensive legal battles waged by religious institutions and other parties challenging the birth-control mandate. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops hailed the new policy as a “return to common sense” that would enhance “peaceful coexistence” between church and state.  Doctors’ groups that were instrumental in derailing Republican plans to repeal Obama’s health law outright expressed their dismay.  The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said the new policy could reverse the recent progress in lowering the nation’s rate of unintended pregnancies.  “Instead of fulfilling its mission ‘to enhance and protect the health and well-being of all Americans,’ HHS leaders under the current administration are focused on turning back the clock on women’s health,” said the organization’s president, Dr. Haywood Brown.  ___  Crary reported from New York.

349,1690,10,6,2017,2017-10-06,Associated Press News,Hurricanes cause rare monthly US job loss but rebound likely,"In this Thursday, Aug. 24, 2017, photo, Phil Wiggett, right, a recruiter with the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, looks at a resume during a job fair in San Jose, Calif. On Friday, Oct. 6, 2017, the U.S. government issues the September jobs report. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)  WASHINGTON (AP) — A pullback in U.S. hiring last month resulting from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma will likely prove short-lived, with a resilient job market pointing to gains in the coming months.  The unemployment rate fell to a fresh 16-year low of 4.2 percent, from 4.4 percent, the Labor Department said Friday in its September jobs report. The proportion of Americans with jobs rose to a nearly nine-year high. And even long-dormant wage growth showed signs of picking up.  The economy lost 33,000 jobs last month — the first monthly loss in nearly seven years — as the hurricanes closed thousands of businesses in Texas, Florida and other parts of the Southeast. Yet hiring is widely expected to rebound in coming months as companies reopen and bring back workers and construction firms ramp up repair and renovation work.  Previous natural disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005, also inflicted short-term job losses that were followed by intensified hiring.  “The labor market remains in good shape,” said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial. “The job losses were due to disruptions from hurricanes, not underlying weakness in the economy.”  Outside of hurricane-hit areas, many Americans found work. The number of people describing themselves as unemployed fell to 6.8 million, the fewest since March 2007, before the Great Recession began.  That sign of health makes it appear all but certain that the Federal Reserve will raise its benchmark short-term interest rate in December. According to data from the CME Group, investors now foresee an 88 percent chance of a Fed rate hike then.  Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said she expects pay raises to accelerate as unemployment declines. That, in turn, might lift inflation closer to the Fed’s annual 2 percent target level if companies raised prices to pay for higher salaries.  Last month’s drop was driven by huge losses in restaurants and bars, which accounted for 105,000 fewer jobs, a sign of the damage to Florida’s tourism industry. Overall, roughly 1.5 million people were unable to work last month because of the weather, the government said, the most in 20 years.  Hourly workers who couldn’t work because of the storms last month and missed a paycheck would have been counted as not working in the government’s survey of businesses, thereby lowering September’s job total. That’s true even if those employees returned to work after the storm passed or will return.  The unemployment rate fell because it is calculated with a separate survey of households. That survey counted people as employed even if they were temporarily out of work because of the storms. In fact, the proportion of adults who have jobs rose to 60.4 percent, the highest since January 2009.  That’s a sign that the low unemployment rate is pulling more Americans off the sidelines and back into the job market. During the recession and the sluggish recovery that followed, many people gave up searching for work.  Dan Harmon, chief operating officer of Smoothie King, a 900-store chain based near New Orleans, said the storms temporarily closed 66 stores in the Houston area and disrupted the company’s end-of-summer hiring. One store was so damaged it still hasn’t reopened.  In August and September, the company typically hires new employees to replace college workers who return to school. But that process was delayed in Florida and Texas.  “We weren’t able to do our normal hiring spree that we usually do going into the fall,” Harmon said.  The storms also disrupted the company’s expansion plans. It opened 65 stores nationwide in the July-September quarter. It would have opened four more, but they were damaged while under construction. Each Smoothie King employs about 15 hourly workers and two to three managers.  Nationwide, an alternative barometer of the labor force that includes not only the unemployed but also part-time workers who’d prefer full-time jobs, fell to 8.3 percent. That’s the lowest such level in over a decade.  Average hourly wages rose a healthy 2.9 percent from 12 months earlier. That trend was probably inflated by the loss of so many lower-paid workers in hurricane-hit areas. Higher-paid workers likely disproportionately boosted the wage figure.  “We think the magnitude of this distortion was quite small and the underlying wage numbers are indeed firming,” said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan Chase.  The government on Friday also revised up wage gains in August — before the hurricanes hit — to a 2.7 percent annual rate, from 2.5 percent. That suggests that pay could be picking up, even excluding the storms, and encouraging more people to look for work.  More than 11 million people had been employed in the 87 counties in Texas and Florida that were declared disaster areas, the government says. That’s equal to about 7.7 percent of the nation’s workforce.  Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which were hammered by Hurricane Maria, aren’t included in the national unemployment report. Their data will be included in the state jobs figures to be released Oct. 20.  The mostly solid employment numbers come after other signs the economy is solid. This week, a survey of services firms — covering restaurants, construction companies, retail stores, banks and others — found that they expanded in September at their fastest monthly pace since 2005. That followed a survey of manufacturers, which found an equally strong gain. Factory activity expanded at the fastest pace in more than 13 years.  Harvey caused about $76 billion to $87 billion in economic losses, according to Moody’s Analytics, an economic consulting firm. That would make Harvey the second-worst U.S. natural disaster, after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.  Irma will likely end up having caused $58 billion to $83 billion in economic losses. Those estimates include damage to homes and businesses as well as lost business and economic output.  ___  This story has been corrected to show that September’s job losses figure was the first decline in nearly seven years.",3.4107142857142856,28,"[2.5, 2.0, 4.0, 2.5, 1.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 2.5, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5, 0.5, 4.5, 4.5, 3.0, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 2.5, 4.5, 1.5, 3.5, 3.5, 5.0, 1.5]"

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File)  NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks faded a bit from their record highs on Friday after telecom and energy stocks sank. The loss for the Standard & Poor’s 500 index was small, but it was the first in nearly two weeks.  Much of the day’s action was centered on the government’s jobs report, which is usually the most anticipated economic data of each month, but it was a muddled one.  Economists cautioned not to read too much into the hiring numbers, which were far weaker than expected, because they were distorted by hurricanes that damaged businesses from Texas to Florida. Investors focused instead on a stronger-than-expected rise in workers’ wages, which helped to push Treasury yields higher.  The S&P 500 fell 2.74 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,549.33. The loss meant the end of the longest winning streak for the index in four years. Roughly nine stocks fell for every five that rose on the New York Stock Exchange.  The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 1.72, or less than 0.1 percent, to 22,773.67. The Nasdaq composite added 4.82, or 0.1 percent, to 6,590.18. All three indexes had closed at records on Thursday.  The government’s jobs report showed that employers cut more jobs last month than they added, the first time that’s happened in seven years. It’s a sharp turnaround from earlier this year, when the strengthening job market was encouraging investors to push stocks higher and higher.  Hurricanes Harvey and Irma meant the closure of thousands of businesses, and drops in employment at restaurants and bars were a big driver of last month’s decline.  Many investors saw September’s job losses as an aberration. Other economic data have been more encouraging, including strong reports on the nation’s manufacturing and services sectors earlier this week.  Friday’s jobs report also contained signs of strength. Average hourly wages jumped 2.9 percent in September from a year earlier, more than economists expected. Some of that may be due to how many lower-wage jobs were lost following the hurricanes, but the government also revised up its figure for wage growth in August.  “The previous month’s revision, that probably has the most information” of all the data points in the government’s jobs report, said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. “From the Fed’s perspective, this doesn’t change anything in terms of overall policy, but it makes them a little more worried about inflation.”  If rising wage growth feeds into higher prices across the economy, it makes the Fed that much more likely to keep raising rates from their record lows. As a result, investors made moves Friday in anticipation of a rate increase in December.  The yield on the 10-year Treasury jumped as high as 2.39 percent shortly after the release of the jobs report, up from 2.35 percent late Thursday. The gains faded later in the day, which traders said may have been due to worries about tensions with North Korea. A Russian lawmaker said that North Korea is preparing to test-fire a long-range missile soon.  By Friday evening, the 10-year yield sat at 2.36 percent. The two-year Treasury yield climbed to 1.52 percent from 1.49 percent, and the 30-year yield rose to 2.91 percent from 2.89 percent.  When bonds pay higher yields, it makes them more attractive to investors looking for income and undercuts demand for stocks that pay relatively big dividends.  Telecom stocks in the S&P 500 fell 2 percent, the largest drop among the 11 sectors that make up the index.  Energy stocks were also among the market’s weakest after the price of benchmark U.S. crude sank $1.50, or 3 percent, to settle at $49.29 per barrel. It’s the fourth drop for oil in the last five days. Brent crude, the international standard, lost $1.38, or 2.4 percent, to $55.62 per barrel.  Costco Wholesale fell the most in the S&P 500 despite reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than expected. Analysts pointed to a slight drop in its membership renewal rates, among other factors. Costco lost $9.98, or 6 percent, to $157.09.  In overseas markets, the FTSE 100 in London rose 0.2 percent, France’s CAC 40 fell 0.4 percent and Germany’s DAX dipped 0.1 percent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.3 percent, and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong added 0.3 percent.  In the currency market, the dollar slipped to 112.71 Japanese yen from 112.85 yen late Thursday.

Trump promised Americans “the largest tax cut in our country’s history,” but there’s not much in Trump’s plan to help low-income households. One independent analysis says low-income families would save about $60 a year. Another says their incomes would go up less than 1 percent. Congressional Republicans say the critiques are premature because the plan is incomplete.(AP Photo/Michael Conroy)  WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump promised Americans “the largest tax cut in our country’s history.” But for low-income households, Trump’s plan would amount to crumbs.  The poorest would get an average tax cut of about $60 a year, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center. Middle-income families would get about $300 on average.  “There’s no significant benefit for low-income families,” said Elaine Maag, a senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center. “It’s important because when low-income families get money they tend to spend it, putting it right back into the economy. High-income families tend to save it.”  Republicans have backed a budget resolution that would enable Congress to pass a tax package that could add up to $1.5 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.  The Tax Policy Center’s analysis says most of the tax cuts would go to the wealthiest Americans. For example, the top 1 percent — families making about $700,000 a year — would get an average tax cut of $129,000. Tax breaks targeting the wealthy include lowering the top income tax rate from 39.6 percent to 35 percent, eliminating the alternative minimum tax, and doing away with the federal estate tax, which is only paid by people who inherit multimillion-dollar estates.  Congressional Republicans dispute that their plan would ultimately help wealthy families more than it would help the middle class. They note that the plan unveiled by Trump and GOP leaders last week is incomplete. The plan would reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three, but it doesn’t include the income levels for each tax bracket.  The plan would also increase the $1,000 child tax credit, but it doesn’t say by how much. Those details are still being worked on.  “There is simply no way for TPC or anyone to deliver these kinds of specific estimates with the information provided in the framework,” said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.  “To get their estimates, they filled in blanks with numbers from other proposals, added a pile of exceptionally pessimistic and biased economic assumptions, and came up with a tax plan that, for all intents and purposes, is their own,” said Hatch, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee.  The Tax Policy Center says it filled in the blanks by taking numbers from a tax blueprint released by House Republicans. For example, the analysis assumes that the child tax credit would increase to $1,500.  Republican Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah want to increase the child tax credit to $2,000. Rubio says doubling the credit is the best way to target tax relief for low- and middle-income families.  The main provisions that would affect low-income families are increasing the child tax credit and raising the standard deduction from $6,300 to $12,000. This would be partially offset by eliminating the $4,050 personal exemption.  Also, the lowest tax rate would increase from 10 percent to 12 percent, but the plan doesn’t specify the income levels for each tax bracket.  In the Tax Policy Center’s analysis, low-income families make less than $25,000 a year. That puts them in the bottom 20 percent of households.  An analysis by the conservative Tax Foundation noted the plan’s lack of details. Nevertheless, it found only modest benefits for low-income families, increasing their annual incomes by an average of less than 1 percent.  The liberal Center for Budget and Policy Priorities argues that if adding to the national debt leads to spending cuts, low-income families could be worse off.  “By increasing deficits and debt, the tax cuts would intensify pressure, likely in the next several years, for steep budget cuts in programs that help low- and middle-income families,” wrote Sharon Parrott, a senior fellow at the center. “Most low- and middle-income children and their families would likely lose more from these budget cuts than they would gain from the tax cuts.”  One reason the poorest families wouldn’t get much of a tax break is that many don’t pay federal income taxes. About 44 percent of U.S. households pay no federal income tax, according to the Tax Policy Center. Most of these people pay other federal taxes, including payroll taxes.  However, when it comes to the income tax, most low-income families receive tax credits that are greater than the amount of taxes they owe. They receive the tax credits in the form of a tax refund, even though they paid no taxes.  Maag said this would not change under Trump’s tax plan.  ___  Follow Stephen Ohlemacher on Twitter at http://twitter.com/stephenatap",2.8055555555555554,54,"[0.5, 5.0, 0.5, 2.5, 3.0, 1.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.0, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 3.0, 4.5, 1.5, 3.5, 3.0, 4.5, 0.5, 3.0, 3.0, 3.5, 3.5, 1.0, 3.0, 2.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 0.5, 0.5, 3.5, 1.0, 4.5, 2.5, 0.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 0.5, 3.0, 0.5, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 2.0, 1.5, 5.0, 1.5, 2.5, 5.0, 4.0, 4.5, 0.5]"
381,1722,10,5,2017,2017-10-05,Associated Press News,Experts to start capturing rare vaquita porpoises in Mexico," U.S. Navy-trained dolphins and their handlers arrived in Mexico Thursday to participate in a last-ditch effort to catch, enclose and protect the few dozen remaining vaquita porpoises to save them from extinction.  Mexican authorities and an international group of experts say they will set out on Oct. 12 in a fleet of small boats to find the critically endangered and elusive marine mammals with the assistance of the dolphins.  Mexico — where rescue dogs became national heroes during last month’s earthquakes — was quick to release the names of the trained dolphins: Andrea, Fathom, Katrina and, understandably, Splash.  Mexican Environment Secretary Rafael Pacchiano said the U.S. government “has been a great ally in this process, in this unprecedented project.”  Experts acknowledge the catch-and-enclose plan is risky; breeding in captivity has successfully saved species such as the red wolf and California condor, but the vaquita has only been scientifically described since the 1950s and has never been bred or even held in captivity.  “The group of dolphins is trained to help us identify where the vaquitas are, so that once they are located, the group of scientists and veterinarians can capture them and take them to a sanctuary that is almost completely built,” Pacchiano said. The sanctuary is expected to be some kind of floating pen or net enclosure in a protected bay.  “The idea is to keep these vaquitas we capture in a safe, restricted space so that we can look at how to reproduce them and eventually recover the population, and eventually release them,” he said.  Jim Fallin of the U.S. Navy’s Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Pacific said the dolphins arrived at Mexico’s Gulf of California, also known as the Sea of Cortez.  “Navy Marine Mammal Program participation is being limited to four mature female dolphins selected for their gentle nature and demonstrated behavioral acumen,” Fallin said.  The dolphins will use their natural sonar to locate the extremely elusive vaquitas, then surface and advise their handlers, said Fallin. The dolphins have been trained by the Navy for tasks like locating sea mines.  Despite Mexico’s campaign to help the species, which are the world’s smallest and rarest type of porpoises, and live only in the Gulf of California, the number of remaining vaquitas is estimated to have dropped below 30.  Vaquitas are often caught in nets illegally set to catch totoaba fish, whose bladder is prized in China.  Mexico enacted a permanent ban on gillnet fishing in the northern Gulf of California earlier this year.  Alex Olivera, the Mexico representative of the Center for Biological Diversity, saluted the effort but noted the whole Gulf habitat must be protected.  “We support this last-ditch effort to save the vaquita from extinction, but it shouldn’t be used as an excuse to allow fishing to continue in its habitat,” said Olivera.  “This risky option became the only option, but vaquitas have never been captured alive before, so this effort is uncertain,” Olivera said. “It’s a high-stakes operation that’s happening because the Mexican government has shown an inability to protect the animals in the wild.”  Elsewhere, far off Mexico’s western Pacific coast, the head of the country’s nature reserves commission said Thursday that all fishing would be banned in territorial seas around the Revillagigedo Islands, located more than 400 miles (650 kilometers) from the coast.  Commission head Alejandro Del Mazo Maza said the ban imposed on the 57,175 square-mile (148,087 square kilometer) reserve would create the largest unfished marine park in North America.",3.75,6,"[2.5, 2.5, 5.0, 4.0, 4.5, 4.0]"
383,1724,10,8,2017,2017-10-08,Associated Press News,Oyster farmer’s project lets kids raise baby oysters," Rather than tending to pet guinea pigs or iguanas, Pensacola water quality advocates are encouraging students to raise baby oysters.  The project by Pensacola Bay Oyster Co. owner Donnie McMahon III and the nonprofit Bream Fishermen Association supplies children with a bag of 75 tiny oysters and a cage in exchange for a $50 donation to the association, which works to improve the quality of water in area bays and estuaries.  McMahon recently opened the oyster nursery and is supplying the oysters free of charge.  “Our ultimate goal is to raise awareness about water quality and to encourage children to become interested in marine sciences,” said McMahon, who is raising about 8 million oysters in his Perdido Key-area nursery.  The groups have reached out to area school districts and hope to eventually bring the program to classrooms.  Marine biologist Barbara Albrecht, president of the Bream Fishermen Association, said oysters have a tremendous environmental benefit because, fully grown, they filter about 55 gallons of water every day.  “Can you imagine if everyone who had a dock in our area had a bag of oysters tied to the end of it?” said Albrecht, who is organizing the oyster project.  Anyone interested in growing oysters can email TheBreamFishermen@gmail.com or visit the organization’s website, breamfishermen.org.  Raising oysters requires dedication, Albrecht said. Participants must attend a workshop to learn how to clean and care for the oysters, which should hang in a cage about two feet below the water surface.  It takes about nine months for the oysters to grow. Once they are fully grown, Bream Fishermen place them in area reefs so they can continue to filter water and serve as a habitat for other marine species.  McMahon, who is also a marine biologist, started his Pensacola Bay Oyster Co. in 2014. He had two oyster farms — the Magnolia Bluff Farm, which occupied about 5 acres in Pensacola Bay and another farm on about 5 acres in East Bay.  Although he lost about 400,000 oysters earlier this year after heavy rainfall disturbed the salinity of the water, he isn’t giving up on his dream of creating a thriving Pensacola oyster industry.  McMahon opened his oyster nursery in August and hopes to one day bring an oyster hatchery to region. The hatchery would create locally spawned oysters and would be the first such hatchery in the state of Florida.  At the Perdido Key-area nursery, manager Jonathan York tends to 8 million tiny oysters in various stages of growth. The oysters remain at the nursery for a couple of months before they are ready to be placed in cages in area waterways.  York, a former professional fisherman, said the oysters are crucial in helping area fish species to thrive.  “The quality of the water is so much better because of the oysters, and that helps the entire ecosystem,” he said.  The oysters arrive at the nursery the size of a tiny bead and grow to about 6 milometers before they are placed in cages.  York said the company hopes to eventually supply as many as 20,000 oysters a week to oyster farmers. The company sells its fully grown oysters to wholesalers and restaurants around the Southeastern U.S.  “Our crop loss was heartbreaking because we had put so much time and energy into the oysters. We had buyers lined up and then we lost everything,” he said.  But York said the company has learned from the setback.  “We are not the kind of people to sit around not doing anything,” he said. “We’ve started the nursery and we will be selling oysters again soon.”  In the meantime, York said he excited about supplying some of his tiny oysters to area children for the Bream Fishermen Association project.  “It is a very cool way for children to learn about oysters and water quality,” he said.  ___  Information from: Pensacola (Fla.)

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., look at a poster at the start of a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, October 4, 2017, urging Republicans to abandon cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Trying to revive health care talks, President Donald Trump said Saturday that he had spoken to the Senate’s Democratic leader to gauge whether the minority party was interested in helping pass “great” health legislation.  The answer back: Democrats are willing to hear his ideas, but scrapping the Obama health law is a nonstarter.  Trump’s latest overture to Democrats followed GOP failures so far to fulfill the party’s yearslong promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. In spite of controlling the White House and Congress since January, Republicans have not passed the legislation.  The president tweeted that he called New York Sen. Chuck Schumer on Friday to discuss the 2010 law known as “Obamacare,” which Trump said “is badly broken, big premiums. Who knows!” Trump said he wanted “to see if the Dems want to do a great HealthCare Bill.”  In remarks Saturday evening on the South Lawn before a trip to North Carolina, Trump said he was willing to consider “a temporary deal.” What that might involve was not clear, but Trump referred to a popular GOP proposal that would have the federal government turn over money for health care directly to states in the form of block grants.  “If we could do a one-year deal or a two-year deal as a temporary measure, you’ll have block granting ultimately to the states, which is what the Republicans want. That really is a repeal and replace,” he said. In an interview taped earlier this week and aired Saturday night on Trinity Broadcasting Network, the president assured host Mike Huckabee that “we’ll have health care before the election.”  Schumer said through a spokesman Saturday that Trump “wanted to make another run at repeal and replace and I told the president that’s off the table.” Schumer said if Trump “wants to work together to improve the existing health care system, we Democrats are open to his suggestions.”  Trump has suggested before that he would be open to negotiating with Democrats on health care, but there have been no clear signs of a compromise between Republicans who have sought to scrap President Barack Obama’s law and Democrats who want to protect it.  Schumer said a starting point could be negotiations led by Sens. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Patty Murray, D-Wash., who have been discussing a limited bipartisan deal to stabilize state-level markets for individual health insurance policies. People covered under the health law represent about half of those who purchase individual policies.  Trump irritated GOP leaders in Congress when he reached a deal with Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on a spending bill and the debt ceiling. The president has referred to those two Democrats as “Chuck and Nancy.”  But the Trump administration announced Friday that it would allow more employers to opt out of no-cost birth control to women by claiming religious or moral objections. The move was one more attempt to roll back Obama’s health overhaul, prompting Democrats to question whether Trump is committed to avoiding sabotaging the law.  Trump floated the potential talks as he approved an emergency declaration for a large part of Louisiana and ordered federal assistance for the state as Hurricane Nate approached the central Gulf of Mexico.  The president headlined a fundraiser on Saturday night in Greensboro, North Carolina, to benefit his Trump Victory joint fundraising committee with the Republican National Committee. The event was expected to raise $2 million, with donors paying up to $35,000 per couple to serve as co-hosts.  Before leaving for North Carolina, Trump repeated his assertion that trying to negotiate with North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs is a waste of time.  In a two-part tweet, he said: “Presidents and their administrations have been talking to North Korea for 25 years, agreements made and massive amounts of money paid ... hasn’t worked, agreements violated before the ink was dry, makings fools of U.S. negotiators. Sorry, but only one thing will work!”  Trump’s tweets Saturday and earlier in the week were seen directed either at undermining Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s efforts to maintain channels of communication or at somehow bolstering the diplomat’s hand in possible future talks.  __  On Twitter, follow Ken Thomas at @KThomasDC.",4.076923076923077,13,"[3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 2.5, 3.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.5]"

On Saturday, Oct. 7, 2017, Myers, who has been among the most vocal critics of President Donald Trump, tweeted that he'd ""love"" to have Trump on his NBC show, in response to one of his messages. (Photo by Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP, File)  President Donald Trump lashed out Saturday against late night television show hosts who have been sharply critical of his administration and Republicans.  Trump took to Twitter to argue that the GOP should be given “equal time” because of the “one-sided” coverage, an apparent reference to Federal Communications Commission rules dealing with political candidates during elections.  “Late Night host(s) are dealing with the Democrats for their very ‘unfunny’ & repetitive material, always anti-Trump!” he tweeted. “Should we get Equal Time?”  Trump also suggested “more and more people” are clamoring for more coverage of Republicans, who control the White House and Congress  Seth Meyers, who has been among the most vocal Trump critics, immediately tweeted back that he’d “love” to have Trump on his NBC show, and sarcastically provided his studio address as “15 Penguin Avenue, Antarctica.”  ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel, another critic, added : “Excellent point Mr. President! You should quit that boring job - I’ll let you have my show ALL to yourself #MAGA.”  And Comedy Central’s Daily Show responded by posting — “in the spirit of equal time”— Trump’s now infamous off-camera comments in 2005 to an “Access Hollywood” host in which he used coarse language to boast about groping women.  Others pointed out that “equal time” is meant for campaign season, not to protect elected officials from being the butt of television humor.  “That’s not how it works. You’re not campaigning. You’re the president,” Mike DiCenzo, a writer and producer for NBC’s “The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon,” tweeted . “Now kindly stop tweeting nonsense and go do your job for once.”  The FCC rule says political candidates should be treated equally by broadcast television stations when it comes to selling or giving away air time. Over the years, the commission has broadly exempted news programs, including late night talk shows, from the provision.  Trump’s tweets followed shortly after a segment on Fox News’ “Fox and Friends” critiquing many late show hosts for taking “a hard turn to the left.”  The president’s reference to “dealing with Democrats” appears to allude to recent reports that Kimmel consulted with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, before delivering a series of emotional and personal monologues against Republicans’ attempts to repeal and replace the health care law that was championed by former President Barack Obama.  Kimmel’s son, Billy, was born this year with a congenital heart defect, a pre-existing condition the late night host argued would have prevented the boy from getting health insurance if not for the Affordable Care Act that Obama signed in 2010.  Trump’s ire for his late night critics— who also include CBS’ Stephen Colbert and even Fallon at times — is not totally unfounded.  A study by researchers at George Mason University in Virginia found that Trump in on pace to “easily eclipse” the most jokes about any person tracked by its Center for Media and Public Affairs since it began monitoring in 1988.  The New York billionaire was the target of more than 1,000 jokes during his first 100 days in office, surpassing the 936 jokes made at Obama’s expense in his first year in office in 2009 and more than the 546 about George W.

387,1729,10,7,2017,2017-10-07,Associated Press News,Expressing empathy remains a challenge for Trump,"President Donald Trump speaks before signing a National Manufacturing Day Proclamation in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, Friday, Oct. 6, 2017. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)  WASHINGTON (AP) — As the death toll from the shooting in Las Vegas rapidly rose, White House officials urged President Donald Trump to show restraint in his response: No speculative tweets, please. No over-the-top bluster.  White House chief of staff John Kelly encouraged a simple tweet of condolences. Aides wrote somber remarks that had Trump quoting Scripture. Some around the president were encouraged to hear him connecting to the tragedy on a personal level — talking about his property and calling friends in Las Vegas, in a sign he was taking in the impact of the event.  The anxious counsel from his aides as Trump prepared to react to the mass shooting was a reminder of Trump’s troubled track record in such delicate moments. Trump often has had difficulty embracing a central role of the American presidency: consoling people dealing with intense grief, regardless of their political affiliation or support for the White House’s agenda. It’s a quality rarely debated or analyzed during a campaign, yet one that can shape the way people view the success of their president.  Trump’s challenges with empathy were on full display this past week as he responded to two disasters at once with very different results.  Trump ultimately stuck to the script in Las Vegas, avoiding controversy and assuming the role of national healer. That measured response stood in contrast to his uneven response to the hurricane in Puerto Rico. Trump lashed out at the mayor of San Juan, urged officials to say positive things about his administration and threw rolls of paper towels into the crowd at a relief center like he was tossing T-shirts at a sporting event.  This account is based on conversations with 11 White House aides and others who spoke with the president over the past week.  Presidents are remembered for the way they respond in moments of great tumult or trial.  Bill Clinton’s speech after the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing helped him right his struggling presidency. George W. Bush’s bullhorn address while standing atop the rubble of the World Trade Center helped heal the nation after the 9/11 attacks. Yet Bush’s presidency would never fully recover from the government’s botched response to Hurricane Katrina, which left many with the perception that he was detached from the suffering on the ground.  In the first days after Maria struck Puerto Rico, Trump was more focused on his feud with NFL players who were kneeling during the national anthem. As images of the devastation in Puerto Rico began appearing more frequently on television, aides intensified their briefings. Trump, however, complained about the U.S. territory’s debt and became fixated on the criticism from San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, according to three White House officials and outside allies.  Trump decided to hit back on Twitter, ignoring advice from Kelly and homeland security adviser Tom Bossert to focus on the recovery.  The public has been watching.  Just 32 percent of Americans approve of how Trump has handled disaster relief in Puerto Rico, while 49 percent disapprove, according to a poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.  Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., called Trump’s visit to the island an insult.  “When we see the president of the United States go to Puerto Rico throwing toilet paper, paper towels, what is that saying to the American people? It is an affront,” Lewis said Thursday.  The president, however, believed his Tuesday trip went well, according to a person who spoke with him after the visit.  “I think he’s an old school John Wayne-type guy who doesn’t like to wear emotions on his shirt sleeves,” said Chris Ruddy, a longtime friend and chairman of Newsmax. “He doesn’t cry in public and he doesn’t like men who do.”  White House communications director Hope Hicks described Trump as a “strong leader, but also a compassionate one. He cares deeply for the people of our country and he understands the importance of leading with his head, as well as his heart, especially in the most challenging of times.”  Kelly and other aides scripted out a more measured response for the president after the Las Vegas shooting that left 58 people dead. Trump largely followed the game plan, including avoiding public speculation about the motive of the shooter in a city where he owns a hotel. Trump consulted several friends there, including casino magnate and mega-donor Sheldon Adelson, about his response. Trump told aides he wanted to salute the law enforcement personnel he believes prevented the massacre from being worse.  Trump often struggled as a candidate to exude the kind of empathy that comes naturally to some politicians.  In the summer of 2016, aides tried repeatedly to explain to Trump why his attacks on Khizr Khan, a Muslim-American whose son was killed fighting for the U.S. military in Iraq, were off-putting to so many voters. One former campaign official said Trump was unmoved by arguments about the sacrifices Khan’s family had made for the country and couldn’t get past the fact that Khan had spoken out against the Republican nominee during the Democratic Party’s convention.  Trump’s staff tried to limit small, potentially emotional gatherings with supporters, knowing that Trump preferred the distance of a large, roaring crowd. In October, as he made a last-minute push to win Florida, advisers prepped Trump about the story of Miriam de la Pena, whose son’s plane was shot down by the Cuban government in 1996, according to another former campaign staffer.  But Trump was far more focused on the endorsement he was set to receive later that day and, as de la Pena choked up recounting her tale, his eyes wandered around the room, only turning to say “very sad story” when the tearful mother finished speaking.  Former advisers say Trump also appears to lack any understanding of the impact his often sharp-tongued tirades can have on aides. One adviser recalled being berated by Trump in the Oval Office, in front of multiple colleagues, in particularly humiliating fashion. The next day, Trump called the adviser on the phone and started joking as though the previous day’s outburst had never happened.  ___  Lemire reported from New York.  ___  Follow Lemire at http://twitter.com/jonlemire and Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC",3.6666666666666665,6,"[0.5, 3.0, 4.5, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0]"

(AP Photo/Carlos Giusti, File)  Facebook and Google once aimed to connect the world. Now they would be happy just to reconnect part of it.  In the wake of Hurricane Maria, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg pledged to send a “connectivity team” to help restore communications in ravaged Puerto Rico. Google parent company Alphabet offered to send its Wi-Fi balloons. They were among several tech companies proposing disaster response ideas, most aimed at getting phone and internet service up and running.  Some of these plans, of course, are more aspirational than others.  BATTERY POWER  Tesla CEO Elon Musk often takes to Twitter to mull over ideas, but on Friday his musings about sending his company’s solar-powered batteries to help restore Puerto Rico’s power attracted the attention of the island’s governor.  “Let’s talk,” said Gov. Ricardo Rossello in a Friday tweet .  Musk agreed. Hours later, he announced he was delaying the unveiling of Tesla’s new semi-truck and diverting resources, in part to “increase battery production for Puerto Rico and other affected areas.”  The need for help in restoring power and communication after Hurricane Maria is great: The Puerto Rican energy authority reported Saturday that about 88 percent of the island is still without power. The Federal Communications Commission said Saturday that 82 percent of cell sites remain out in Puerto Rico; 58 percent are out of service in the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The FCC’s daily status report also shows significant wireline, TV and radio outages remain in both U.S. territories. The agency formed a task force this week and approved an advance of $77 million to support carriers working to restore telecommunications services.  VAGUE PROMISES  But many offers of help from big companies remain somewhat vague. Google parent company Alphabet has proposed launching balloons over the island to bring Wi-Fi service to hard-to-reach places, as it has in other parts of the world.  The FCC announced Saturday that it’s approved an experimental license for Project Loon to operate in Puerto Rico. But that doesn’t mean it will able to get them in the air anytime soon.  “We’re grateful for the support of the FCC and the Puerto Rican authorities as we work hard to see if it’s possible to use Loon balloons to bring emergency connectivity to the island during this time of need,” said Libby Leahy, a spokesman for Alphabet’s X division.  But there are limitations, she said Saturday.  “To deliver signal to people’s devices, Loon needs be integrated with a telco partner’s network — the balloons can’t do it alone,” she said, adding that the company is “making solid progress on this next step.”  COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS  Cisco Systems has sent a tactical team and says it is working with local government, emergency responders and service providers to facilitate restoration and recovery efforts. The company, along with Microsoft and others, backs the NetHope consortium, which specializes in setting up post-disaster communication networks and has field teams now operating in Puerto Rico and several other Caribbean islands.  “Communication is critical during a disaster,” Zuckerberg said after the hurricane hit, announcing that employees from his company’s connectivity team — the same group working to build high-altitude drones that can beam internet service down to Earth — were heading to Puerto Rico. But with its aircraft still in the testing phase, the company said Friday that the engineers it’s sent to Puerto Rico are focused on providing support to NetHope’s teams.  SMALLER ORGANIZATIONS  Much of the ground work is being spearheaded by nonprofit organizations and small firms with expertise in rural or emergency communications.  Lexington, Massachusetts-based Vanu Inc., which sets up wireless communications networks in rural parts of the United States, Africa and India, is sending dozens of its small, solar-powered cellular base stations to volunteer crews on the ground in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Aid workers are pairing Vanu’s devices with other technology, such as inflatable satellite antennas.  After setting up a network on the island of Vieques, off the main island of Puerto Rico, one team watched from a roof as local residents started getting text alerts from family members who had been trying to get in touch.  “They noticed everyone in the plaza pulling their phones out,” said CEO Vanu Bose. “You don’t have to announce you’ve lit up coverage.

(AP Photo/Scott Heppell, File)  NEW YORK (AP) — Donald Trump boasts of making great deals, but a financial report filed with the British government shows he has lost millions of dollars for three years running on a couple of his more recent big investments: his Scottish golf resorts.  A report from Britain’s Companies House released late Friday shows losses last year at the two resorts more than doubled to 17.6 million pounds ($23 million). Revenue also fell sharply.  In the report, Trump’s company attributed the results partly to having shut down its Turnberry resort for half the year while building a new course there and fixing up an old one.  His company has faced several setbacks since it ventured into Scotland a dozen years ago, and its troubles recently have mounted.  The company has angered some local residents near its second resort on the North Sea with what they say are its bullying tactics to make way for more development. The company also has lost a court fight to stop an offshore windmill farm near that resort, drew objections from environmental regulators over building plans there in August and appears at risk of losing a bid to host the coveted Scottish Open at its courses.  Amanda Miller, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, declined to comment about the results.  Trump handed over management of his company to his two adult sons before becoming U.S. president, but still retains his financial interest in it.  It’s not clear how big a role Trump’s setbacks in Scotland have played in the losses. In addition to the Turnberry shutdown, the company also noted in its report that it took an 8 million pound ($10 million) loss due to fluctuations in the value of the British pound last year.  The company reported that revenue at the two courses fell 21 percent to 9 million pounds ($11.7 million) in 2016 from 11.4 million pounds ($15 million) a year earlier.  Trump’s golf business is closely watched because he has made big investments buying and developing courses in recent years, a risky wager in a struggling industry. It is also a bit of departure for the company. Trump has mostly played it safe in other parts of his business, putting his name on buildings owned by others and taking a marketing and management fee instead of investing himself.  Much of the anger toward Trump in Scotland is centered around his resort outside Aberdeen overlooking the North Sea coast and its famed sand dunes stretching into the distance. Called the Trump International Golf Links, it is here that a local fisherman became a national hero of sorts for refusing a $690,000 offer from Trump for his land and where footage was shot for a documentary on Trump’s fights with the residents, called “Tripping Up Trump.”  Many locals praise the course for bringing in more tourists to the area and helping the local economy, but Trump’s critics there are outspoken and now, with their target the U.S. president, playing to a worldwide audience.  The same day that the financial report on the resorts was released, an online petition by a global corporate watchdog group fighting Trump’s plans for a second 18-hole course to the North Sea resort got signature number 94,860.  When Trump visited his North Sea resort in June last year, two local residents ran Mexican flags up a pole in protest against the then-candidate’s immigration policies. It was a snub that came just after the U.K. Supreme Court ruled unanimously against Trump’s efforts to stop the wind farm, a Scottish government decision to strip him of his title as business ambassador for Scotland and the revocation of an honorary degree from Aberdeen’s Robert Gordon University.  Both the Scottish government and the university cited Trump’s comments about Muslims during the campaign.  In July, the CEO of a major sponsor of the Scottish Open was quoted in a local newspaper casting doubt on Trump’s chances of hosting the event.  “There’s no decision made but, look, there are clear issues,” Aberdeen Asset Management CEO Martin Gilbert was quoted saying. He added, “Politics aside, Trump would be an ideal venue — but you can’t put politics aside.”  Asked for clarification on Friday about what Martin meant by “issues” and “politics,” Aberdeen Asset spokesman James Thorneley told the AP: “It’s pretty kind of obvious, right?” Pressed, he said he would not comment further.  This summer, Scotland’s Environmental Protection Agency and the Scottish Natural Heritage, a conservation group, sent letters to the Aberdeenshire Council urging it to reject Trump’s plans for the second course if he did not make certain changes. A vote by the local government, expected in August, was postponed.  The global watchdog group behind the online petition, SumofUs, used the environmental objections in its plea for signatures. It also seized on Trump’s reaction to the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, to muster support, arguing that Trump’s rhetoric has “bolstered white supremacists” across the globe.  Its argument on its website: “Now we have a chance to reject Trump’s hatred and protect our environment in one fell swoop.”  Still, the two courses are widely praised for their beauty, and tourists on buses like to stop by the North Sea course for a round.

Thousands are gathering at simultaneous rallies in Madrid and Barcelona in a call for dialogue amid a political crisis caused by Catalonia's secession push. (AP Photo/Emilio Morenatti)  BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Thousands rallied in Madrid and Barcelona on Saturday in a last-ditch call for Spanish and Catalan leaders to stave off a national crisis amid Catalonia’s threat to secede.  The rallies in the Spanish capital and the Catalan city were held with the slogan “Shall We Talk?” in an effort to push lawmakers in both cities to end months of silence and start negotiating. Attendees respected the organizers’ call to not bring the Spanish or Catalan flag.  Catalonia’s regional president Carles Puigdemont has vowed to make good on the results of last Sunday’s disputed referendum on secession won by the Yes side. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy warned that the vote was illegal and has promised that Catalonia is going nowhere.  Protestors packed Barcelona’s Sant Jaume Square where the Catalan government has its presidential palace, shouting “We want to talk!” and holding signs saying “More Negotiation, Less Testosterone!” and “Talk or Resign!”  “We have to find a new way forward,” said Miquel Iceta, the leader of Spain’s Socialist party in Catalonia. “It’s the moment to listen to the people who are asking for the problem to be solved through an agreement, and without precipitated and unilateral decisions.”  The gathering around Madrid’s Cibeles fountain boasted a huge banner demanding that leaders start talking. Some people chanted “Less hate, and more understanding!”  In a separate rally in Madrid’s Colon Square, thousands clamored for the unity of Spain and against any attempt by the northeastern region to break away. The crowd bristled with Spanish flags. Pro-union forces will try to generate momentum on Sunday in a protest in Barcelona.  Other protests asking for dialogue were held in cities including Valencia, Bilbao, Pamplona and Sanitago de Compostela, news agency Europa Press reported.  The calls for dialogue and unity come after a traumatic week, with riot police storming several polling stations in an unsuccessful attempt to impede the referendum. Instead, hundreds of voters were left in need of medical attention.  Even though 2.2 million Catalan voted — with 90 percent backing independence— the referendum polled less than half of the region’s electorate. Puigdemont declared he would seek a declaration of independence in the regional parliament anyway.  The bloodied vote was followed by a strike on Tuesday across Catalonia to protest the police violence. Then came the stern message from Spain’s King Felipe VI that the Catalan government and parliament were breaking the law.  Puigdemont and his separatist supporters were struck a blow when Catalonia’s top two banks, CaixaBank and Banco Sabadell, as well as energy giant Gas Natural announced they were relocating their headquarters from Catalonia to other parts of Spain.  Other companies are considering such a move to ensure that the region’s possible secession wouldn’t knock them out of the European Union and its lucrative common market.  Spain’s Minister of Public Works Inigo de la Serna said on Saturday that “the companies will keep leaving and it’s exclusively the fault of the members of the regional government.”  The warnings by the business sector have coincided with the first calls from within Puigdemont’s government to hold off on a declaration of independence.  Santi Vila, Catalonia’s regional chief for business, told Cadena SER Radio late Friday that he’s pushing for “a new opportunity for dialogue” with Spanish authorities.  “We have to give it one more chance, maybe the last chance, and perhaps the only way that can happen is to start with a cease-fire,” Vila said.  Vila said he would like to see Spanish authorities return powers to the region which they have assumed in recent weeks, including control of a large part of its finances.  It is unclear how widespread Vila’s moderate position is inside the Catalan government, which is being pressured by separatist grassroots groups and the far-left party CUP to declare independence soon.  Separatist lawmakers had planned to discuss a secession plan on Monday, but that session in the regional parliament was suspended by the Constitutional Court.  The focus has shifted to Tuesday, when Puigdemont is set to address the regional parliament “to report on the current political situation.”  The most recent polls taken before the referendum showed that the region’s 7.5 million residents were roughly split on the issue.",3.4454545454545453,55,"[4.0, 1.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 3.0, 2.0, 5.0, 4.0, 2.5, 4.0, 5.0, 4.5, 2.0, 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 4.5, 5.0, 3.0, 3.5, 1.5, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 2.5, 2.0, 3.5, 3.5, 2.5, 4.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 2.0, 1.5, 3.5, 4.5, 2.5, 2.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 1.5, 3.5, 3.0, 4.5, 5.0, 4.5, 1.5]"

The Trump administration sent an immigration policy wish-list to Congress that includes overhauling the country's green-card system, hiring 10,000 more immigration officers and building a wall along the southern border. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)  WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s long list of immigration demands has landed with a thud among lawmakers hopeful for a deal to protect hundreds of thousands of young immigrants from deportation.  The list of demands released late Sunday includes funding for a southern border wall and a crackdown on so-called sanctuary cities — items that are cheered by the president’s most loyal supporters, but are non-starters among Democrats and could divide Republicans, who will have to come together on any deal.  The demands have left pro-immigration activists alarmed. And some are scratching their heads, given that the president appeared to sign off on a more palatable deal with Democrats just weeks ago.  “To stall the progress that Democrats and Republicans have been fostering in giving permanent relief to more than 800,000 DREAMers is sabotage,” said U.S. Rep. Raúl Grijalva, an Arizona Democrat and frequent Trump critic.  House and Senate leaders on both sides of the aisle have said they want to find a legislative solution to extend protections first granted under former President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. Trump announced last month that he was phasing out DACA, but gave Congress six months to act before recipients’ work permits begin to expire.  Trump suggested at the time that he was eager for a deal, telling reporters, “I have a love for these people and hopefully now Congress will be able to help them and do it properly.”  Days later, he appeared to reach the broad outlines of an agreement with the House and Senate’s top Democrats, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, in which the president would be open to extended DACA protections in exchange for a package of border security measures.  While Trump made clear that he still expected funding for his border wall, he said repeatedly that the funding could come later, in separate legislation.  In a joint statement Sunday night, Pelosi and Schumer said Trump could not “be serious about” the plan the White House had unveiled, which includes not only the wall, but dozens of other controversial measures, including a crackdown on unaccompanied immigrant minors and a complete overhaul of the legal immigration system.  Some of those who hope to see DACA protections extended said they remain optimistic the president will show flexibility, treating the priorities as a policy wish-list and starting point for negotiation.  Others see the demands as part of a plot orchestrated by Trump’s chief policy adviser, Stephen Miller, an immigration hardliner, to derail any chance of a DACA deal.  “I don’t think President Trump wants to be the president who deports 700,000 young people,” said Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, who described the list as a “big torpedo” to bipartisan negotiations already under way.  “I think the president’s staff have led him into a corner,” Noorani said, predicting the president would “not be happy when he realizes it.”  But one person familiar with the president’s thinking said the list was intended to make clear that Trump is no longer interested in forging a DACA deal, the same message sent by a White House official’s insistence Sunday that any path to citizenship for DACA recipients was off the table.  After backing an establishment Senate candidate who lost by 10 points in an Alabama special election last month, the president is working to please his base supporters, signing a new religious liberty executive order and broadcasting his intention to decertify the Iran nuclear deal.  “The president has made clear he wants Congress to act and pass responsible immigration reform in conjunction with any legislation related to DACA, which will include legal authorities to close border security loopholes, restoring interior enforcement, and reforming the legal immigration system,” said White House spokeswoman Kelly Love.  Presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway told Fox News the president was “open to a deal” on DACA but only “along with all these other critical functions.”  “You know for years, this country, including Capitol Hill and the swamp, they’ve always asked: what more can we do for the illegal immigrant, what’s fair to the illegal immigrant? This president is asking: what’s fair to America? What’s fair to the American worker? What’s fair to the American community?” she said.  Both Democrats and Republicans have pointed to a hoped-for year-end package of spending bills as the likely vehicle to tackle immigration issues, including any potential DACA deal.  Democratic votes will be required to enact the year-end measure, but many Democrats have said they won’t support any legislation that doesn’t address DACA recipients, raising the possibility of a government shutdown just before Christmas.  Controversy over border wall funding already meant the year-end package would be difficult. But one potential opening is that the White House has been willing in the past to accept border fencing and other security steps that fall short of Trump’s vision for a wall along the entire length of the border.  Either way, Trump’s zig-zagging seemed likely to erode the trust that will likely be required to seal any agreement.  Rep. Luis Gutiérrez, D-Ill., said that, after Sunday, the president should not be considered a reliable negotiating partner. “Any decision the president makes one day is likely to be completely reversed another, depending on which extremist adviser he is listening to that day,” he said.  Still others, including Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., applauded the measures, calling the president “spot on.”  House Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows said: “We look forward to the administration’s insistence on these principles in any deal that is signed into law. ”",3.42,25,"[0.5, 2.5, 4.5, 3.0, 5.0, 2.0, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 2.5, 3.5, 1.5, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 1.5, 2.5, 4.0]"

Bob Corker, R-Tenn., speaks to reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington.

He’s just the only one who’s sounding off in public. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen. Bob Corker is hardly the only Republican lawmaker raising dark concerns about harm President Donald Trump might cause the U.S. and the world. But he’s one of the few willing to air those worries in public.  Most GOP senators were silent Monday, a day after Corker charged that the White House was an “adult day care” and Trump could set the nation “on the path to World War III.”  The only senator who publicly hinted at similar concerns was Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, who said both Trump and Corker should “cool it.”  “And I think it would help if the president would be the first to cool it,” he added.  Tennessee’s Corker, with his Twitter broadsides and an explosive weekend New York Times interview, gave voice to concerns that circulate widely on Capitol Hill about an unpredictable president whose tendency to personalize every issue creates risks for the GOP agenda. But Trump’s enduring popularity with a segment of the GOP base serves as a political muzzle that keeps most elected Republicans from saying anything similar, even those who believe it to be true.  Grassley, who won’t be up for re-election until 2022, responded bluntly when asked about the situation.  “I don’t see how it’s productive, and I think that two words would kind of answer your question from my point of view: Cool it,” he said. “I think it would be better if we stuck to the issues and leave personalities out of it.”  A few other Republican senators who provided public views Monday avoided aligning themselves with Corker.  “You’ll have to ask Sen. Corker what led him to make that statement. I haven’t made that statement,” Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said of Corker’s suggestion that Trump could take the country into another world war.  Sen. Jeff Flake has been outspoken in his criticism of Trump, who’s attacked him in return. But the Arizona Republican was restrained during a joint interview with Rubio after a re-election fundraiser in Scottsdale.  “Any of us who’ve worked with Sen. Corker know that he speaks his mind,” Flake said, demurring on whether he shares Corker’s view that the White House has become an “adult day care center.”  “I agree with him on some things, I’ve supported a lot of his agenda, some things I’ve disagreed with and continue to do so,” Flake said of Trump.  The Associated Press sought to contact all 52 Republican senators Monday for their response to Corker’s comments and ask whether they believe Trump is fit for office, a question Corker declined to answer in the Times interview. With the Senate on recess this week and many offices closed for Columbus Day, the inquiries elicited few responses, and those who did largely declined comment.  Corker offered no solution to the problem he identified so graphically. Trump is the president, and few doubt that he will remain so, despite constitutional provisions for impeachment or for the vice president to take over if the commander in chief cannot discharge his duties.  Moreover, Republicans’ political fortunes remain tied to the president’s. They need his signature if they are to rescue a flagging agenda and pass a tax overhaul, a goal many believe is imperative if the GOP is to retain control of Congress in next year’s midterm elections. So unlike Corker, who recently announced he is not running for re-election in Tennessee, even GOP Trump critics will continue to mute their concerns about his behavior and try to work with the administration.  “Sen. Corker, who’s been a strong supporter of the president in the past, is essentially saying the emperor has no clothes,” said Michael Steel, who served as spokesman to former House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio.  But, Steel added: “The president was elected under our constitutional system and that’s where we stand. Congressional leaders are going to continue concentrating on doing everything they can to get big things done for the American people, and they hope to have as much support from the administration as possible.”  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the target of Trump attacks after the Senate’s failure to pass health care legislation, didn’t directly answer when asked at an event in Hazard, Kentucky, whether he shared Corker’s sentiments.  “Sen. Corker is a valuable member of the Senate Republican caucus and he’s also on the Budget Committee and a particularly important player as we move to the floor on the budget next week,” McConnell said.  His comments underscored what has frustrated Republicans most about the Trump-Corker feud, which burst open Sunday when Trump began tweeting, inaccurately, that Corker had begged for his endorsement and decided not to run for re-election when Trump turned him down. Trump will need Corker if he is to get big tax changes through the Senate, where the narrow GOP majority was unable to pass McConnell’s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. And Corker also figures to be a key player if Trump moves as expected to unwind the Iran nuclear deal.  Vice President Mike Pence, in a statement that never mentioned Corker, praised the president for “achieving real results on the international stage. While critics engage in empty rhetoric and baseless attacks.”  Republicans do frequently complain about Trump’s attacks on fellow Republicans like McConnell, his failure to stay focused on his legislative agenda and his tendency to make demands on Congress and then blame lawmakers for poor results. But those GOP comments are nothing like Corker’s apocalyptic statements.  For House Republicans, who face voters every two years and largely represent conservative districts where support for the president remains strong, there’s even less incentive to turn against the commander in chief. Sixty-eight percent of Republican voters approve of Trump, though that’s down from 80 percent in March, according to a recent AP-NORC poll.  Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina, chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, criticized Corker, saying he finds “those type of comments to not be appropriate especially coming from the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and certainly not in keeping with what I know of the way that things are conducted in the West Wing, having been there multiple times.”  “It’s really easy to be bold when you’re not coming back,” Meadows added of Corker.  ___  Associated Press writers Adam Beam in Hazard, Kentucky, and Bob Christie in Scottsdale, Arizona, contributed to this report.

Melania Trump appears to becoming more at ease with her role as first lady. She is beginning to speak out more about how she envisions using her platform to help children in ways beyond cyberbullying. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)  WASHINGTON (AP) — It was a moment eight months in the making: Melania Trump bounding down the White House lawn to the vegetable garden made famous by her predecessor.  Clad in a red plaid shirt, her eyes obscured by dark sunglasses, she greeted members of the local Boys and Girls Club who came to help her harvest and plant new crops. One skeptically asked, “Are you Melania Trump?”  “Yes, I’m the first lady” came her cheerful reply. It included two words Mrs. Trump has been using more often lately: first lady.  She says “my platform” a lot more, too.  As Mrs. Trump becomes more comfortable with her new role, she is speaking out about how she envisions using that platform to help children. She’s going beyond cyberbullying, which she’d identified during the presidential campaign as an issue that she would tackle if her husband became president but on which she has yet to announce any formal plan of action.  In a recent flurry of solo public appearances from the United Nations to an international sports event in Canada to the White House, Mrs. Trump has provided clues about her plans in a role that has thrust her into a spotlight far different from the bright lights she grew accustomed to during her career as a fashion model. She tweeted Monday that she’ll be in West Virginia on Tuesday to visit a care center for babies born addicted to opioids.  The first lady called on attendees at a U.N. luncheon last month to set good examples for children. She invited experts and people affected by drug addiction and opioid abuse, including a recovered addict, to the White House for a listening session and told them she plans to “use my platform as first lady” to help as many kids as possible.  During a visit to storm-ravaged Puerto Rico with her husband, Mrs. Trump told Puerto Rico’s non-voting representative in Congress that she was “passionate” about trying to help more communities on the island and asked how she might be able to do that, according to Rep. Jenniffer González-Colón.  The first lady also took her first solo trip — to Canada — to cheer Americans participating in an athletic competition for wounded service members and veterans.  And, on that sunny afternoon in the garden that was the brainchild of former first lady Michelle Obama, she encouraged the children helping her to make healthy eating a priority.  “I’m a big believer in healthy eating because it reflects on your mind and your body,” she said before telling the group to “come with me and have some fun.” She later pulled leeks from the ground and clipped an artichoke from a nearby plant. “I encourage you to continue and eat a lot of vegetables and fruits so you grow up healthy and take care of yourself. ... It’s very important.”  The first lady showed some pique Monday when Donald Trump’s first wife, Ivana, referred to herself as “first lady” in an interview on ABC’s “Good Morning America.”  Ivana Trump said she tries not to call her ex-husband too much because “I don’t want to cause any kind of jealousy or something like that because I’m basically first Trump wife. I’m first lady, ok?”  Melania Trump’s spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, called that comment “attention-seeking and self-serving noise.”  Mrs. Trump is a unique first lady: a native of Slovenia and former fashion model fluent in several languages. But like her predecessors, she’s still going through an adjustment period.  She was rarely seen in the weeks after the inauguration, and was usually at Trump’s side when she did appear in public. In an unusual move for modern first ladies, she and Barron, the couple’s now-11-year-old son, lived at the family’s Trump Tower penthouse in New York for several months after the inauguration so he wouldn’t have to switch schools in the middle of the year.  They joined Trump at the White House in June, and Barron startd sixth grade at a private school in Maryland after Labor Day.  “I still have a feeling she looks at this and says, ‘Am I really in this position?’” said Myra Gutin, a professor at Rider University who writes about first ladies.  Others attribute the first lady’s more visible, though still low, profile to her satisfaction that her only child is OK after the big move.  “The more comfortable she becomes in the position, the more great work she’s going to be able to do,” said Sam Nunberg, a former Trump campaign aide.  Melania is the most popular Trump in the White House, according to a recent CNN survey in which 44 percent of those polled said they have a favorable opinion of the first lady. Mrs. Trump bested the president, stepdaughter Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, Ms. Trump’s husband, in the late-September poll.  It’s typical for first ladies to be more popular than their husbands, who are called upon to sound off on a host of difficult issues. Christopher Ruddy, CEO of the Newsmax website and one of the president’s longtime friends, said he thinks the American people respect the fact that the first lady put her son’s needs first.  “She wasn’t just going to rush down to Washington because her husband was elected,” Ruddy said.  Even Trump, who has experienced some of the lowest public approval ratings of a first-year president, has called attention to his wife’s popularity.  “She’s become very, very popular, I’ll tell you that,” Trump said after she introduced him at a recent event at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. He said she has become an “incredible emissary” for the American people. “Very proud of her.”  But the higher profile brings sharper scrutiny, too.  On Trump’s first trip to Texas after the hurricane, the first lady’s decision to wear stilettos as she left the White House was panned on social media. Many criticized her footwear as inappropriate for the circumstances, leading Grisham to lament the focus on shoes during a natural disaster. Mrs. Trump changed into sneakers for the arrival of Air Force One in Corpus Christi.  Trump defended his wife’s shoe choice, saying in an interview with former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee on Trinity Broadcasting Network Saturday that she has “taken tremendous abuse.”  “She wants to look, out of respect for the White House, wants to look good leaving the front entrance to the White House. So she dresses up, she puts on formal shoes, high-heels, and she leaves the White House going to Texas,” Trump said.  ___  Associated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report.  ___  Follow Darlene Superville on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dsupervilleap",3.5416666666666665,12,"[1.5, 4.5, 5.0, 2.5, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 3.5, 1.0, 3.5]"

Most Asian markets rose Monday following a strong week on Wall Street as Chinese trading resumed after a holiday. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)  LONDON (AP) — Global stock markets traded in narrow ranges Monday with positive sentiment weighed down by jitters over developments in Spain’s Catalonia region, tensions over North Korea and mixed U.S. jobs data.  KEEPING SCORE: In Europe, Germany’s DAX was unchanged at 12,960 while France’s CAC-4 was steady at 5,360. London’s FTSE 100 was down at 0.2 percent at 7,505. U.S. stocks were poised for a solid opening with Dow futures and the broader S&P 500 futures up 0.2 percent. Trading on Wall Street is expected to be muted with much of the country on a public holiday.  U.S. JOBS: The U.S. economy lost 33,000 jobs last month as hiring fell due to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, but the Labor Department said the unemployment rate fell to a 16-year low. It was the first monthly employment loss in nearly seven years, but economists said weakness is likely to be short-lived as the country rebounds from the storms. Previous disasters such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 inflicted short-term job losses that were followed by intensified hiring.  GEOPOLITICS: Ongoing geopolitical considerations are also working to keep sentiment in the markets in check. Investors are monitoring a raft of developments that have the potential to flare up and jolt markets. These include North Korea’s missile program and the political uncertainty surrounding the Spanish region of Catalonia following last week’s disputed independence referendum.  ANALYST TAKE: “Whether it’s fears of another North Korean missile, Catalan secession, a U.S.-Turkey visa spat, German coalition talks or Brexit/Westminster uncertainty, there’s plenty to keep markets amused while stateside trading is quiet on account of the Columbus day holiday,” said Mike van Dulken, head of Research at Accendo Markets.  ASIA’S DAY: The Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.8 percent to 3,374.38 and Sydney’s S&P ASX 200 gained 0.5 percent to 5,739.30. Markets in Japan and South Korea were closed for holidays.

Dove is facing heat for the ad and said Saturday, Oct. 7, 2017, that it regrets the offense caused by the ad. The company said it ""missed the mark in representing women of color thoughtfully."" (Twitter via AP)  NEW YORK (AP) — Dove is facing heat for a body wash ad showing a black woman taking off her shirt to reveal a white woman, with many social media users calling it racist.  Dove has removed the post from its Facebook page and posted comments on social media Saturday saying it “missed the mark in representing women of color thoughtfully.” In an emailed statement Sunday, Dove said the ad, a three-second video clip, “did not represent the diversity of real beauty which is something Dove is passionate about and is core to our beliefs, and it should not have happened ... we apologize deeply and sincerely for the offense that it has caused.”  The ad was a gif showing a black woman taking off her brown shirt to reveal a white woman, who then took off her lighter-colored shirt, revealing a woman of color in a slightly darker shirt.  While that post has been taken down, there are screenshots from the ad circulating broadly online. One is a group of four images from the ad that show only the black woman turning into the white woman.  Social media users said there were racist implications of a soap ad that showed a black woman transforming into a white woman. Many who criticized the imagery said it suggests black skin is dirty and white skin is clean, and noted there is a historical legacy of racism in soap ads.  “Dove’s marketing team is fundamentally racist. A clean body is not a white body. Black bodies aren’t systematically dirty,” wrote Abigail Sewell, 34, a sociology professor at Emory University in Atlanta, on Facebook. “I’ve used their products forever, but it’s time to move on.”  It’s not the first time Dove has been criticized for being racially insensitive in an ad. A 2011 ad that showed two women of color and a white woman standing in front of “before” and “after” signs was also criticized .  Dove, which is owned by British-Dutch company Unilever, has long had an ad campaign that highlights women’s diversity.",3.1367521367521367,468,"[2.0, 1.5, 4.5, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 1.5, 5.0, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 1.5, 4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 2.0, 4.5, 4.0, 2.5, 2.0, 2.0, 4.5, 2.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 2.5, 5.0, 3.5, 2.5, 3.0, 5.0, 1.0, 5.0, 2.5, 5.0, 1.5, 1.5, 5.0, 4.0, 1.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.0, 4.5, 2.5, 2.0, 4.5, 1.5, 0.5, 0.5, 3.0, 5.0, 0.5, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 1.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5, 1.5, 4.0, 4.0, 1.0, 4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 0.5, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 2.5, 2.5, 4.5, 0.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.0, 1.5, 2.0, 5.0, 0.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 1.0, 3.5, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.0, 0.5, 3.0, 4.5, 2.5, 1.0, 3.5, 0.5, 4.5, 3.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 0.5, 4.5, 2.0, 3.5, 3.5, 2.0, 3.5, 1.5, 4.0, 4.0, 2.5, 1.5, 2.5, 4.5, 5.0, 0.5, 5.0, 5.0, 0.5, 3.0, 3.5, 1.0, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 0.5, 0.5, 4.0, 0.5, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 5.0, 0.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 0.5, 5.0, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 0.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.0, 2.0, 3.5, 3.5, 0.5, 2.5, 5.0, 2.5, 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 4.0, 3.5, 2.5, 4.0, 2.5, 1.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 0.5, 2.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.0, 2.5, 4.5, 1.5, 0.5, 2.5, 5.0, 2.0, 3.5, 3.5, 3.0, 1.5, 4.0, 1.5, 3.5, 4.5, 2.0, 1.5, 4.0, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 2.5, 5.0, 4.0, 1.5, 3.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 3.5, 2.5, 4.5, 0.5, 2.5, 5.0, 0.5, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 0.5, 5.0, 4.5, 2.5, 1.0, 2.5, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 0.5, 2.5, 1.5, 0.5, 4.0, 4.5, 1.5, 5.0, 4.5, 5.0, 2.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 4.5, 2.5, 2.0, 4.5, 2.5, 4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 1.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 3.5, 1.5, 5.0, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5, 1.0, 5.0, 5.0, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 1.5, 0.5, 5.0, 2.5, 4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 1.5, 0.5, 0.5, 5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 2.0, 3.5, 4.5, 3.0, 4.5, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 5.0, 3.5, 0.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.0, 2.5, 0.5, 2.0, 0.5, 5.0, 3.5, 5.0, 2.5, 5.0, 2.5, 1.0, 3.0, 3.5, 2.5, 5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 1.5, 0.5, 4.0, 2.5, 3.0, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 0.5, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.5, 5.0, 2.5, 3.0, 0.5, 1.5, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 4.5, 2.0, 2.5, 4.5, 4.5, 2.0, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 0.5, 0.5, 2.5, 1.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 3.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.0, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5, 5.0, 0.5, 1.5, 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 3.0, 1.5, 4.5, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 5.0, 0.5, 0.5, 3.5, 1.5, 4.5, 2.5, 4.5, 1.5, 3.5, 0.5, 5.0, 3.5, 2.5, 2.5, 3.0, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 4.5, 3.0, 0.5, 4.0, 4.0, 1.5, 4.5, 1.0, 4.0, 3.5, 0.5, 4.0, 4.0, 4.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 3.0, 0.5, 2.0, 3.5, 4.0, 3.0, 4.5, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 2.5, 4.0, 5.0, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 4.5]"
425,1770,10,8,2017,2017-10-08,Associated Press News,Tourism drop means Harvey still punishing Texas beach towns," Born and raised in this Texas Gulf Coast beach town, James Wheeler Jr. finds himself sawing plywood and hanging sheet rock at a time when he would normally be leading deep-sea fishing excursions, trying to hook tuna or Spanish mackerel by the cooler-full.  Since Hurricane Harvey came through Port Aransas just before Labor Day — damaging or destroying 80 percent of homes and business and wiping out the lucrative summer season’s final weeks — the 38-year-old boat captain has become an amateur builder, working to repair the roof of a sea headquarters building where he and others dock their pleasure crafts.  “Port Aransas is built on the tourist dollar,” said Wheeler, ticking off attractions besides fishing: surfing, nature reserves, seafood restaurants and beaches where it’s always cocktail hour. “That dollar’s not coming right now.”  In many Texas seaside enclaves, the owners of bars and eateries, inns and T-shirt shops are facing a painful paradox: Tourists who are their economic lifeblood likely won’t return until the rebuild is in full swing, but picking up the pieces after Harvey may not truly begin without the profits tourists bring.  “That’s the risk,” said David Teel, president of the Texas Travel Industry Association. “The recovery will come. But it will never be fast enough for these folks.”  Insurance money and support from federal grants will help residents rebuild homes and businesses, and in some cases even cover businesses’ lost income and employees’ lost wages. But that will pale in comparison to what tourists would normally be spending, likely helping ensure that recovery moves more slowly.  Locals expect the normally busy Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s holidays to be slow. Even the possibility of getting back to business by spring break looks bleak.  Visitors to Texas’ Gulf Coast spent $18.7 billion last year, according to state estimates, and the region’s tourism industry employed 170,000-plus people. Visitors spent $221 million in 2016 just in Port Aransas, a onetime fishing village that’s now home to around 4,000 full-time residents.  In other years, October is when “Winter Texans” — part-time residents from colder locales — take up temporary residence, while shorter-term tourists come for the weekends. The influx of people is normally enough to keep the economy robust through the holidays and until spring.  Wheeler says he’d usually be organizing large fishing trips nearly every day, but now takes just one smaller excursion a week.  “It’s not that no one wants to come,” Wheeler said. “There’s just nowhere for them to stay yet.”  Drivers entering Port Aransas encounter bulldozers tearing into a roadside mountain of debris more than three-stories high. Power company and internet provider vans are everywhere, as crews repair infrastructure. Golf carts — a favored mode of local transportation — have to avoid shattered glass and mangled light poles. They’re more likely, these days, to be filled with Salvation Army personnel or construction crews than tourists hitting the beach.  “We are Port A Proud and on the Rebound,” proclaims the website of the chamber of commerce, whose office was damaged. It lists six local hotels planning to be open by Christmas.  Sweeping dust out of the gutted Destination Beach and Surf store, Olya Soya said some regular visitors have come as volunteers helping to rebuild, while others simply gawk at Harvey’s wrath.  “They want to see what it looks like now. It’s very different,” said Soya, 24, who instead of working in the air-conditioned store sweats through her days on a makeshift debris removal crew. Beside her is a towering plaster shark that survived the storm despite extensive damage to the store it guarded.  Harvey’s eye passed directly over nearby Rockport, where operators hope to have 500 hotel rooms available by November — down from 1,500 pre-Harvey.  “Yes, we’re open for business. But please be patient,” said Diane Probst, president of the local chamber of commerce, adding that visitors should expect frustratingly slow debris removal.  Back in Port Aransas, dozens of restaurants and businesses have reopened, at least part time. One shop, Gratitude, suffered only light damage, despite being crammed with fragile keepsakes and knickknacks such as wind chimes and oversized wine glasses proclaiming “Summer is for mimosas and mermaids.”  “You almost feel guilty opening because there are a lot of stores and places that can’t,” said owner Sally Marco, 60. “But it’s nice to have people smile when they come in.”  One bright spot is that area beaches didn’t suffer major ill-effects. On a recent, balmy Saturday, seagulls and pelicans outnumbered the few surfers, children splashing in the waves and couples strolling on the sand with dogs.  “As these communities begin to open back up — and little pieces will open — the good part about it is, they’ve got a beach,” said Teel, of the state tourist association. “And it’s a great beach.”  ___  Sign up for the AP’s weekly newsletter showcasing our best reporting from the Midwest and Texas: http://apne.ws/2u1RMfv",3.738425925925926,216,"[5.0, 2.5, 4.5, 2.5, 5.0, 3.5, 0.5, 3.5, 3.0, 2.5, 4.5, 1.5, 3.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.0, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.0, 2.5, 2.5, 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 2.5, 2.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 0.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 3.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 5.0, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 0.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.0, 1.5, 4.0, 4.5, 2.5, 5.0, 0.5, 4.5, 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.0, 3.0, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0, 3.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 3.5, 5.0, 4.0, 4.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 2.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 2.5, 4.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0, 2.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 3.5, 1.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 4.5, 1.0, 3.0, 4.5, 3.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.0, 5.0, 3.0, 5.0, 3.5, 1.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 5.0, 4.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.0, 0.5, 4.5, 3.0, 2.0, 4.5, 1.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.0, 4.5, 5.0, 4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 5.0, 4.0, 4.5, 3.0, 4.5, 5.0, 2.5, 5.0, 4.0, 1.5, 5.0, 4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.0, 1.0, 5.0, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0, 3.0, 3.5, 3.0, 2.5, 4.5, 1.5, 3.0, 2.5, 1.0, 3.5, 5.0]"

Worried California vintners surveyed the damage to their vineyards and wineries Tuesday after wildfires swept through several counties whose famous names have become synonymous with fine food and drink. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg)  SONOMA, Calif. (AP) — Worried California vintners surveyed the damage to their vineyards and wineries Tuesday as wildfires sweep through counties whose famous names have become synonymous with fine food and drink.  At the Gundlach Bundschu in Sonoma County, workers were not sure the grapes above the winery survived a second night of fires that have destroyed at least two wineries and damaged more.  “We haven’t been able to go up and assess the vine damage,” said Katie Bundschu, vice president of sales. “We’re in the process of salvaging what we can.”  Speedy, wind-driven wildfires that continued to burn Tuesday came as workers in Napa and Sonoma counties were picking and processing ripe grapes to make chardonnay, merlot and other wines that have made the region a global hot spot. Millions of locals and out-of-staters flock to the counties every year to sample wine, sit in mud baths and soak in the region’s natural beauty.  At least five wineries belonging to members have had “complete losses” in facilities, with another nine reporting some damage, said Michael Honig, board chairman of the Napa Valley Vintners trade association and president of Honig Vineyard & Winery. He said the group has not heard from all members, especially those in the most vulnerable parts of the valley.  “We don’t have a good idea of how the vineyards have been impacted,” he said. “The silver lining, if there is one to this fire, this situation, is that most of us have brought in 90 percent of our crop for 2017, so the vast majority of the crops have been picked.”  Most of the remaining fruit, he said, are thicker-skinned cabernet sauvignon grapes that won’t be affected by smoke.  Bundschu, a sixth-generation vintner, recounted a scary Monday night in which the flames licked at the perimeter of the winery but were beaten back by firefighters. A century-old redwood barn and her grandmother’s 1919 home were spared.  Gundlach Bundschu is the oldest family-run winery in California, started in 1858.  She was eager to dispel reports that the winery had been destroyed, as was Nicholson Ranch winery, also in Sonoma County, which posted on Facebook that news of its demise was premature.  “The winery was in the path of the fire but escaped being engulfed by the flames. We have some damage to fix. The wine is secure in our cellars. We are cleaning up and hoping to have the power back on this week,” it said.  Even wineries that were destroyed may survive. Melted and blackened wine bottles littered the ruined Signorello Estate winery in Napa Valley, but its vineyard looked untouched by flames.  Spokeswoman Charlotte Milan said she could only confirm damage to the winery and a residence, explaining that workers had not been able to go on site. She said the estate’s 2015 reds and 2016 whites were stored off-site.  The Paradise Ridge Winery in Sonoma County posted Monday that it was “heartbroken” to announce that the facility had burned.  About 12 percent of grapes grown in California are in Sonoma, Napa and surrounding counties, said Anita Oberholster, a cooperative extension specialist in enology at the University of California, Davis. But they are the highest value grapes that yield the most expensive wines, she said.  She was optimistic that the fires will not affect the wines to come out of this year’s harvest. Smoke would have to be heavy and sustained to do much damage and even then, she said, the harm would be limited to the fruit, not the vines or soil.  That means next year’s crop should be unharmed, Oberholster said.  Tourism officials said Tuesday that wine country is open for business.  Sara Brooks, chairwoman of the Visit Napa Valley Board of Directors and general manager of the historic Napa River Inn, said she has had some cancellations, but expects tourism to bounce back as it did after the 2014 Napa earthquake.  Honig said the next few days might not be the best time to sample wines, but he wants people to visit in a week or two. He is convinced the Napa brand will survive.  “We’ve suffered with pests, fires, drought,” he said. “We made it through Prohibition. This is a short-term setback.”  ___  Har reported from San Francisco.  ___  Follow the AP’s complete wildfire coverage here: https://apnews.com/tag/Wildfires .",4.090163934426229,61,"[4.5, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 2.0, 5.0, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 3.0, 4.0, 3.5, 3.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.0, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0, 4.5, 3.5, 1.5, 4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.0, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 5.0, 2.5, 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 5.0, 5.0, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 4.0]"

Share prices were mixed in early trading Tuesday in Asia, after the rally on Wall Street took a breather overnight. Investors are awaiting trade data from China this week and keeping an eye on geopolitical risks centered on North Korea. (AP Photo/Koji Sasahara)  LONDON (AP) — Global share indexes traded in narrow ranges Tuesday as geopolitical concerns, not least relating to developments in the Spanish region of Catalonia, kept sentiment in check, particularly in Madrid where the main index was down sharply.  KEEPING SCORE: In Europe, Germany’s DAX slipped 0.1 percent to 12,963 while the CAC 40 of France was flat at 5,364. Britain’s FTSE 100 added 0.2 percent to 7,524. The big faller was Spain’s IBEX which was down 1.1 percent at 10,125. U.S. stocks were poised for a flat opening with Dow futures and the broader S&P 500 futures up 0.1 percent.  CATALAN SITUATION: Investors around the world are keeping a close watch in developments in Spain following last week’s disputed referendum in Catalonia. All eyes will be on Catalan President Carles Puigdemont, who is due to make a pronouncement later. He hasn’t revealed the precise message he will deliver in a 6 p.m. (1600GMT) session in the region’s parliament, but separatist politicians have said they expect a declaration based on the results of the disputed Oct. 1 independence referendum. The Catalan government has said the results of the referendum, showing a 90 percent victory for those favoring independence with a turnout of 43 percent of eligible voters, are valid. The Spanish government says the vote was illegal and is vowing to prevent independence from taking place.  ANALYST TAKE: “Once again, the Spanish IBEX is lagging behind its peers in Europe as speculation that Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont may be preparing to declare independence today continues to grow,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA. “The uncertainty is weighing heavily on risk appetite but it currently only appears to be directly impacting Spanish assets, with the euro showing little or no sign of being negatively affected.”  CURRENCIES: The euro was up 0.4 percent at $1.1782 while the dollar fell 0.2 percent to 112.43 yen.  ASIA’S DAY: Asian markets meandered higher during the day, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 index gained 0.6 percent to 20,823.51, its highest close in over 21 years.

The business and its labor practices are under investigation by Brazilian authorities, just one of several inquiries launched into a pair of Brazilian churches connected to Word of Faith Fellowship, a secretive evangelical sect based in Spindale, North Carolina. (AP Photo/Andre Penner)  RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Every day before work, Liliane Souza says, she and three dozen fellow workers at a Brazilian picture-framing factory affiliated with the Word of Faith Fellowship church were obligated to pray.  When workers made a mistake, such as cutting a frame too short, she says they were screamed at and sometimes even hit to expunge the “devil” behind the error. And when Stylofino stopped paying its workers for months, Souza said the company’s co-owners — members of a Brazilian branch of the U.S.-based church — had a ready explanation.  “They said the business was struggling because we were sinners,” she said.  The business and its labor practices are under investigation by Brazilian authorities — just one of several inquiries launched into a pair of churches connected to Word of Faith Fellowship, a secretive evangelical sect based in Spindale, North Carolina.  The Associated Press has learned that Brazilian prosecutors also are looking into possible improprieties in a land deal involving one of the churches. And education ministries in two Brazilian states said they are investigating allegations that church schools physically and psychologically abused students and redacted textbooks in violation of state policy.  The investigations were spurred by AP stories in July detailing allegations that Word of Faith Fellowship created a pipeline of young congregants who say they were brought to the U.S. from Brazil and forced to work at church-affiliated businesses for little or no pay. The stories also documented how the church steadily took over the two Brazilian congregations, instituting a fundamentalist vision that included verbal and physical abuse aimed at expelling devils.  Pastors at the Word of Faith Fellowship branches — located in the Brazilian cities of Sao Joaquim de Bicas and Franco da Rocha — have issued statements denying the accusations, but did not respond to numerous interview requests from the AP.  After the stories about the Brazilian churches were published in July, authorities in both Brazil and the United States launched investigations into the allegations of abuse, forced labor and visa fraud. Investigators told the AP that interviews stemming from that ongoing probe led them to scrutinize the conditions at Stylofino.  The small factory in the Sao Paulo suburb of Franco da Rocha was opened in 2000 by Gerson Jose Garcia and Juarez de Souza Oliveira, according to tax records.  De Souza Oliveira and wife Solange Granieri founded Ministerio Evangelico Comunidade Rhema, or Rhema Community Evangelical Ministry, in 1988. Garcia is a long-time member of the church, which includes an adjoining school.  Eight former factory workers interviewed by the AP described a rigid working environment that mirrored the religious fervor of the church and school. Only members of the church could work there: Leaving the church meant leaving the job.  The employees said they were paid minimum wage and worked most national holidays, late at night and on weekends, but never were paid overtime. They were pressured into signing falsified time sheets that reflected vacations never taken and only the limited hours they were supposed to be working, they said.  They also said they were not provided lunch stipends or allowed to sell a portion of their holidays for pay, both of which are mandated by Brazilian law.  Three of the former workers said they began part time while in high school, working off the books as “volunteers” for no compensation.  Andre Oliveira said he started at the factory in 2007 while still in high school and continued into 2009 about eight months after graduating, working almost every day from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. for no pay.  “I never received even a cent,” said Oliviera, who broke with the church last year and now lives in the United States.  He said he feared that refusing to work would have led to being kicked out of church or “blasting,” a practice in which followers surround a congregant and scream, often for hours.  The workers told the AP that, beginning in 2011, many employees were not paid their regular salaries for more than a year, instead receiving payments months late or just a portion of what they were owed. Employees who complained or said they needed money to pay bills were more likely to get paid, the former members said.  They said the owners blamed the suspension of salaries on the factory having money problems due to workers sinning. Prayer increased, they said, and anybody who questioned what was going on was subjected to blasting.  “They would say, ’A demon took you over! You are out of your mind!” said a former worker who left the church and factory in 2012 and recently gave testimony to federal police. The worker asked not to be identified because of relatives still in the church.  Inside the factory, “They would put you in a chair and people would pray for you. They would shake you, hit you in the face,” the worker said.  Requests for comment left at the home of Granieri and de Souza Oliveira, on Garcia’s cellphone and via Stylofino’s website were not returned.  On Aug. 3, federal police and labor investigators from Brazil’s Justice Department raided the church and school in Franco da Rocha, gathering records and beginning a series of interviews, an official who was not authorized to speak publicly and insisted on anonymity told the AP. The official said that investigators also visited Stylofino the same day, conducting interviews and gathering records.  A woman who answered the phone at Stylofino said the business no longer operated as a factory, but declined to answer further questions. Repeated knocks on the factory door were not answered, and a “for rent” sign was posted outside.  In the course of interviews, former members also told investigators about a deal in which church leaders in the Franco da Rocha branch ended up with ownership of land that initially had been bought in the church’s name. Police inspector Felipe Carbonari confirmed to the AP that an investigation was under way but would provide no details.  The church and school sit adjacent on a large plot that backs up onto a street, with a high fence blocking any outside view. In 1999, the church bought two adjoining parcels for 47,000 reales (then $24,700), according to records reviewed by the AP.  The land was bought with money saved by the congregation over three years by the usual tithing of 10 percent and a number of targeted fundraisers, according to six former long-time members who broke with the church in the past year.  The plan was to build a pastoral home that would house the church leadership and serve as a center of activities, a common practice among Brazilian churches, they said. A home on one of the plots was renovated and Granieri and de Souza Oliveira live there today.  In 2006, the pastors themselves also became the properties’ legal owners, with a seven-member board set up to manage the land, documents show. The records show Granieri was named president and de Souza Oliveira vice president, with four of the remaining board slots filled out by the couple’s relatives.  The former members interviewed by the AP said they were furious when they learned of the property transfers only this year.  “We all worked to buy those lands,” said Flavio Correa, who left the church last year after 25 years and recently provided testimony to investigators. “When you see something like this with people you trusted, it’s like the world is crashing around you.”  Meanwhile, education agencies in both states with Word of Faith Fellowship branches have launched investigations into the churches’ schools.  In its July stories, the AP reported that students were sometimes subjected to the same harsh treatment that church members received, ranging from blasting to sustained isolation. The stories also detailed how textbooks ranging from life sciences to geography were heavily redacted. For example, a photo of a woman applying makeup in a social sciences book was covered completely, as were the genitals of a man in an anatomy book.  Inspectors have found several cases of censorship that violated school regulations and also infringed on authors’ intellectual rights, according to Webster Silvino de Oliveira, the school superintendent whose district includes Sao Joaquim de Bicas.  De Oliveira said the district would initially look to “correct and monitor” the situation without issuing fines or revoking the school’s license, and that accusations of abuse would be passed on to law enforcement. He declined to discuss specifics of anything found to date.  The superintendent overseeing the school in Franco da Rocha did not respond to interview requests.  Allegations of abuse in the schools are widespread among former members.  Maria Reis said her now 15-year-old son was frequently screamed at and segregated from other students because he had trouble learning. She pulled her son from the school last year and left the church in Franco da Rocha after being a follower for 23 years.  Reis said her decision to break with Word of Faith Fellowship came after she broached the school issue with church founder Jane Whaley, who was visiting Brazil for a wedding.  ″‘You are a rebel. You are going against God,’” Reis recalled Whaley telling her. “I came to the conclusion there was no gospel in this church. The objective was just to control people.”  ____  Associated Press reporter Stan Lehman in Franco da Rocha contributed to this report.  ____  Follow Peter Prengaman: twitter.com/peterprengaman",2.933333333333333,60,"[4.0, 1.0, 5.0, 2.5, 4.5, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 2.0, 5.0, 3.5, 2.5, 2.0, 2.5, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 1.5, 2.5, 0.5, 5.0, 0.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5, 0.5, 1.5, 4.0, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 5.0, 1.5, 0.5, 3.0, 0.5, 4.5, 0.5, 5.0, 2.5, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 3.0, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.5, 2.5, 1.5, 2.5, 1.5]"

Bob Corker, R-Tenn., speaks to the Sevier County Chamber of Commerce in Sevierville, Tenn. Always one to speak his mind, Corker’s new free agent status should make President Donald Trump and the GOP very nervous. The two-term Tennessee Republican isn’t seeking re-election. And that gives him even more elbow room to say what he wants and vote how he pleases over the next 15 months as Trump and the party’s top leaders on Capitol Hill struggle to get their agenda on track (AP Photo/Erik Schelzig, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump lashed out at Sen. Bob Corker as “Liddle’ Bob Corker” on Tuesday, escalating a feud with the Tennessee Republican who’s dubbed the White House an “adult day care center” and charged that Trump could be setting the nation on the path toward World War III.  Fellow GOP senators, treading carefully, avoided siding with Trump or with Corker. But leading lawmakers called on both men to end a quarrel that could imperil the Republican agenda on Capitol Hill. Trump will need Corker if he is to get big tax changes through the Senate, where the narrow GOP majority was unable to repeal Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. And Corker also figures to be a key player if Trump moves as expected to unwind the Iran nuclear deal.  “I have a lot of respect for Sen. Corker and what he brings to the Senate, but I think the president is leading in the right direction and I’m supportive of what he’s doing,” Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, a member of the GOP leadership, told reporters Tuesday at the Capitol. “I would encourage them both to stop what they’re doing and get focused on what we need to be doing.”  Sen. Cory Gardner, another high-ranking Republican, issued a similar plea to reporters at home in Colorado.  “I’m not going to get in the middle of this fight, but I don’t think it’s helpful to have finger-pointing and name-calling on either side,” Gardner said. “We need to have people focusing on one thing and one thing only, and that’s what we’re going to do to create more opportunity for the American people.”  Trump’s tweet Tuesday alleged that Corker was “set up” by “the failing” New York Times in a recorded interview Sunday. Corker, who is not running for re-election, leveled searing criticism at Trump in the interview and said the president’s conduct “would have to concern anyone who cares about our nation.” Corker also said that Trump could set the U.S. “on the path to World War III” with threats toward other countries.  Trump responded to that charge Tuesday as he addressed reporters in the Oval Office while meeting with Henry Kissinger.  “We were on the wrong path before,” Trump said. “All you have to do is take a look. If you look over the last 25 years, through numerous administrations, we were on a path to a very big problem, a problem like this world has never seen. We’re on the right path right now, believe me.”  Trump also disputed the suggestion that his spat with Corker would affect his efforts to pass tax reform.  “I don’t think so, no, I don’t think so at all,” he said in response to a reporter’s question. “I think we’re well in our way.”  Earlier, Trump took to Twitter to voice his grievances over Corker’s New York Times interview, belittling the senator’s relatively short stature and writing that Corker “was made to sound a fool, and that’s what I am dealing with!” Corker’s office declined to respond, but a Times spokeswoman, Danielle Rhoades Ha, said “the interview with Sen. Corker was on the record and he knew it was being recorded.”  The Failing @nytimes set Liddle’ Bob Corker up by recording his conversation. Was made to sound a fool, and that’s what I am dealing with! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 10, 2017  Corker’s comments echoed what some Republicans say privately, and drew public backing from another Republican who’s announced his retirement, Rep. Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, who said more Republicans should be willing to speak out against Trump.  “What I believe Republicans should do in Congress is this: Work constructively with him and support him when he’s on the right track, check him when he’s moving in a bad direction, and call him out if he makes outlandish statements or offensive statements,” Dent said.  But Trump’s enduring popularity with a segment of the GOP base serves as a political muzzle that keeps most elected Republicans from saying anything similar, even those who believe it to be true.  And Trump still has plenty of loyalists on Capitol Hill, several of whom voiced displeasure with Corker’s remarks. Corker’s fellow Tennessean, Rep. Diane Black, said in an interview on the “Hugh Hewitt Show” on Tuesday that “if you talk about an adult daycare center, I’m sorry, but I think the Senate is an adult daycare center. They can’t get anything done over there.”  “We have been waiting for repeal and replace,” Black said, referring to the Senate’s failure to pass legislation to undo the Affordable Care Act after the House passed its own version. The Senate’s failure on health care has also led Trump to attack Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in the past.  Former top Trump adviser Steve Bannon lashed out at Corker, McConnell and others in an interview with conservative host Sean Hannity late Monday, calling on Corker to resign and threatening to take out incumbent GOP senators in primaries.  “We are declaring war on the Republican establishment,” Bannon said on Fox News.  “Sen. Corker is an absolute disgrace,” he said. “If Bob Corker has any honor, any decency, he should resign immediately.”  ___  Associated Press writer Dan Elliott in Denver contributed.

Pence visited Southern California on Monday to raise money for endangered Republican congressional candidates, hoping to foil Democrats' hopes of retaking the House next year. (Randy Pench/The Sacramento Bee via AP)  NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. (AP) — Vice President Mike Pence traveled up California on Monday to raise money for endangered Republican congressional candidates and tout the Trump administration’s proposal for cutting taxes.  It was the first visit to the heavily Democratic state by a member of the Trump-Pence ticket since the November election, when Democrat Hillary Clinton won the state by more than 4 million votes. Pence jetted from a Southern California fundraiser costing $2,700 for lunch at a luxury resort to Northern California for a hotel dinner in Sacramento alongside U.S. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy.  In between, he toured a small manufacturing company just outside of the capital to promote a tax plan he said would ease filing for 90 percent of families and lower taxes for small businesses.  He predicted an improved economy would help Republican candidates hold their ground in California and promised quick action on tax reform. The plan would, among other things, lower the corporate tax rate to 20 percent and raise the standard deduction, Pence said.  “We’re going to get this done, and we’re going to get this done this year,” he said, making no mention of President Donald Trump’s struggle to see other priorities such as health care reform pass through Congress.  Pence deviated little from the topics at hand, making no mention at the business tour of the president’s recent spat with GOP Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee or his own decision to leave an NFL game on Sunday when players kneeled during the national anthem. He did, though, pledge federal assistance as Northern California battles deadly wire fires near the Napa and Sonoma wine countries, although it was unclear if he was promising to answer Gov. Jerry Brown’s request for a federal disaster declaration.  “We’ll be working very closely with Gov. Brown and California to see you through these challenging times,” Pence said.  Pence arrived Sunday in Los Angeles for a three-day swing through the state, and he’ll head back to Southern California on Tuesday.  California has long been a source of campaign dollars for both major political parties. Pence’s money-raising efforts were aimed at boosting Republicans, who are seen as key targets in the Democrats quest to retake the U.S. House of Representatives in 2018.  Democrats are targeting seven California Republicans who hold seats in districts carried by Clinton in last year’s presidential campaign. Clinton trounced Trump in the strongly Democratic state, and Democrats are hoping opposition to the president’s environmental, immigration and health care policies in California will drive voters to the polls next year.  Several of those competitive seats are in Orange County, once a Republican fortress where Democrats have been steadily increasing their numbers.  House members who attended the Newport Beach fundraiser included Reps. Darrell Issa, Mimi Walters, Dana Rohrabacher and Ed Royce, said Republican National Committeeman Shawn Steel, who hosted the event.  Republicans “want to build a firewall” in California, undercutting Democratic chances of retaking the House in 2018, Steel said.  “The Democrats think that they have an opportunity in California. It’s a bad bet,” Steel added.  California has waged repeated battles against the Trump administration this year, particularly on immigration and the environment. State Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a former member of Congress, has sued over the administration’s numerous attempts to roll back environmental regulations and last week Brown signed legislation that limits the ability of California police to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.  __  Associated Press writer Michael R.

459,1816,10,10,2017,2017-10-10,Associated Press News,APNewsBreak: Billions in Illinois bills not sent for payment," In this June 14, 2017, file photo, Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza, speaks during an interview in Chicago. A review of Illinois' $16 billion pile of overdue bills by Mendoza shows that likely half haven't been submitted for processing, and there's no way of knowing whether there's even authority to pay. (AP Photo/G-Jun Yam File)  SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) — Illinois is chasing a moving target as it tries to dig out of the nation’s worst budget crisis, and a review obtained by The Associated Press shows $7.5 billion worth of unpaid bills — as much as half the total — hadn’t been sent to the official who writes the checks by the end of June.  Although many of those IOUs have since been paid, a similar amount in unprocessed bills has replaced them in the last three months, Comptroller Susana Mendoza’s office said Monday. That’s in addition to $9 billion worth of checks that are at the office but being delayed because the state lacks the money to pay them.  The mound of past-due bills tripled over the two years Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and Democrats who control the General Assembly were locked in a budget stalemate, which ended in July when lawmakers hiked income taxes over Rauner’s vetoes.  In some cases, agencies were waiting to send their receipts to Mendoza because lawmakers haven’t approved the spending. For example, the Department of Corrections had $471 million in unpaid bills on hand as of June 30 largely for that reason.  “Ascertaining the precise nature of the state’s past-due obligations and liabilities is an essential component of responsible cash and debt management,” the Democratic comptroller wrote in a letter to Republican Rep. David McSweeney, a budget hawk from Barrington Hills who requested the review.  Mendoza and McSweeney plan to use the findings to urge lawmakers to override Rauner’s veto of legislation that would require monthly reporting of bills not yet submitted for processing. The measure, authored by Mendoza’s office, would include a breakdown of how old each bill is and which ones have received legislative approval to be paid.  “The governor supports more transparency on the state of our finances,” Rauner spokesman Hud Englehart said in an email to AP. “He vetoed this bill because the State does not have adequate technology in place to cost effectively provide this information monthly.”  The age of bills is important because many that are 90 days or older face a 1 percent-per-month late-payment fee; about $5.5 billion of the current $15.9 billion backlog is subject to the penalty. Mendoza estimates the state will ultimately pay $900 million in late-payment fees on the existing pile of debt.  The Department of Central Management Services, which handles personnel, procurement and employee health care, has most of the June 30 bundle, with $5.8 billion. That’s mostly doctor’s bills owed to employee medical providers under the state group health insurance plan.  McSweeney’s call for the overview coincided with the current Oct. 1 deadline for publicizing the amount of bills held at agencies at a fiscal year’s end. McSweeney said with Illinois swimming in debt, including a $130 billion shortfall in what’s needed to pay employee pensions and other long-term borrowing, check-writers need more exact information.  “With a $16 billion backlog of unpaid bills, and $200 billion in total liabilities when you add in the pension debt, I don’t trust this governor, I don’t trust this administration,” McSweeney said. “We need monthly reporting.”  Typically, when a governor and Legislature agree on a budget, the legislation authorizing it includes appropriations bills. If money is spent that isn’t approved, lawmakers must do it after the fact in a supplemental appropriation. Rauner has complained that the budget legislative Democrats approved in July is $1.7 billion short of being balanced. Democrats have countered that the governor spent money last year that wasn’t approved. Neither side has elaborated.  Democrats have signaled they plan to attack Rauner’s budget management during his 2018 re-election campaign  Mendoza, who beat Rauner’s hand-picked candidate in a special election for comptroller last fall, has wrangled with the governor over issues related to the deficit and the backlog, including one spat over which fund to use to pay particular bills.

Scientists say more than 1,000 dirty stuffed old birds from Midwestern museums are helping them better understand a key global warming particle. Researchers found birds from about 100 years ago showed lots more black carbon, often called soot, than just 20 or 30 years later, and more than scientists had thought. That’s important because black carbon is a potent heat-trapping molecule. (Carl Fuldner and Shane DuBay via AP)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Some dirty old birds are helping scientists better understand one of the more baffling climate change mysteries.  University of Chicago researchers Shane DuBay and Carl Fuldner examined 1,347 dead birds in museums in Chicago, Detroit and Pittsburgh, comparing birds from the 1900s and 1910s to birds from decades later.  The difference was black and white.  Feathers of birds in the 1900s were blacker than birds just 20 or 30 years later, suggesting that there was more soot in the atmosphere than scientists originally thought, according to a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  This is important because scientists believe soot, also called black carbon, has an important role in climate change. They know it traps heat, but scientists haven’t been able to study it well because it doesn’t stay in the atmosphere long.  “The problem previously is that there was no way to characterize the particles from this early industrial era,” Fuldner said. “You can’t look at the soot particles coming out of the 1910 manufacturing plant in Joliet, Illinois.”  Black carbon in the air comes from inefficient burning of fossil fuels, especially coal. Some recent studies call it the second most potent greenhouse “molecule” — because unlike the most important, carbon dioxide, it is a solid, not a gas.  The black carbon coating the birds stuffed long ago now give scientists a better record, showing past pollution may have been underestimated, Fuldner and DuBay said. Black carbon emissions dropped around 1930 as homes turned away from coal for heat. Coal was used more and more for manufacturing and electric power, but that produces less soot than burning it in homes for heat, they said.  The study is fascinating to experts who are trying to predict future warming from black carbon.  Some scientists say reducing black carbon emissions may be an easier way to fight climate change than by just reducing carbon dioxide emissions.  Other scientists say the impacts of the study on projections for future warming would likely be modest — at best — in part because black carbon stays in the atmosphere for such a short time.  ___  Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears and his work can be found here .",3.2083333333333335,24,"[4.5, 2.5, 3.0, 1.5, 4.0, 1.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 2.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 1.5, 4.0, 3.5, 2.5, 2.5, 3.5, 1.0, 3.5]"

(AP Photo/Chris O'Meara)  TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — For nearly half her life, Ruby Williams has prayed for her daughter, Brenda: “Lord, let her be alive.”  She’s repeated this prayer tens of thousands of times, starting in the mid-1970s, when she lived in a four-bedroom apartment with her husband and 12 children. Now 89 and a widow, she prays in a modest home near downtown Tampa, where she lives with two of her children.  Brenda, Williams’ third child, has been missing since 1978. Since then, her family has subsisted on slender threads of hope: Maybe Brenda just walked away. Maybe she was living a new life, with a different family. Maybe she’d had a mental break and ended up in some faraway city, confused and living on the streets.  Nearly 40 years later, on a blazingly hot Florida day in August, the Williams family was summoned to the Tampa Police Department.  “It must be news about Brenda,” Williams thought. But she did not accompany two of Brenda’s sisters to the police department. Instead, she stayed home in her darkened living room to pray once more: “Lord, let her be alive.”  Sheila Williams, who idolized her older, glamorous sister, and Sharon Scott, who has searched for leads on Brenda’s disappearance for decades, came to their mother’s home hours later to deliver the news.  Brenda Williams’ family always prayed they would find her alive. But forensics did not bring a happy ending to their 40-year mystery. (Oct. 9)  Ruby Williams clasped her hands tight in her lap. Her children and grandchildren surrounded her. Most everyone sniffled and wiped away tears.

But her sister prodded her: “Let’s go!”  Sheila Williams loves watching the news, and a local segment had caught her attention: Law enforcement and other officials would soon gather for a symposium on cold cases. Maybe, she thought, they’d be able to talk with detectives there about Brenda.  Scott wasn’t convinced, but her baby sister won out. They dug up a faded, photocopied picture of Brenda they hoped to show police.  Once there, however, it became clear the event wasn’t open to the public.

All around them were detectives, forensic scientists, state attorneys, lawyers — and lifelike sculpted busts of the missing and the dead, carved to draw attention to 19 cold cases .  As speeches about Florida’s backlog of 20,000-plus cold cases began, a bust caught Sheila’s eye: an African-American woman with a short afro and big, haunted eyes. It kind of looked like her — and like Brenda.  Sheila gasped and glanced at the photo in her hands. She elbowed her sister, then nudged a police officer next to her.  “Don’t they look the same?” She pointed at the photo, then the bust.  The officer shushed her.  Sheila couldn’t help herself. She walked to the clay sculpture. She held the photo next to the face. Sharon glanced from her sister, to the photo, to the bust and back again. Sheila began to sob.  A detective stepped forward and ushered the women into a room. He swabbed their cheeks for DNA. Perhaps, detectives said, there would be a match. The woman’s body had been found in a patch of scrub brush used as an unauthorized trash dump in 1985 just outside downtown Tampa. Detectives didn’t know her name.  Could it be Brenda?  ___  Brenda grew up in the family’s crowded, chaotic apartment in a Tampa housing project and at 15, gave birth to a baby girl. That didn’t stop her from, as her sisters said, “being wild.”  She had minor brushes with the law and was incarcerated for a spell. When released, she got pregnant again, and at 22, had another girl. But to her family, she was getting her act together. She rented her own apartment a few streets away. Her mom proudly told neighbors that Brenda was finally going to church.  Sheila looked up to Brenda. Perhaps it had something to do with their birthdays — Brenda was born Feb. 1, 1955; Sheila, nine years and 364 days later. Or maybe it was how Brenda loved high heels, listened to The Isley Brothers and became the first Williams girl to drive.  By the time Sheila was 11, she was eager to spend the night at Brenda’s to get away from the chaos at home. But things weren’t always calm at Brenda’s, either. She dated a man who could be violent. When Sheila saw him beating her sister, she ran home to tell the rest of the family so they could defend her.  In April 1978, 22-year-old Brenda headed out for the night. Sheila cared for Brenda’s daughters, then 7 years and 9 months old.  “Don’t open this door for anyone,” Sheila remembers Brenda saying as she swept out of the house in her signature heels.  Brenda met up with Susanie “Cookie” Austin at a party. Austin remembers Brenda bursting in and asking if she wanted to go out on the town.  “I said no,” said Austin, now 61. “I never saw who she was with.”  Austin said she didn’t give much thought to Brenda’s question — the pair went drinking and dancing on occasion — until days later, when Brenda’s daughter knocked on the door.  “Have you seen my mama?” the girl asked.  A chill went through her. Brenda hadn’t come home? “It disturbed me so bad,” Austin said.  Everyone figured Brenda was just in trouble again, but within a day, the family started to worry. They checked everywhere. She wasn’t in jail and hadn’t been arrested. The family recalls calling police but says officers told them that because Brenda was an adult, there wasn’t much they could do unless relatives had evidence she’d been harmed.  Over the next few months, neighbors and friends stopped by the family’s apartment. They’d heard Brenda was in Bradenton. Someone claimed to have spotted her in Sarasota. Perhaps an ex-boyfriend had something to do with her disappearance.  Brenda had seemingly vanished into the humid Tampa air.  ___  Over the years, Sharon had done her own detective work. She knocked on the door of a Fort Lauderdale woman who shares her sister’s name, combed through articles at the library, looked into a tip that Brenda was at a mental health hospital, called detectives every year. She even found a woman in Tampa using her sister’s name and Social Security number.  And yet, Sharon got nowhere.  That never surprised Sheila.  “My sister was black. My sister was in and out of jail. My sister took drugs. Now that I’ve grown up and I’ve lived life and I see how they treat skin color, and we were poor, it didn’t make a difference,” she said recently in her apartment in a different housing project, not far from where she and her siblings were raised. “Brenda was a nobody to them.”  She paused and looked down. “Skin color makes a big difference. I feel like when skin is as dark as ours, things don’t matter. If you’re poor, people don’t listen.” (Tampa police say they have no record of Brenda Williams reported as a missing person in the 1970s but that they would have handled it with care as in any other such case.)  Months after the sisters gave DNA samples, Sheila was still convinced that Brenda was the woman from the sculpted bust — a woman who, they would learn, had been buried in a pauper’s grave in a cemetery a stone’s throw away, the one shaded by moss-draped oaks where their father and grandmother are buried, the one filled with names familiar across the city’s black community.  Sharon still wasn’t so sure.  “Every time I go out of town, I’m looking,” she said. “I’m looking at faces. I’ll stare at somebody who resembles my sister. When I see homeless people, I’ll look, and think, ‘That could be my sister.’”  The first time detectives called the family, about a month after the Tampa event, Sheila learned her feeling had been wrong; it wasn’t Brenda. Police still couldn’t identify the woman from the pauper’s grave, but the DNA tests ruled Brenda out.  After all that — seeing the bust that looked so much like Brenda, giving DNA samples, rehashing the case to reporters — the family was no closer to the truth. Once again, they thought, officials had given up.  But months later, in August, detectives called again.  “We have some findings,” they said. Cryptic, the sisters thought, but they rushed to the police department. It clearly was important — the chief was there. So was the forensic scientist who had exhumed the body they initially thought was Brenda’s.  The detectives talked about the science behind DNA and cold cases while the sisters wondered: What’s taking so long? Why are we here?  Then, the news: The sisters’ DNA was a match with a jawbone found in a Tampa field by a schoolboy in 1986.  After 40 years, Brenda Williams had been found.  ___  “Lord, let her be alive.”  The prayer Ruby Williams had relied on through the years still ran through her mind hours after the meeting, as children and grandchildren with long faces and wet tears filtered in and out of her home.  Brenda’s two daughters were there, now grown women, stunned.  It was a lot to take in, after decades of silence. Police said they don’t know how Brenda died. All they had is the jawbone, which they released to the family. Brenda’s loved ones used it to hold a proper funeral service Sept. 10, even as Hurricane Irma threatened the state.  Brenda had waited 40 years, and they wouldn’t let her wait any longer.  ___  Follow Tamara Lush on Twitter at http://twitter.com/tamaralush .",4.111111111111111,9,"[4.5, 4.0, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0]"

Worried California vintners surveyed the damage to their vineyards and wineries Tuesday after wildfires swept through several counties whose famous names have become synonymous with fine food and drink. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg)  SONOMA, Calif. (AP) — Worried California vintners surveyed the damage to their vineyards and wineries Tuesday as wildfires sweep through counties whose famous names have become synonymous with fine food and drink.  At the Gundlach Bundschu in Sonoma County, workers were not sure the grapes above the winery survived a second night of fires that have destroyed at least two wineries and damaged more.  “We haven’t been able to go up and assess the vine damage,” said Katie Bundschu, vice president of sales. “We’re in the process of salvaging what we can.”  Speedy, wind-driven wildfires that continued to burn Tuesday came as workers in Napa and Sonoma counties were picking and processing ripe grapes to make chardonnay, merlot and other wines that have made the region a global hot spot. Millions of locals and out-of-staters flock to the counties every year to sample wine, sit in mud baths and soak in the region’s natural beauty.  At least five wineries belonging to members have had “complete losses” in facilities, with another nine reporting some damage, said Michael Honig, board chairman of the Napa Valley Vintners trade association and president of Honig Vineyard & Winery. He said the group has not heard from all members, especially those in the most vulnerable parts of the valley.  “We don’t have a good idea of how the vineyards have been impacted,” he said. “The silver lining, if there is one to this fire, this situation, is that most of us have brought in 90 percent of our crop for 2017, so the vast majority of the crops have been picked.”  Most of the remaining fruit, he said, are thicker-skinned cabernet sauvignon grapes that won’t be affected by smoke.  Bundschu, a sixth-generation vintner, recounted a scary Monday night in which the flames licked at the perimeter of the winery but were beaten back by firefighters. A century-old redwood barn and her grandmother’s 1919 home were spared.  Gundlach Bundschu is the oldest family-run winery in California, started in 1858.  She was eager to dispel reports that the winery had been destroyed, as was Nicholson Ranch winery, also in Sonoma County, which posted on Facebook that news of its demise was premature.  “The winery was in the path of the fire but escaped being engulfed by the flames. We have some damage to fix. The wine is secure in our cellars. We are cleaning up and hoping to have the power back on this week,” it said.  Even wineries that were destroyed may survive. Melted and blackened wine bottles littered the ruined Signorello Estate winery in Napa Valley, but its vineyard looked untouched by flames.  Spokeswoman Charlotte Milan said she could only confirm damage to the winery and a residence, explaining that workers had not been able to go on site. She said the estate’s 2015 reds and 2016 whites were stored off-site.  The Paradise Ridge Winery in Sonoma County posted Monday that it was “heartbroken” to announce that the facility had burned.  About 12 percent of grapes grown in California are in Sonoma, Napa and surrounding counties, said Anita Oberholster, a cooperative extension specialist in enology at the University of California, Davis. But they are the highest value grapes that yield the most expensive wines, she said.  She was optimistic that the fires will not affect the wines to come out of this year’s harvest. Smoke would have to be heavy and sustained to do much damage and even then, she said, the harm would be limited to the fruit, not the vines or soil.  That means next year’s crop should be unharmed, Oberholster said.  Tourism officials said Tuesday that wine country is open for business.  Sara Brooks, chairwoman of the Visit Napa Valley Board of Directors and general manager of the historic Napa River Inn, said she has had some cancellations, but expects tourism to bounce back as it did after the 2014 Napa earthquake.  Honig said the next few days might not be the best time to sample wines, but he wants people to visit in a week or two. He is convinced the Napa brand will survive.  “We’ve suffered with pests, fires, drought,” he said. “We made it through Prohibition. This is a short-term setback.”  ___  Har reported from San Francisco.  ___  Follow the AP’s complete wildfire coverage here: https://apnews.com/tag/Wildfires .",3.740740740740741,27,"[3.5, 3.5, 5.0, 2.5, 4.0, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 1.5, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 4.5, 5.0, 3.0, 1.0, 3.5, 4.5, 2.5]"

A new report says on Wednesday, Oct. 11, 2017, China is closing to matching the United States as a top global source of official grants and loans to developing countries. But it says much of Beijing’s financing serves its own economic interests and produces little growth for recipients. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan,File)  BEIJING (AP) — China is close to matching the United States as a source of official grants and loans to developing countries, but much of Beijing’s financing serves its own economic interests and yields scant benefits for recipients, a multinational group of researchers reported Wednesday.  The research by AidData, a lab at the College of William & Mary in Virginia, is the most extensive effort yet to measure official financing by China, which releases few details of its aid flows. That has spurred concern about Beijing’s intentions as it tries to expand its global influence to match China’s status as the world’s second-largest economy.  China gave or lent $354.4 billion in the 15 years ending in 2014 in Africa, Asia and elsewhere, compared with $394.6 billion for the United States, according to AidData. It released a database of Chinese financing, assembled from thousands of sources of information, and a study on its impact by scholars from Harvard University, Germany’s Heidelberg University and William & Mary.  “At the very top level, you could say the U.S. and China are now spending rivals when it comes to their financial transfers to other countries,” said AidData’s executive director, Bradley C. Parks.  China’s secretiveness about its spending has fueled complaints its aid might prop up corrupt regimes or undercut environmental and human rights standards Western donors are trying to enforce.  Attention to Chinese financing has increased as Beijing promotes its “Belt and Road Initiative,” a multibillion-dollar initiative to expand China’s trade links with Asia, Africa and the Middle East by building ports, roads and other facilities.  About 23 percent of Chinese spending met the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s definition of aid, or “official development assistance,” which requires at least 25 percent of a transfer to be a grant. By contrast, 93 percent of U.S. spending qualifies as aid.  The bulk of Beijing’s financing appears to be export credits and other measures aimed at promoting Chinese exports or other goals, which produced little measurable growth in recipient economies, according to Parks. He said such “official finance” doesn’t count as development assistance but is part of the OECD’s broader definition of aid.  “The lion’s share of the portfolio is really not delivering, at least on average, any significant economic growth benefits for its partner countries,” said Parks.  That leaves Beijing room to have a positive impact by shifting spending to development assistance, he said.  “There still is a lot of scope for them to learn and adapt,” said Parks.  The portion of Chinese financing that qualifies as aid “substantially improves economic growth,” according to the report. It said results were comparable to the impact of U.S.- and other Western-financed projects.  “I thought that was a pretty important finding and an encouraging one,” said Parks.  The 5-year-old project used a computerized system to look for information from more than 15,000 sources including news reports, Chinese government offices, ministries of other countries and academic reports. Its data cover 4,304 projects in 138 countries and territories.  China doesn’t participate in global aid reporting systems. It released some figures in 2011 and 2014 but gave few details and none about individual countries.  AidData released its first report in 2013 focusing on Chinese financing to Africa. Parks said its data have been used by other scholars to launch more than 100 research projects.  “AidData is the most comprehensive source of information on China’s lending for development projects,” said David Dollar, an economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington and former World Bank country director in Beijing, in an email.  “The data show that China’s lending is indiscriminate with respect to governance. Some big borrowers have poor rule of law, such as Venezuela, Angola and Pakistan,” Dollar wrote. “The overall pattern of lending indicates that it is demand-driven by which countries want to borrow rather than by a Chinese master plan.”  Parks said the data show more Chinese finance goes to countries that vote with Beijing at the United Nations. He said that “might not look good,” but a similar analysis of U.S. and other Western donors shows they act the same way.  “In a sense, Beijing has taken a page out of the playbook of traditional Western donors,” said Parks. “That doesn’t comport with the ‘rogue donor’ narrative that China is somehow inferior or different.”  Parks said the project didn’t try to measure whether Chinese aid undercuts environmental or other standards by giving an alternative to more stringent conditions on Western aid.  But a separate study published this year by researcher Diego Hernandez of Heidelberg found the World Bank attached “significantly fewer conditions” to loans if recipients also had aid available from China.  “New donors might be perceived as an attractive financial option to which the World Bank reacts by offering credits less restrictively in order to remain competitive,” wrote Hernandez.  ___  AidData: http://aiddata.org/",3.0,20,"[4.5, 1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.5, 1.0, 4.0, 0.5, 2.5, 1.5, 5.0, 2.5, 3.0, 5.0, 2.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 4.0]"
478,1853,10,10,2017,2017-10-10,Associated Press News,"AP FACT CHECK: Trump’s empty boasts on legislation, economy","President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in the Oval Office of the White House, Tuesday, Oct. 10, 2017, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)  WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s latest recitation of his accomplishments is marked by empty boasts.  He’s not hitting new heights on economic growth compared with his predecessor. His legislative achievements are notably thin, even as he speaks of historic achievements with Congress. His contention that he’s trying to keep “Obamacare” afloat until it can be replaced stretches credulity.  And, no, Obamacare is not making life difficult for Henry Kissinger, as Trump implied.  Here’s a look at some of Trump’s statements in an interview with Forbes magazine and after sitting down Tuesday with Kissinger, the foreign policy maven:  TRUMP: “So GDP last quarter was 3.1 percent. Most of the folks that are in your business, and elsewhere, were saying that would not be hit for a long time. You know, Obama never hit the number.” — Forbes interview.  THE FACTS: Yes, Barack Obama did, repeatedly. Growth topped 3 percent in eight quarters during Obama’s presidency.  When Forbes pointed out that Obama had reached that benchmark, Trump amended his claim: “He never hit it on a yearly basis.”  That’s true. The economy never grew by more than 3 percent for a full calendar year under Obama. That hasn’t happened since 2005. It is unlikely to happen this year, either.  ___  TRUMP: “Now, we’re going to have to do something with Obamacare because it’s failing. Henry Kissinger does not want to pay 116 percent increase in his premiums, but that’s what’s happening.” — after meeting Kissinger.  THE FACTS: It is super safe to assume that Kissinger, 94, the former secretary of state and national security adviser, chairman of his own international consulting firm and prolific author, is not bothered by rising Obamacare premiums. It’s also against the law for an insurer to sell an Obamacare plan to someone who’s covered by Medicare.  It’s also unclear what Trump is referring to when he cites a 116 percent premium increase.  In Arizona this year, unsubsidized premiums for a hypothetical 27-year-old buying a benchmark Obamacare plan increased 116 percent, according to an earlier government estimate. That sticker price, however, could be reduced significantly with subsidies available to low- and moderate-income people.  ___  TRUMP: “I’ve had just about the most legislation passed of any president, in a nine-month period, that’s ever served. We had over 50 bills passed. I’m not talking about executive orders only, which are very important. I’m talking about bills.” — Forbes interview.  THE FACTS: He’s signed little of consequence into law, a thin record all the more striking because of the Republican majority in the House and Senate. His record pales not just next to Franklin Roosevelt’s but with Obama’s and others.  All presidents sign routine legislation. Trump is no exception. Among the more than 50 bills he’s enacted with his signature: legislation naming a Veterans Affairs health clinic in Butler County, Pennsylvania, after Bataan Death March survivor Abie Abraham, appointing a regent at the Smithsonian Institution, and naming a federal building and courthouse in Nashville, Tennessee, after late Sen. Fred Thompson.  He’s also signed emergency aid for hurricane victims.  The only far-reaching bill he’s signed is one he didn’t like but went along with, tightening sanctions on Russia and Iran. Meantime, his promised repeal and replacement of Obama’s health care law has yet to materialize after twice failing in Congress.  His proposed tax overhaul is in play, not in place, and the big-ticket infrastructure initiative he promised hasn’t come to Congress.  FDR, in contrast, pushed through more than a dozen historic laws in his first 100 days, never mind nine months, setting in place the pillars of his New Deal to combat the Depression. Obama signed an enormous stimulus package into law in his first month, while also succeeding in getting a law expanding health care for children and the Lilly Ledbetter bill on equal pay for women, also in 100 days.  ___  TRUMP on Obama’s health law: “What we’re doing is trying to keep it afloat, because it’s failing.” — Forbes interview.  THE FACTS: He’d like to sink Obamacare. Short of that, it’s true he has thrown at least a temporary lifeline to the health insurance markets set up under the law. Despite his threats to cut off payments to insurers that help reduce consumers’ copays and deductibles, his administration has continued making the payments month to month.  Yet his administration has announced sharp cuts in programs promoting health care enrollment under the law for next year.  Advertising will be cut from $100 million spent on 2017 sign-ups to $10 million, according to health officials. As well, money for consumer helpers called “navigators” will be cut about 40 percent. And the enrollment season for the subsidized individual-insurance market will be considerably shorter for 2018, running from Nov. 1-Dec. 15 this year.  ___  Associated Press writers Donna Cassata, Christopher S.

(AP) — Spacewalking astronauts hustled through a lube job and camera swaps outside the International Space Station on Tuesday, their second trip outside in less than a week.  Astronaut Mark Vande Hei made fast work of greasing the big robot arm’s new hand.  Vande Hei and station commander Randy Bresnik replaced the latching mechanism on one end of the 58-foot robot arm last Thursday. The mechanism malfunctioned in August.  Tuesday’s work involved using a grease gun, which resembles a caulking gun, to keep the latching mechanism working smoothly. Vande Hei got a jump ahead in some greasing chores, but the two-part job still will spill into next week, in a third and final spacewalk.  “Why don’t we wash, rinse, repeat. Do it again in a week,” Bresnik said as the 6 ½-hour spacewalk came to a close.  These latches, or hands, are located on each end of the Canadian-built robot arm. They’re used to grab arriving U.S. cargo ships and also allow the robot arm to move around the orbiting lab.  Launched in 2001 with the rest of the robot arm, the original latches were showing their age. NASA plans to replace the latching mechanism on the opposite end of the arm early next year.  Vande Hei and Bresnik also replaced several camera assemblies at the 250-mile-high outpost.  “What do you do for an encore?” Bresnik asked Vande Hei, after two successful spacewalks.  “I finish six months on the space station,” Vande Hei replied. He arrived a month ago.  Vande Hei will sit out the next spacewalk on Oct. 18. Instead, Bresnik will be accompanied by Joe Acaba, a teacher-turned-astronaut.  Six men live at the orbiting lab: three Americans, two Russians and one Italian. As the space station approached Italy early in the spacewalk, Mission Control urged Bresnik and Vande Hei to take some photos for their crewmate, Paolo Nespoli.",5.0,1,[5.0]

(John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation via AP)  CHICAGO (AP) — A director who has taken opera from the concert hall to the streets of Los Angeles and an organizer who helped put a human face on the plight of young undocumented immigrants are among this year’s MacArthur fellows and recipients of the so-called genius grants.  The Chicago-based John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation on Wednesday announced the 24 fellows, who each receive $625,000 over five years to spend any way they choose. The recipients work in a variety of fields, from computer science to theater, immunology and photography.  The foundation has awarded the fellowships annually since 1981 to people who show “exceptional creativity in their work and the prospect for still more in the future.” Previous winners include “Hamilton” playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda and author-journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates.  There is no application process. Instead, an anonymous pool of nominators brings potential fellows to the foundation’s attention. Those selected learn they’ve been chosen shortly before the awards are announced.  For opera director and producer Yuval Sharon, the news that he had been selected was “an enormous shock and honor.” When the foundation called, he assumed they were seeking a referral for someone else who’d been nominated.  “I’m totally amazed,” said Sharon, 37, the founder and artistic director of The Industry, a Los Angeles-based production company that produces operas in nontraditional spaces and formats.  A 2015 production transported audience members and performers to various locations in Los Angeles via limousines, with singers and musicians performing along the way and at each stop.  His next work, an adaptation of the radio program “War of the Worlds” will utilize decommissioned World War II sirens to broadcast the performance occurring inside the theater onto the streets. The sounds of performers stationed outdoors — and likely the traffic and other street noise — will then be transmitted back into the concert hall.  Sharon said he comes across many people who don’t think opera is for them, but he hopes hearing about these kinds of “audacious experiments” will peak their interest.  Another fellow, Cristina Jiménez Moreta, is co-founder and executive director of United We Dream, a national network of groups led by immigrant youth.  Moreta, 33, and her parents came to the U.S. illegally from Ecuador when she was a child. At 19, she revealed her undocumented status publicly. It was a move that put her and her family at risk of deportation, but also placed her at the forefront of a movement to change the way immigrants are perceived.  She was instrumental in pressing for the 2012 adoption of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the now-endangered executive order that allowed thousands of undocumented young people to live without fear of deportation.  Moreta said the fellowship is recognition of the resilience shown by her parents and other immigrants who “had the courage to stand up and say ‘we are here, this is our home and we are fighting.’”  The first people she told were her parents, who were fearful when she started organizing but now join her in marches and to pass petitions.  “They’re very proud,” she said.  Also selected was Dawoud Bey, a photographer and educator from Chicago whose portraits often feature people from marginalized communities. For “The Birmingham Project,” he commemorated the 1963 bombing at a church in Birmingham, Alabama, that killed six children, with a series of portraits of Birmingham residents who were the age of each of the children killed and the age they would be if they had lived.  Others announced Wednesday were writer and cultural critic Viet Thanh Nguyen — whose novel, “The Sympathizer,” about a communist double agent, won the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for fiction — and Derek Peterson, a historian of East Africa and professor at the University of Michigan.  ___  Online: www.macfound.org  ___  This story has been updated to correct the spelling of the Chicago photographer’s name to Dawoud Bey, not Deyoud Bey.",5.0,1,[5.0]

NASA is using the asteroid’s close flyby to test Earth’s warning network for incoming space rocks. The asteroid will pass within about 27,000 miles (43,000 kilometers) of Antarctica early Thursday, Oct. 11, 2017. (Olivier Hainaut (ESO), Marco Micheli (ESA), Detlef Koschny (ESA)/ESO/ESA NEOCC via AP)  CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — NASA is using an asteroid’s close flyby to test Earth’s warning network for incoming space rocks.  The small asteroid was on track to pass within 27,200 miles (43,800 kilometers) of Antarctica early Thursday.  Program scientist Michael Kelley said that’s “pretty close” as these things go. But he stressed there’s no chance it will hit us. Future space rocks might, though — thus this first-of-its-kind cosmic fire drill.  “You never expect your office building to catch fire and to be trapped in there, but you have fire drills anyway,” he said Wednesday. “That’s what I’ve been using as kind of an analogy to what we’re doing here.”  Observatories worldwide — part of the International Asteroid Warning Network — have been zooming in on the asteroid called 2012 TC4 for weeks to test communication and coordination. Kelley said it’s gone well.  Until now, researchers relied on “tabletop” tests, simulations with no actual asteroids involved. The exercise will continue for another week, as observatories keep tracking the asteroid as it departs Earth’s neighborhood.  First spotted in 2012 and then disappearing from view until this past July, the asteroid is estimated to measure 45 feet to 100 feet (14 to 30 meters.). Kelley said astronomers should have a better handle on the shape and size of the rock — which they believe is oblong, like a potato — in coming days and weeks, as more observations pour in.  Scientists picked this particular asteroid because they knew it did not threaten Earth, yet had some uncertainty in its path. That uncertainty is what provided the challenge for observers, all volunteers in this project. They are using major telescopes in Hawaii and Arizona, among other places. Puerto Rico’s Arecibo Observatory got knocked out by last month’s Hurricane Maria and could not take part.  Backyard astronomers have little chance of seeing the asteroid, according to Kelley, given its speed and faintness. It won’t be visible with the naked eye. The closest approach: 1:40 a.m. EDT Thursday.  The communication lines for the test have extended all the way to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and even the White House, according to Kelley, who’s leading the effort for NASA’s Planetary Defense Coordination Office.  Another test — using another actual asteroid headed harmlessly our way — is planned in the next few years.  ___  Online:  NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/planetarydefense",4.625,4,"[4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.0]"

In his new autobiography, the retired astronaut writes about his U.S. record-breaking year in space and the challenging life events that got him there. (Bill Ingalls/NASA via AP)  CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — In his new autobiography, retired astronaut Scott Kelly gives an unflinchingly blunt take on his U.S. record-breaking year in space and the challenging life events that got him there.  This isn’t your usual astronaut’s memoir.  Kelly recounts dumpster diving on the International Space Station for discarded meals after a supply capsule was destroyed and ending up with “some dude’s used underwear” in his hands. He writes about the congestion, headaches and burning eyes he endured from high carbon dioxide levels and the feeling no one cared at Mission Control in Houston.  In his book, Kelly tells how prostate cancer surgery almost got him banned from space station duty, and how his vision problem during an earlier spaceflight almost cost him the one-year mission, which spanned from March 2015 to March 2016.  He tells how he visited a tattoo parlor before launch and got black dots all over his body to make it easier to take ultrasound tests in orbit, and how he fashioned extra puke bags for a nauseous crewmate.  Kelly said his goal in writing ”″Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery,′ was to tell the whole story.  So many other NASA astronauts’ memoirs “focus on the good stuff and not necessarily the personal things that happened in their lives, things they might not be proud of, things that we all have that makes us normal, relatable people,” he told The Associated Press. “So I felt like sharing is good, but ... the bad stuff, too, makes the story more believable.”  In the book, he writes about a little-known incident that he says occurred during his first space station stint in 2010, when a Russian cosmonaut came untethered during a spacewalk and began floating away. Luckily, Oleg Skripochka happened to hit an antenna that bounced him back toward the space station, enabling him to grab on and save his life, according to Kelly.  Even though he was aboard the space station at the time, Kelly said he didn’t learn about it until his yearlong mission five years later, when it casually came up in conversation with other cosmonauts. “I was like really? Holy crap. Crazy,” Kelly recalled in an AP interview.  He remembered Skripochka had looked shaken, but thought it was because he had been out on his first spacewalk.  On Wednesday, the Russian Space Agency’s press department said it contacted Skripochka, who did not confirm Kelly’s account. No other comment was provided.  “I’ve often pondered what we would have done if we’d known he was drifting irretrievably away from the station,” Kelly writes. “It probably would have been possible to tie his family into the comm system in his spacesuit so they could say good-bye before the rising CO2 or oxygen deprivation caused him to lose consciousness — not something I wanted to spend a lot of time thinking about as my own spacewalk was approaching.”  Published by Knopf , “Endurance” comes out Tuesday. So does a version for children, “My Journey to the Stars,” put out by Penguin Random House.  The 53-year-old Kelly said he didn’t discover his passion for aviation and space until reading Tom Wolfe’s 1979 book “The Right Stuff” in college. Kelly writes that he was a terrible student and likely suffered from attention deficit disorder.  The former spaceman also tells how he realized right before his wedding that he didn’t want to go through with it, but did anyway, leading to a troubled marriage and eventually divorce, and how he initially didn’t want “that space station stink” on him — getting space station assignments — for fear it would limit his shuttle-flying opportunities. He flew twice on space shuttles and had two extended stays at the space station, sharing the entire 340-day mission, his last, with Russian Mikhail Kornienko.  When asked if it was difficult exposing his weaknesses when astronauts are supposed to be perfect or close to it, Kelly replied, “Naw, I feel like I’m like a below-average guy doing slightly above-average stuff.”  Kelly figured he might write a book, given it was NASA’s longest single spaceflight ever. So he kept a journal in orbit and took notes about how the place looked, smelled and felt “to make someone feel like they were on the space station.”  “The book hasn’t come out yet,” Kelly said, “and as I get closer to it coming out, I’m thinking, ‘Man, I’ve got to live with this for the rest of my life.’ ”  Kelly’s identical twin brother, Mark, also a former Navy pilot and NASA astronaut as well as author, was among the several people who read early drafts. Scott Kelly devotes several pages to the 2011 shooting of his sister-in-law, former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Aboard the space station at the time, Kelly wondered whether he was calling his family too much — “whether in my effort to be there for them I was becoming intrusive.”  Back on Earth and now retired for 1 ½ years, Kelly said he misses being in space. Of course, when he was in space, he missed Earth. He credits that saying to a Russian crewmate, Gennady Padalka, the world’s most experienced spaceman, and isn’t sure the saying made it into the book.  “I need to write a sequel of all the stuff I left out.”  ___  AP reporter Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow contributed to this report.  ___  Online:  Kelly: http://www.scottkelly.com/",3.0,6,"[3.5, 2.5, 5.0, 4.0, 2.5, 0.5]"

From Thursday, Oct. 12, 2017 through Nov. 2., Skinner Auctioneers and Appraisers is selling more than 400 vintage prints of photos, including the photo of Aldrin, made by American astronauts from 1961 to 1972. (Neil Armstrong/NASA via AP)  BOSTON (AP) — John Glenn was the first person to snap a photograph of Earth from outer space. Neil Armstrong took the first picture from the moon’s surface.  The original prints of those are among 445 rare photos taken by American astronauts that are being sold by Skinner Auctioneers and Appraisers starting this week.  The Massachusetts auction house says “The Beauty of Space” is the first-ever U.S. auction to focus solely on vintage photographs produced by NASA astronauts during the heyday of lunar exploration, from 1961 to 1972. The auction goes live on Thursday and runs through Nov. 2.  The photographs are valuable not only for their scientific and historical significance, but also for their artistry, says Michelle Lamunière, a specialist in fine photography at Skinner.  “While the astronauts’ primary goal was to record their activities, they were inspired by what they witnessed, creating images that transcend documentation,” she said.  The images up for auction are not reprints but original, gelatin silver or chromogenic prints produced by NASA following the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo missions.  Many bear original NASA marks, captions and identifying numbers. Individually, the images are worth anywhere from $300 to $9,000, according to the auction house.  The photos were acquired by an unnamed private collector from former NASA scientists and employees.  They include astronaut portraits, candid shots during training exercises and dramatic images of spacewalks and views of the Earth and moon from space.  Among the standout photos is a 1962 image by John Glenn of the sun illuminating the Earth. It’s the first photo of the planet taken by a human from space.  There’s also Buzz Aldrin’s 1969 picture of the first footprint on lunar soil (his own) as well as his colleague Neil Armstrong’s famous “visor” photo from that same Apollo 11 mission. Armstrong’s photo captures Aldrin on the moon’s surface, his gold-plated sun visor reflecting Armstrong and their lunar module.

Former Obama administration officials who played central roles in brokering the Iran nuclear agreement are scheduled to brief congressional Democrats on the merits of the international accord as President Donald Trump prepares to announce a decision that could lead to an unraveling of the pact. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Several congressional Democrats who split with President Barack Obama to oppose the nuclear agreement with Iran are now urging President Donald Trump to uphold the international accord, arguing that robust enforcement is the best way to counter Tehran’s malign behavior in the Middle East.  The reversal underscores deep concerns among lawmakers that Trump will inform Congress in the coming days that the landmark 2015 agreement with Iran is contrary to America’s national security interests. That declaration could lead to an unraveling of the seven-nation pact and leave the United States, not Iran, as the country that balked at honoring its commitments.  Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., who voted against the agreement two years ago, said at a hearing Wednesday U.S. interests are best served by keeping the deal and aggressively policing the agreement to ensure Iran doesn’t violate the terms. Engel, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, said unwinding the agreement would send a dangerous signal to allies and adversaries alike.  The U.S. will need to work with Britain, France and Germany — all parties to the Iran nuclear pact — to fix its flaws and those countries need to know that the U.S. is a reliable partner, according to Engel. North Korea’s leaders, meanwhile, would have little incentive to negotiate a nuclear disarmament if they see the Iran deal collapse, he said.  “We need to work with allies and partners on a shared agenda that holds the regime in Iran accountable, not dividing America from our closest friends across the globe,” Engel said.  Notably, the committee’s top Republican, Rep. Ed Royce, said the U.S. should adhere to the deal.  “As flawed as the deal is, I believe we must now enforce the hell out of it,” said the California lawmaker.  Former Obama administration officials who played central roles in brokering the Iran nuclear agreement briefed congressional Democrats later Wednesday on the merits of the international accord. Former Secretary of State John Kerry, former Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz and Wendy Sherman, the former undersecretary of state for political affairs, along with European ambassadors met behind closed doors with lawmakers.  Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., opposed the Iran nuclear agreement in part because the deal gave Tehran access to tens of billions of dollars in previously frozen assets. But he’s changed his thinking. Sherman said if the deal is renounced, Iran gets to keep all the money and also is freed from the restraints imposed by the agreement.  Under the 2015 deal, Tehran agreed to roll back its nuclear program in exchange for relief from wide-ranging oil, trade and financial sanctions that had choked the Iranian economy.  Trump faces an Oct. 15 deadline mandated by law to tell Congress if he believes Iran is complying with the nuclear accord and if it advances U.S. interests. If the president doesn’t certify compliance with the requirements, Congress has 60 days to decide whether to re-impose or “snap back” sanctions lifted under the agreement.  The White House was looking at a Friday announcement after scrapping a tentative plan for Thursday, according to a congressional source and a non-governmental source familiar with the matter.  Officials familiar with the internal deliberations as well as informed sources outside the administration say they do not believe Trump will call for Congress to reinstate the sanctions. Instead, these officials said Trump is more inclined to push legislators to amend the law that requires the president to certify Iran’s compliance every 90 days.  Trump detests the certification requirement, which forces him to sign off every three months on an accord he has called the worst deal ever negotiated by America, according to the officials.  The officials discussing the details and timing of the announcement spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss internal deliberations.  Republican legislators recently began drawing up new versions of the law that remove the 90-day timetable and replace it with “semi-annual” certifications, according to the officials.  Drafts of two proposals seen by The Associated Press, one from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, Bob Corker, R-Tenn., and one from committee member and harsh deal critic Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., would demand that the intelligence community produce judgments on a wide range of Iranian behavior that is not covered by the nuclear deal, including ballistic missile testing and development and threats to Israel and the Mideast more broadly.  Trump threatened during the presidential campaign to tear the pact up if he was elected. But many of his top national security aides don’t want to dismantle the agreement, and America’s European allies have lobbied the Trump administration and Congress to preserve the accord.  Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee last week that Iran “is not in material breach of the agreement.” Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said at the same hearing that the deal is still in the U.S. national security interest.  More than 180 House Democrats sent a letter to Trump last week calling on him to certify compliance unless he could produce “credible evidence of a material breach by Iran.” Among the lawmakers who signed the letter were Engel and 12 other House Democrats who had criticized the deal when it was reached two years ago. Among them were Reps. Ted Deutch, D-Fla., and Nita Lowey, D-N.Y.  The agreement contains specific restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program that will expire after predetermined periods of time. Those provisions relate to enriching uranium to levels near those needed to produce the fuel for a nuclear weapon, as well as other activities that limit Iran’s atomic capabilities at various sites.  Deutch said the danger of walking away from the agreement is that those expiration dates “would have effectively dropped from a decade to a day” because Iran would be freed of its obligations under the deal.  Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, was one of four Senate Democrats who opposed the Iran nuclear agreement in 2015. He still has concerns with how the accord will contain Iran in the future, but he doesn’t want the pact ditched.  “I think I speak for a lot of us who opposed the agreement. We thought it was the wrong decision,” Cardin told reporters recently. “Once it was entered into, once it was implemented, we want to see it enforced. We don’t want to see the United States violate it.”  ___  Follow Richard Lardner on Twitter at http://twitter.com/rplardner  ___  AP Diplomatic Writer Matthew Lee and AP writer Kevin Freking contributed to this report.",2.9285714285714284,7,"[4.5, 0.5, 3.0, 3.5, 3.5, 0.5, 5.0]"

Mike Conaway, R-Texas, center, and Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., right, speak with reporters as they emerge from a closed-door meeting at the Capitol with Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of social media giant Facebook, amid the company's discovery of Russia-linked ads that ran before and after the 2016 election, in Washington, Wednesday, Oct. 11, 2017. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)  WASHINGTON (AP) — One of Facebook’s top executives met Wednesday with House members investigating the company’s Russia-linked ads and told them the social media giant is serious about dealing with the issue.  Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, told lawmakers behind closed doors that the company is working hard to ensure Americans “understand what the propaganda is that they may or may not be reading,” said House Republican Rep. Mike Conaway, who is leading the House intelligence committee probe.  Wednesday’s meetings are ahead of a Nov. 1 House Intelligence Committee hearing at which Facebook, Twitter and Google are expected to testify. The Senate Intelligence Committee is also holding an open hearing with the three companies that day.  Investigators have recently focused on the spread of false news stories and propaganda on social media and have pressured Facebook, along with Twitter and Google, to release any Russia-linked ads. Facebook recently provided three congressional committees with more than 3,000 ads they had traced to a Russian internet agency.  Facebook has said those ads focused on divisive political messages, including LGBT issues, immigration and gun rights, and were seen by an estimated 10 million people.  Conaway, R-Texas, and the top Democrat on the panel, California Rep. Adam Schiff, met with Sandberg in the office of House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. Sandberg also held a separate meeting with Schiff, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California and No. 2 House Democrat Steny Hoyer of Maryland.  Schiff said Sandberg wanted to convey that the company is serious about the issue to members of Congress, some of whom have expressed concerns that the company was reluctant to share information and ensure that foreign governments don’t wage information campaigns in U.S. elections.  Sandberg said, according to Schiff, that Facebook is “determined to take whatever steps are necessary to ferret out foreign actors creating fake identities and using their platform.”  He said Sandberg also indicated the company wants the help of the intelligence community to identify who may be using Facebook for those reasons.  Conaway and Schiff said after the meeting that they expect to eventually release the Facebook ads. That’s a break from the Senate intelligence committee, which had said it won’t release them. Facebook has also declined to make the ads public.  “My personal bias is that we’ll do that as quickly as we can,” Conaway said, adding that they probably wouldn’t release the ads before the Nov. 1 hearings.  Both men said that in the end, voters need to be more aware of the type of information they are seeking out.  “You and I as voters are responsible for where we get information and how we trust it, and whether we trust it,” Conaway said.  Sandberg also was expected to meet Thursday with the Congressional Black Caucus. Some members of the caucus have been critical of Facebook over the ads, many of which had racial themes.  One member of Congress who viewed the ads said that of about 70 that person had viewed, all of them had racial themes. The person said the ads were meant to inflame all sides, with some showing white police officers beating black people. The member declined to be named because the ads aren’t yet public.  In a letter to Facebook last month, Democratic Rep. Robin Kelly of Illinois, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, wrote Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and asked him to do more to strengthen controls against discriminatory ads.  “It is my belief that Facebook cannot be the Trojan Horse through which America’s vulnerabilities are exploited,” Kelly wrote.  Also Thursday, a data mining and analysis company that worked on President Donald Trump’s campaign confirmed it is turning over information to the House intelligence committee, to “provide it with information that might help its investigation.”  “We believe that other organizations that worked on the campaign have been asked to do the same,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement, adding that there was no “suggestion of wrongdoing.”  ___  Associated Press writer Chad Day contributed to this report.",3.5,1,[3.5]
514,1904,10,12,2017,2017-10-12,Associated Press News,Tricked out: Pickup trucks get more luxurious,"In this Monday, Oct. 9, 2017, photo, fairgoers look at pickup trucks on display at the State Fair of Texas in Dallas. America's favorite luxury vehicle is a pickup truck. Buyers are increasingly outfitting their pickups with all the comforts of luxury cars, from heated and cooled seats to backup cameras to panoramic glass roofs. (AP Photo/LM Otero)  DETROIT (AP) — Heated and cooled seats. Backup cameras. Panoramic glass roofs.  Not exactly what springs to mind when you think of a pickup. But that’s what American truck buyers increasingly want, spending an average of $46,844 on a pickup, according to Kelley Blue Book. That’s more than the starting price of luxury SUVs like the Mercedes GLC or the Lexus RX. In 2016, pickup trucks made up a little more than a third of all vehicles that sold for over $50,000.  At the State Fair of Texas this month, Ford Motor Co. is displaying its most expensive pickup yet: The F-Series Super Duty Limited, a luxury heavy-duty truck with a starting price of $80,835. It has custom two-tone leather seats, a heated steering wheel wrapped in hand-stitched leather and high-tech features like a 360-degree camera system that guides drivers when they’re hitching up a trailer.  A fully-loaded F-450 — the biggest version of the Super Duty — will top out at $94,455. It’s capable of towing an Air Force F-35 fighter plane, but it also has massaging seats.  Fiat Chrysler’s Ram brand is also showing luxury pickups at the fair. The 2018 Laramie Longhorn Southfork edition has a walnut-trimmed steering wheel and 4G Wi-Fi capability. The Heavy Duty Lone Star Silver — sold only in Texas — has a luxurious bright chrome grille. Both start around $50,000 and will be available later this fall.  On a recent visit to the fair, some visitors balked at the prices. One said he’s rather buy a Mercedes S-Class if he had $80,000 to spare. But others took the high prices in stride.  “It’s awesome. I’d love to be going down the road in it right now,” said Paul Churchill as he sat in the cab of the Super Duty Limited. “If you’re looking for all the technology they have in these trucks now, it’s probably worth it.”  Demand for luxury trucks is strong. Ford says around half of the individual buyers who purchase Super Duty trucks opt for one of its three luxury versions — King Ranch, Lariat or Platinum. The Limited version will sit at the top of that heap.  Kendall Bachman, who works for an executive search firm in the renewable energy industry, paid $40,000 in 2013 for a limited edition 2011 Toyota Tundra CrewMax that’s upholstered in leather from San Antonio-based Lucchese Boot Co.  Bachman, of Redding, California, needed a truck to tow his fishing boat and camping trailer and haul lumber and landscaping materials for his 3-acre property. He also wanted something big to protect his four kids and leather that could withstand stains.  At the same time, Bachman wanted his truck to convey status.  “I wanted something that embodied who I am more than a luxury sedan, but that would still allow me to feel comfortable attending meetings for business people in town who drive luxury cars,” Bachman said.  The luxury trend has helped pickups outpace the industry in terms of the prices they command. So far this year, the average vehicle is selling for $34,671, up 38 percent from 2005. The average price of a full-size truck has jumped 54 percent in that same period, to $46,844.  Ford kicked off the luxury truck trend in 1999 when it introduced the Harley-Davidson F-Series. The King Ranch edition followed in 2001. General Motors Co. brought out its high-end GMC Sierra Denali pickup in 2002; the Chevrolet Silverado High Country followed in 2014. The Ram Laramie Longhorn arrived in 2010.  Todd Eckert, Ford’s truck group marketing manager, stressed that Ford is still meeting the needs of buyers who want an everyday work truck. The base model of the 2018 Super Duty starts at $32,890. But he said some customers are also demanding more comfort and safety technology, like forward collision warning systems and adaptive cruise control.  “They have come to a point where they want to reward themselves,” Eckert said. The Super Duty Limited goes on sale this winter.  Rebecca Lindland, an executive analyst with Kelley Blue Book, says luxury truck buyers cut across age spans but share a mindset. They could buy a German luxury car, she says, but they want the blue-collar brawn of an American truck — or, in Toyota’s case, a full-size truck built in Texas.  “These are people with money. These are people who have been very successful,” she said. “All they want is the most tarted-up pickup they can buy.”  ___  Associated Press photographer Matthew Otero contributed from Dallas.  .",3.8536585365853657,41,"[2.5, 3.5, 0.5, 4.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 2.0, 5.0, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 2.0, 4.5, 3.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.0, 2.0, 4.5, 5.0, 4.5, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 1.5, 4.0, 2.5, 4.0, 5.0, 1.5, 4.5, 3.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.0]"

The prosecutors and Samsung lawyers sparred Thursday during a first hearing by the appeals court on the effort by Lee to have his five-year prison sentence overturned. (AP Photo/Lee Jin-man)  SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Prosecutors cited a past ruling on a North Korean spy case as one reason why Samsung’s billionaire heir deserved a lengthy prison term after being convicted of offering bribes to the country’s then-president and one of her associates.  The prosecutors and Lee Jae-yong’s lawyers sparred Thursday during a first hearing by the appeals court on the effort by Lee, Samsung’s vice chairman and de facto leader, to have his five-year prison sentence overturned.  Lee was convicted in August of offering $7.9 million in bribes to Park Geun-hye and one of her associates when Park was South Korea’s president in order to get state support as he strengthened his control over Samsung empire after his father fell ill. Prosecutors had asked judges to sentence him to 12 years in prison accusing him of offering $38 million in bribes but judges at the lower court said Samsung’s donations to two foundations controlled by Park’s friend did not constitute bribery. Both sides have appealed.  Lee, 49, the only son of South Korea’s richest individual, sat silently in the courtroom except when he told judges his birthdate and home address. Lee appeared relaxed, yawning during the morning hearing as the two sides argued over whether or not notebooks written by a former aide to the ousted president should have been admitted as evidence.  Prosecutors cited the spy case in arguing that the notebooks, which contained memos of Park’s comments after meeting with Lee, showed the Samsung heir was guilty. In that case, the Supreme Court ruled that a memo saved in a personal computer was enough to prove there had been contact between South Koreans and a pro-North Korean group, the prosecutors said.  Lee’s lawyers said the notebooks were not admissible because the memos were taken by a third person who was not present at the meeting between the former president and Lee.  “There is no subject, no verb, just a list of words,” said one of Lee’s lawyers on the notebooks. “It does not meet the standards to be evidence.”  Whether the appeals court accepts the notebooks as evidence will likely determine the fate of Lee. If Lee’s lawyers succeed in lowering sentencing to three years or less, judges can suspend sentencing and he could be released from jail.  The prosecutors also argued that Lee and four other Samsung executives who were convicted along with him should receive a harsher punishment at the appeals court because they lied during lower court hearings in order to protect Lee.  “Their disrespectful attitude toward legal orders should be reflected in the sentencing,” one of the prosecutors said.  The Samsung heir’s star-studded defense team is led by Lee In-jae, a partner at Bae, Kim & Lee LLC. He is a former judge whose previous positions include a senior judge at Seoul High Court and head of Seoul Central District Court.  Despite Lee’s absence, Samsung Electronics is enjoying one of the best time for its business.

U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed to redo the North American Free Trade Agreement, but NAFTA has widened access to Mexican and Canadian markets, boosting U.S. farm exports and benefiting many farmers. Hurst says NAFTA has been good for his business and worries that he'll lose out in a renegotiation. (AP Photo/Nati Harnik, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — The North American Free Trade Agreement is in its 23rd year. But there are growing doubts that it will survive through its 24th.  President Donald Trump has threatened to withdraw from the agreement if he can’t get what he wants in a renegotiation. But what he wants — from requiring that more auto production be made-in-America to shifting more government contracts to U.S. companies — will likely be unacceptable to America’s two NAFTA partners, Mexico and Canada.  Round 4 of NAFTA talks began Wednesday in Arlington, Virginia. In a sign of how contentious things could get, the countries extended the negotiations for two extra days, through Tuesday.  “What is the administration going to do? Are they going to be patient and work through these things?” asks Phil Levy, senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. “Or are they going to take this as a pretext and say, ‘We tried negotiations; they failed. Now we need to blow this up?’ ”  Blowing up the deal appears to be Trump’s favored choice. On the campaign trail, he called NAFTA a job-killing disaster. And in an interview with Forbes magazine published Tuesday, Trump said: “I happen to think that NAFTA will have to be terminated if we’re going to make it good. Otherwise, I believe you can’t negotiate a good deal.”  Levy pegs the chance of NAFTA’s survival at less than 50 percent.  The end of NAFTA would send economic tremors across the continent. American farmers depend on Mexico’s market. Manufacturers have built complicated supply chains that cross NAFTA borders. Consumers have benefited from lower costs.  NAFTA erased most trade barriers along the United States, Canada and Mexico and led to an explosion in trade between the three countries. But critics say the pact sent hundreds of thousands of U.S. manufacturing jobs to Mexico, where corporations took advantage of low-wage labor.  Before the renegotiation began in August, many business and farm groups hoped the Trump administration would settle for tweaking rather than abandoning the trade deal — updating it, for example, to reflect the rise of e-commerce. But U.S. Trade Rep. Robert Lighthizer declared at the outset that the U.S. wouldn’t be satisfied with anything but a major overhaul.  So the administration has been seeking to ensure that more auto production be made in America to receive NAFTA benefits, that more government contracts in the NAFTA bloc go to U.S. companies and that NAFTA expire unless the countries agreed every few years to extend it. It also wants to scrap a dispute-resolution process favored by Canada.  Those proposals are considered poison pills by Canada and Mexico.  Visiting Washington on Wednesday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters that he thinks “it is very important and very possible to get a win-win-win” from the NAFTA talks. But he acknowledged that “we have to be ready for anything — and we are.”  The negotiators are under pressure to reach a deal this year — before presidential elections in Mexico and midterm elections in the United States raise the political temperature in 2018.  “The administration set itself the task of doing a really radical overhaul and having it done by Christmas,” says Levy, a former trade adviser to President George W. Bush. “I’m not surprised that Ambassador Lighthizer hasn’t been able to square that circle.”  Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Trade, says Trump “very likely” has the legal authority to withdraw from NAFTA on his own if talks collapse. But Congress can fight back. Lawmakers could pass a resolution calling on the president to obtain congressional authority before invoking the NAFTA clause that lets countries pull out. They could also threaten to block the president’s agenda unless he secures congressional approval to withdraw.  If the United States left NAFTA, trade barriers to Canada and Mexico would pop back up. Some of the tariffs wouldn’t be especially high. But Mexican tariffs on many American farm products could soar — to as high as 37 percent on corn, for example, notes Caroline Freund, a senior fellow at Peterson.  For that reason, many agricultural lobbies and lawmakers from farm states have urged the administration to “do no harm” in the NAFTA talks.  Daniel Ujczo, a trade lawyer with Dickinson Wright PLLC, predicts that Canada and Mexico would likely call a timeout if the United States insists on pushing contentious proposals.  “The Canadian and Mexican strategy will be to take a pause,” he says, and “allow the U.S. domestic process to play itself out” with business and farm groups and many lawmakers rising to defend NAFTA.  NAFTA supporters are already rallying. In a speech Tuesday in Mexico City, Thomas Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, vowed: “We’re going to fight like hell to protect the agreement.”  ___  AP writer Rob Gillies in Toronto contributed to this report.",3.019230769230769,26,"[4.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 1.0, 0.5, 3.5, 0.5, 5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 0.5, 2.5, 4.5, 4.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.0, 5.0, 1.5, 3.0, 2.5, 4.0, 2.0, 2.0]"

Wild turkeys have bounced back in New England in what's considered a success story for wildlife restoration. But as they spread farther into urban areas, they're increasingly coming into conflict with humans who say they ravage gardens, damage cars and attack people. (AP Photo/Collin Binkley)  BOSTON (AP) — Not everyone is celebrating the return of the wild turkeys.  After being wiped out from New England in the 1800s, the birds have stormed back in what’s considered a major success story for wildlife restoration. But as they spread farther into urban areas, they’re increasingly clashing with residents who say they destroy gardens, damage cars, chase pets and attack people.  Complaints about troublesome turkeys have surged in Boston and its suburbs over the past three years, causing headaches for police and health officials called to handle problems, according to city and town records provided to The Associated Press. It’s a familiar dilemma for some other U.S. towns from coast to coast that have been overrun by turkeys in recent years.  Boston city officials say they received at least 60 complaints last year, a threefold increase over the year before. Nearby Somerville, Belmont and Brookline have seen similar upticks, combining for a total of 137 turkey gripes since the start of last year.  “Several years ago it was more of an isolated situation here and there,” said David Scarpitti, the wild turkey and upland game biologist for the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife. “Now it’s starting to spread into communities all around Boston.”  Wild turkeys are increasingly clashing with their human neighbors as they spread out into urban areas. New England's turkey population has rebounded, but some residents complain that the birds ruin gardens, damage cars and even attack people. (Oct. 13)  Often the grievance is little more than a wayward turkey blocking traffic, but in at least five cases turkeys became so aggressive that police said they had to shoot them as a matter of public safety. Some area residents have suffered minor injuries from the birds, including a 72-year-old woman who told police she was bruised in August after a gang of turkeys scratched and pecked her during a walk.  Turkeys in the wild are far stronger and faster than the ones that land on Thanksgiving tables, experts say. Males in particular are driven to show physical aggression as a way to climb the social pecking order, and they sometimes view humans as potential competitors.  “Turkeys don’t really mean to harm people — it’s just tied to their social dynamics within the flock,” Scarpitti said. “They lose perspective that humans are humans and turkeys are turkeys. They just want to assert dominance over anything.”  Even the earliest Americans picked up on that characteristic, with Ben Franklin famously writing that the turkey is a “Bird of Courage, and would not hesitate to attack a Grenadier of the British Guards who should presume to invade his Farm Yard with a red Coat on.”  In the town of Brookline, Tess Bundy has come to loathe the turkeys that roost behind her home and often come charging when she leaves. She called police in April after a big tom repeatedly launched itself at her and her infant daughter, backing down only after Bundy whacked it several times with a shovel.  “They’re terrible. Every year they’re worse,” said Bundy, a history professor at Merrimack College. “I really do think that they’re a menace to the town.”  The complaints have sent some cities searching for answers, including in Cambridge, where the City Council says it’s working on a plan. Officials in Brookline issued new guidance for fowl encounters in August, telling residents to “step toward the turkey and act confidently.”  Wildlife experts say much of the problem can be blamed on residents who leave out food for turkeys, which entices flocks to settle in and helps them survive winters.  Towns with similar problems in New Jersey, Iowa and Oregon have banned turkey feeding in recent years, and Montana enacted a similar statewide ban in May. But the idea hasn’t spread to the Boston area, where some residents say they enjoy the return of native wildlife.  Not far from two sites where turkeys were shot by police, Brookline resident Suzette Abbott says she’s had no problems with the turkeys that roam her block.  “I don’t think they’re dangerous,” Abbott said. “In the spring they look pretty amazing when the males are displaying their colors. I think they’re quite beautiful if you actually look at their feathers.”  ___  Follow Collin Binkley on Twitter: @cbinkley.",3.4,5,"[4.5, 3.5, 4.0, 2.5, 2.5]"

A new NASA satellite finds another thing to blame on El Nino: A recent record high increase of carbon dioxide in the air.

(AP Photo/Rony Muharrman, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — A new NASA satellite has found another thing to blame on El Nino: A recent record high increase of carbon dioxide in the air.  The super-sized El Nino a couple of years ago led to an increase of 3 billion tons of carbon in the air, most from tropical land areas. The El Nino made it more difficult for plants to suck up man-made carbon emissions and sparked fires that released more carbon into the atmosphere.  The effect was so large that it was the main factor in the biggest one-year jump in heat-trapping gas levels in modern record, NASA scientists said.  Scientists have long known that carbon dioxide levels spike during an El Nino, the natural occasional warming of parts of the central Pacific that causes droughts in some places, floods in others and generally adds to warmer temperatures worldwide.  Data from NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2, which was launched in 2014, provides more specifics on how that happens and by continent.  Researchers found that in drought-struck parts of South America plants grew less, there were more fires in Asia, and there was an increased rate of leaf decay in Africa. The findings were published Thursday in the journal Science.  That 3 billion tons of carbon, while significant, is still dwarfed by the 10 billion tons a year that comes from the burning of coal, oil and gas, said Scott Denning, a Colorado State University atmospheric scientist.  Study co-author Annmarie Eldering, NASA’s deputy project scientist for the satellite, said the new results show how El Nino can counteract efforts to reduce carbon emissions.  Human-caused carbon dioxide emissions were roughly flat in 2014, 2015 and 2016, but National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration figures show that 2015 saw a rise in carbon in the air 3.03 parts per million, the largest since scientists started tracking emissions in Hawaii in 1959.  Normally about 25 percent of the human-caused carbon emissions are sucked up by plants on land, but during this powerful El Nino that was only 5 percent, said Junjie Liu, a NASA scientist and study lead author.  Oceans took out more than normal amount of carbon out of the atmosphere, but it wasn’t enough to compensate for the land deficit, Eldering said.  Jonathan Overpeck, a University of Michigan scientist who was not part of the study, said the research revealed that the regional links between carbon dioxide and El Nino are more complex than previously thought, and raised concern about how the earth will respond to more future warming.  As the world warms, the tropics could add to carbon to the atmosphere in the future instead of taking it out of the air and wildfire emissions are likely to get more severe, Overpeck said.  And some computer simulations say the frequency of El Nino will increase in the future with climate change, Denning said during a NASA press conference.  “In this sense, the 2015-16 El Nino is a glimpse of what is to come,” Overpeck said in an email.",3.1818181818181817,11,"[2.0, 4.5, 5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 2.5, 1.5, 3.0, 3.5, 0.5, 5.0]"

(Kyodo, Vanuatu Meteorological and GeoHazards Department via AP)  The string of active volcanoes around the Pacific Ocean has lived up to its “Ring of Fire” name lately, sparking mass evacuations in Indonesia and Vanuatu and unsettling part of southwestern Japan. The 450 or so volcanoes that make up the ring outline where the massive Pacific Plate grinds against other plates that form the Earth’s crust, creating a 40,000-kilometer (25,000-mile) -long zone prone to earthquakes and other seismic upheaval.  ___  JAPAN  The Shinmoedake volcano in southwestern Japan started erupting Wednesday for the first time in about six years. An ash plume rose 1,700 meters (5,580 feet) from the crater Thursday and ash fell on cities and towns in Miyazaki prefecture. Japanese broadcaster TBS showed students wearing helmets and masks on their way to school at the foot of Shinmoedake. The Japan Meteorological Agency is warning that hot ash and gas clouds known as pyroclastic flows could reach 2 kilometers (1 mile) from the crater, and ash and volcanic rocks are a risk over a wider area depending on wind and elevation. It raised the volcanic alert level from 2 to 3 on a scale of 5.

Hundreds of tremors daily from the mountain indicate magma is rising inside it, prompting authorities to warn a powerful eruption is possible. The volcano spewed lava and deadly fast-moving clouds of boiling hot ash, gas and rocks when it last erupted in 1963, killing more than 1,100 people. A new eruption is likely to kill fewer people because officials have imposed a large no-go zone around the crater but it could paralyze tourism, which many Balinese rely on for their livelihoods. Indonesia has more than one tenth of the world’s active volcanoes and another two are currently erupting. Sinabung in northern Sumatra is shooting plumes of ash high into the atmosphere nearly daily, and Dukono in the Maluku island chain is also periodically erupting.  ___  VANUATU  The entire population of a Pacific island was evacuated in the space of a few days in late September and early October to escape the belching Manaro volcano.

552,1944,10,13,2017,2017-10-13,Associated Press News,Trump to halt subsidies to health insurers,"President Donald Trump waves after signing an executive order on health care in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Thursday, Oct. 12, 2017, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)  WASHINGTON (AP) — In a brash move likely to roil insurance markets, President Donald Trump will “immediately” halt payments to insurers under the Obama-era health care law he has been trying to unravel for months.  The Health and Human Services department made the announcement in a statement late Thursday night. “We will discontinue these payments immediately,” said acting HHS Secretary Eric Hargan and Medicare administrator Seema Verma.  In a separate statement, the White House said the government cannot legally continue to pay the so-called cost-sharing subsidies because they lack a formal authorization by Congress.  However, the administration had been making the payments from month to month, even as Trump threated to cut them off to force Democrats to negotiate over health care. The subsidies help lower copays and deductibles for people with modest incomes.  Halting the payments would trigger a spike in premiums for next year, unless Trump reverses course or Congress authorizes the money. The next payments are due around Oct. 20.  The top two Democrats in Congress sharply denounced the Trump plan in a joint statement.  “It is a spiteful act of vast, pointless sabotage leveled at working families and the middle class in every corner of America,” said House and Senate Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi of California and Chuck Schumer of New York. “Make no mistake about it, Trump will try to blame the Affordable Care Act, but this will fall on his back and he will pay the price for it.”  The president’s action is likely to trigger a lawsuit from state attorneys general, who contend the subsidies to insurers are fully authorized by federal law, and say the president’s position is reckless.  “We are prepared to sue,” said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra. “We’ve taken the Trump Administration to court before and won.”  Word of Trump’s plan came on a day when the president had also signed an executive order directing government agencies to design insurance plans that would offer lower premiums outside the requirements of President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act.  Frustrated over setbacks in Congress, Trump is wielding his executive powers to bring the “repeal and replace” debate to a head. He appears to be following through on his vow to punish Democrats and insurers after the failure of GOP health care legislation.  On Twitter, Trump has termed the payments to insurers a “bailout,” but it’s unclear if the president will get Democrats to negotiate by stopping payment.  Experts have warned that cutting off the money would lead to a double-digit spike in premiums, on top of increases insurers already planned for next year. That would deliver another blow to markets around the country already fragile from insurers exiting and costs rising. Insurers, hospitals, doctors’ groups, state officials and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have urged the administration to keep paying.  Leading GOP lawmakers have also called for continuing the payments to insurers, at least temporarily, so constituents maintain access to health insurance. Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., is working on such legislation with Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington.  The so-called “cost-sharing” subsidies defray copays and deductibles for people with low-to-modest incomes, and can reduce a deductible of $3,500 to a few hundred dollars. Assistance is available to consumers buying individual policies; people with employer coverage are unaffected by the dispute.  Nearly 3 in 5 HealthCare.gov customers qualify for help, an estimated 6 million people or more. The annual cost to the government is currently about $7 billion.  But the subsidies have been under a legal cloud because of a dispute over whether the Obama health care law properly approved them. Adding to the confusion, other parts of the Affordable Care Act clearly direct the government to reimburse the carriers.  For example, the ACA requires insurers to help low-income consumers with their copays and deductibles.  And the law also specifies that the government shall reimburse insurers for the cost-sharing assistance that they provide.  But there’s disagreement over whether the law properly provided a congressional “appropriation,” similar to an instruction to pay. The Constitution says the government shall not spend money unless Congress appropriates it.  House Republicans trying to thwart the ACA sued the Obama administration in federal court in Washington, arguing that the law lacked specific language appropriating the cost-sharing subsidies.  A district court judge agreed with House Republicans, and the case has been on hold before the U.S. appeals court in Washington. Up to this point the Trump administration continued making the monthly payments, as the Obama administration had done.  While the legal issue seems arcane, the impact on consumers would be real.  The Congressional Budget Office estimated that premiums for a standard “silver” plan will increase by about 20 percent without the subsidies. Insurers can recover the cost-sharing money by raising premiums, since those are also subsidized by the ACA, and there’s no legal question about their appropriation.  Consumers who receive tax credits under the ACA to pay their premiums would be shielded from those premium increases.  But millions of others buy individual health care policies without any financial assistance from the government and could face prohibitive increases. Taxpayers would end up spending more to subsidize premiums.  Earlier Thursday, Trump had directed government agencies to design a legal framework for groups of employers to band together and offer health insurance plans across state lines, a longstanding goal for the president.  ___  Associated Press Writer Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar contributed to this report.",3.4761904761904763,42,"[2.5, 4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 1.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.5, 0.5, 2.5, 5.0, 2.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 2.0, 5.0, 4.5, 2.0, 4.0, 0.5, 5.0, 3.0, 5.0, 2.5, 5.0, 2.0, 5.0, 4.5, 0.5, 3.5, 3.0, 4.5, 0.5, 5.0, 2.5, 3.0, 5.0, 4.0, 1.5]"

The House is on track to backing President Donald Trump's request for billions more in disaster aid, $16 billion to pay flood insurance claims and emergency funding to help the cash-strapped government of Puerto Rico stay afloat. The hurricane aid package Thursday, Oct. 12, 2017, totals $36.5 billion and sticks close to a White House request, ignoring - for now - huge demands from the powerful Florida and Texas delegations, who together pressed for some $40 billion more. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump lashed out at hurricane-devastated Puerto Rico on Thursday, insisting in tweets that the federal government can’t keep sending help “forever” and suggesting the U.S. territory was to blame for its financial struggles.  His broadsides triggered an outcry from Democrats in Washington and officials on the island, which has been reeling since Hurricane Maria struck three weeks ago, leaving death and destruction in an unparalleled humanitarian crisis.  San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, with whom Trump has had a running war of words, tweeted that the president’s comments were “unbecoming” to a commander in chief and “seem more to come from a ‘Hater in Chief.’”  “Mr. President, you seem to want to disregard the moral imperative that your administration has been unable to fulfill,” the mayor said in a statement.  The debate played out as the House passed, on a sweeping 353-69 vote, a $36.5 billion disaster aid package that includes assistance for Puerto Rico’s financially-strapped government. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said the government needs to ensure that Puerto Rico can “begin to stand on its own two feet” and said the U.S. has “got to do more to help Puerto Rico rebuild its own economy.”  Wildfires that raged across California wine country left little more than smoldering ashes and eye-stinging smoke in their wake. House after house is gone, with only brick chimneys and charred laundry machines to mark what were once homes. (Oct. 11)  White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders praised the House action Thursday night and promised the administration “will continue to work with Congress to provide the resources necessary to recover and rebuild from the hurricanes” and the wildfires in California.  Forty-five deaths in Puerto Rico have been blamed on Maria, about 85 percent of Puerto Rico residents still lack electricity and the government says it hopes to have electricity restored completely by March.  Both Trump and Vice President Mike Pence visited the island last week to reaffirm the U.S. commitment to the island’s recovery. But Trump’s tweets Thursday raised questions about whether the U.S. would remain there for the long haul. He tweeted, “We cannot keep FEMA, the Military & the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever!”  In a series of tweets, the president added, “electric and all infrastructure was disaster before hurricanes.” He blamed Puerto Rico for its looming financial crisis and “a total lack of accountability.”  The tweets conflicted with Trump’s past statements on Puerto Rico. During an event last week honoring the heritage of Hispanics, for example, the president said, “We will be there all the time to help Puerto Rico recover, restore, rebuild.”  White House chief of staff John Kelly, speaking to reporters, said the military and other emergency responders were trying very hard to “work themselves out of a job.” Reassuring the island, Kelly said the U.S. will “stand with those American citizens in Puerto Rico until the job is done.”  At the Pentagon, Lt. Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr. told reporters “there’s still plenty of work to be done” by the military troops in Puerto Rico. He said there was no current plan to withdraw troops who are supporting FEMA’s recovery efforts. McKenzie, director of the military’s Joint Staff, said it will be up to FEMA and other civilian agencies to decide when the military is no longer needed there.  Democrats said Trump’s tweets were deplorable, given that the 3 million-plus U.S. citizens on Puerto Rico are confronting the kind of hardships that would draw howls of outrage if they affected a state. One-third of the island lacks clean running water and just 8 percent of its roads are passable, according to government statistics.  “It is shameful that President Trump is threatening to abandon these Americans when they most need the federal government’s help,” said Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer, the second-ranking House Democrat.  After years of economic challenges, Puerto Rico was already in the process of restructuring much of its $74 billion in debt before the hurricane struck. The financial situation is more complicated than Trump’s tweets suggest.  Puerto Rico lost population and jobs after Congress eliminated special tax breaks in 2006, making it more difficult to repay its debts. Yet lenders continued to extend credit to Puerto Rico despite its economic struggles, while pension costs strained Puerto Rico’s government and its infrastructure deteriorated.  The legislative aid package totals $36.5 billion and sticks close to a White House request. For now, it ignores huge demands from the powerful Florida and Texas delegations, which together pressed for some $40 billion more.  A steady series of disasters could put 2017 on track to rival Hurricane Katrina and other 2005 storms as the most costly set of disasters ever. Katrina required about $110 billion in emergency appropriations.  The bill combines $18.7 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency with $16 billion to permit the financially troubled federal flood insurance program pay an influx of Harvey-related claims. An additional $577 million would pay for western firefighting efforts.  Up to $5 billion of the FEMA money could be used to help local governments remain functional as they endure unsustainable cash shortfalls in the aftermath of Maria, which has choked off revenues and strained resources.  Ryan, the House speaker, planned to visit Puerto Rico on Friday. He has promised that the island will get what it needs.  “It’s not easy when you’re used to living in an American way of life, and then somebody tells you that you’re going to be without power for six or eight months,” said Resident Commissioner Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon, who represents Puerto Rico as a nonvoting member of Congress. “It’s not easy when you are continue to suffer — see the suffering of the people without food, without water, and actually living in a humanitarian crisis.”  ___  Associated Press writers Josh Boak and Robert Burns contributed to this report.",3.074626865671642,67,"[4.5, 2.5, 0.5, 0.5, 3.5, 2.5, 4.0, 4.0, 1.0, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 3.0, 3.5, 0.5, 4.5, 3.5, 1.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.5, 2.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.5, 4.5, 2.0, 4.5, 2.5, 0.5, 5.0, 0.5, 5.0, 0.5, 4.0, 1.5, 4.5, 0.5, 5.0, 2.5, 4.5, 3.5, 0.5, 0.5, 5.0, 3.5, 3.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.5, 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 4.5, 5.0, 2.5, 5.0, 0.5, 5.0, 4.0]"

(AP Photo/Yuri Kageyama)  YOKKAICHI, Japan (AP) — At Toshiba’s flash-memory chip plant in Yokkaichi, the orderly quiet of the clean room, with its metal boxes zipping around on overhead rails, contrasts sharply with the messy feud between its owners over plans to sell this prized asset.  Toshiba plans to sell its memory chip business to a multinational consortium led by Bain Capital investment fund. The Japanese electronics and energy conglomerate’s U.S. joint venture partner Western Digital opposes the deal.  The plant in Yokkaichi, 290 kilometers (180 miles) southwest of Tokyo, makes highly lucrative SanDisk memory chips — the business Toshiba has agreed to sell to a consortium headed by investment company Bain Capital for 2 trillion yen ($18 billion).  Executives heading Toshiba Corp.’s memory business and Bain Capital Japan insisted Friday they will go ahead with the sale by March, if not earlier.  Toshiba Memory Chief Yasuo Naruke and Bain Japan chief Yuji Sugimoto led a media tour of the factory in Yokkaichi, an industrial hub in central Japan, where reporters were shown the site for planned construction of a new building to make state-of-the-art chips, called “3D.” That plan will go ahead with or without Western Digital’s consent or participation, they said.  The tour was clearly intended not only to highlight the plant’s technological prowess but also to demonstrate the unity between Bain and Toshiba Memory.  Tokyo-based Toshiba Corp. is suffering massive losses from its nuclear business. Its U.S. nuclear operations at Westinghouse Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy earlier this year.  To survive, Toshiba must part with the memory business, which it spun off in July as the last lucrative asset it has left to sell.  “Please check out how energetic we are at Yokkaichi,” Naruke told reporters. He emphasized that new investments are planned for the plant.  Channels for talks with Western Digital remain open, he said. He said he hoped for cordial relations and continued cooperation with the company.  Western Digital has filed in U.S. arbitration court in San Francisco to block the sale. The litigation is likely to take years, but a decision is expected soon on whether the sale would be suspended pending resolution of the case.  Western Digital has especially objected to South Korean rival SK Hynix’s involvement in the consortium buying Toshiba Memory. The consortium has said that intellectual property will not leak to Hynix, which is investing 395 billion yen ($3.5 billion) but doubts remain.  Western Digital, which also has a hard-disk drive business, said earlier this week that Bain has not contacted it and the two companies are not in talks. Bain declined comment on the denial.  The Bain-led consortium aims to list the NAND flash-memory SanDisk joint venture business on the Tokyo Stock Exchange within several years. Sugimoto has pledged to protect jobs at the memory business, keeping most of its management intact.  Competition from Samsung of South Korea, which is No. 1 in the memory chip field, is a major threat, and not falling behind in technology remains critical, he said.  Kota Ezawa, a financial analyst with Citigroup Global Markets in Tokyo, says selling the memory business is crucial for Toshiba, although it might have sought a better price. He also believes Western Digital might be bluffing to avoid losing control over the joint venture, protect its value and prevent damage to its own bottom line.  “What the arbitration court might decide is unknown,” he said. “The memory operation is the only major asset Toshiba has left to sell and it needs the sale to avoid delisting.”  Ezawa said the media tour Friday was likely intended to show that the Yokkaichi operation is largely run by Toshiba.  Bain’s consortium includes Apple Inc., a major customer for the memory chips, and Dell Technologies Capital. The two U.S. investors will not acquire common stock or voting rights over the business.  Japanese companies will hold 50.1 percent of the common stock in the consortium’s special company, with Toshiba investing 350 billion yen ($3.1 billion) and medical technology company Hoya Corp. investing 27 billion yen ($239 million).  Toshiba Memory also has been promised 600 billion yen ($5.3 billion) in financing from banks.  ___  Yuri Kageyama can be reached at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama  Her work can be found at https://www.apnews.com/search/yuri%20kageyama  ___  Yuri Kageyama can be reached at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama  Her work can be found at https://www.apnews.com/search/yuri%20kageyama",3.414285714285714,35,"[0.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.0, 5.0, 3.5, 3.0, 3.5, 5.0, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 2.5, 2.0, 1.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.0, 1.0, 4.5, 5.0, 2.5, 3.5, 4.0, 2.5, 4.5, 3.5, 2.0, 2.5, 4.0, 2.5]"

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)  WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on President Donald Trump’s executive order on health care (all times local):  11:15 p.m.  Congressional Democratic leaders say it will be an act of “vast, pointless sabotage” if President Donald Trump halts payments to insurers under “Obamacare.”  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi reacted Thursday night to news reports that Trump planned to stop the cost-sharing payments.  The Democrats say Trump “has apparently decided to punish the American people for his inability to improve our health care system.” They add that “millions of hard-working American families will suffer just because President Trump wants them to.”  The White House said in a statement Thursday night that the Department of Health and Human Services has determined there is no appropriation for cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers under the Obamacare law.  __  10:50 p.m.  President Donald Trump plans to halt payments to insurers under the Obama-era health care law that he has been trying to unravel for months.  That’s according to two people familiar with the decision who sought anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.  The White House says in a statement that the Department of Health and Human Services has determined there is no appropriation for cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers under the Obamacare law.  Trump’s decision is expected to rattle already-unsteady insurance marketplaces. The president has previously threatened to end the payments, which help reduce health insurance copays and deductibles for people with modest incomes, but remain under a legal cloud.  The president’s action is likely to trigger a lawsuit from state attorneys general, who contend the subsidies to insurers are fully authorized by federal law, and the president’s position is reckless.  — Ken Thomas and Catherine Lucey  ___  12 p.m.  President Donald Trump predicts “millions and millions of people” will benefit from his action to unwind the health care law.  He’s signed an executive order to make lower-premium plans more widely available.  But the changes Trump hopes to bring about could take months or even longer. That’s according to administration officials who outlined the order for reporters Thursday morning. The proposals may not be finalized in time to affect coverage for 2019, let alone next year.  White House domestic policy director Andrew Bremberg said that Trump still believes Congress needs to repeal and replace the Obama-era Affordable Care Act. The White House described the order as first steps.  Trump signed the order in the White House’s Roosevelt Room surrounded by Vice President Mike Pence, members of his Cabinet and Congress.  ___  11:55 a.m.  President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that aims to make lower-premium health care plans available to more Americans.  The president says the order will provide what he calls “Obamacare relief” for millions of Americans.  Trump is relying on the executive order because the Republican-controlled Congress has been unable to pass a plan to repeal and replace the Obama-era health care law.  Trump says the health care system “will get better” with his action, and the action will cost the federal government nothing.  The president says he still wants Congress repeal and replace the Obama health care law. But his says his order will give people more competition, more choices and lower premiums.  ___  3:38 a.m.  President Donald Trump has made no secret he’s frustrated with the failure of Congress to repeal and replace “Obamacare.”  Now Trump will try to put his own stamp on health care with an executive order that aims to make lower-premium insurance plans available to more consumers. He will unveil his plan Thursday.  Administration officials say it will let groups and associations sponsor coverage that can be marketed across the land, reflecting Trump’s longstanding belief that interstate competition will lead to lower premiums.  Trump’s move is likely to encounter opposition from medical associations, consumer groups and even insurers — the same coalition that has blocked congressional Republicans. They say it would raise costs for the sick, while the lower-premium coverage for healthy people would come with significant gaps.",3.5,3,"[5.0, 0.5, 5.0]"

The Associated Press has obtained a recording of what some U.S. Embassy workers heard in Havana, part of the series of unnerving incidents later deemed to be deliberate attacks. (AP Photo/Desmond Boylan, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — It sounds sort of like a mass of crickets. A high-pitched whine, but from what? It seems to undulate, even writhe. Listen closely: There are multiple, distinct tones that sound to some like they’re colliding in a nails-on-the-chalkboard effect.  The Associated Press has obtained a recording of what some U.S. Embassy workers heard in Havana in a series of unnerving incidents later deemed to be deliberate attacks. The recording, released Thursday by the AP, is the first disseminated publicly of the many taken in Cuba of mysterious sounds that led investigators initially to suspect a sonic weapon.  The recordings themselves are not believed to be dangerous to those who listen. Sound experts and physicians say they know of no sound that can cause physical damage when played for short durations at normal levels through standard equipment like a cellphone or computer.  What device produced the original sound remains unknown. Americans affected in Havana reported the sounds hit them at extreme volumes.  Whether there’s a direct relationship between the sound and the physical damage suffered by the victims is also unclear. The U.S. says that in general the attacks caused hearing, cognitive, visual, balance, sleep and other problems.  The recordings from Havana have been sent for analysis to the U.S. Navy, which has advanced capabilities for analyzing acoustic signals, and to the intelligence services, the AP has learned. But the recordings have not significantly advanced U.S. knowledge about what is harming diplomats.  The Navy did not respond to requests for comment on the recording. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert wouldn’t comment on the tape’s authenticity.  Cuba has denied involvement or knowledge of the attacks. The U.S. hasn’t blamed anyone and says it still doesn’t know what or who is responsible. But the government has faulted President Raul Castro’s government for failing to protect American personnel, and Nauert said Thursday that Cuba “may have more information than we are aware of right now.”  “We believe that the Cuban government could stop the attacks on our diplomats,” said White House chief of staff John Kelly.  Not all Americans injured in Cuba heard sounds. Of those who did, it’s not clear they heard precisely the same thing.  Yet the AP has reviewed several recordings from Havana taken under different circumstances, and all have variations of the same high-pitched sound. Individuals who have heard the noise in Havana confirm the recordings are generally consistent with what they heard.  “That’s the sound,” one of them said.  The recording being released by the AP has been digitally enhanced to increase volume and reduce background noise, but has not been otherwise altered.  The sound seemed to manifest in pulses of varying lengths — seven seconds, 12 seconds, two seconds — with some sustained periods of several minutes or more. Then there would be silence for a second, or 13 seconds, or four seconds, before the sound abruptly started again.  A closer examination of one recording reveals it’s not just a single sound. Roughly 20 or more different frequencies, or pitches, are embedded in it, the AP discovered using a spectrum analyzer, which measures a signal’s frequency and amplitude.  To the ear, the multiple frequencies can sound a bit like dissonant keys on a piano being struck all at once. Plotted on a graph, the Havana sound forms a series of “peaks” that jump up from a baseline, like spikes or fingers on a hand.  “There are about 20 peaks, and they seem to be equally spaced. All these peaks correspond to a different frequency,” said Kausik Sarkar, an acoustics expert and engineering professor at The George Washington University who reviewed the recording with the AP.  Those frequencies might be only part of the picture. Conventional recording devices and tools to measure sound may not pick up very high or low frequencies, such as those above or below what the human ear can hear. Investigators have explored whether infrasound or ultrasound might be at play in the Havana attacks.  The recordings have been played for workers at the U.S. Embassy to teach them what to listen for, said several individuals with knowledge of the situation in Havana. Some embassy employees have also been given recording devices to turn on if they hear the sounds. The individuals weren’t authorized to discuss the situation publicly and demanded anonymity.  Cuban officials wouldn’t say whether the U.S. has shared the recordings with Cuba’s government.  Another big question remains: Even if you know you’re under attack, what do you do? Still dumbfounded by what’s causing this, the United States has been at a loss to offer advice.  The embassy’s security officials have told staff if they believe they’re being attacked, they should get up and move to a different location, because the attack is unlikely to be able to follow them, the commenting individuals said. The AP reported last month that some people experienced attacks or heard sounds that were narrowly confined to a room or parts of a room.  The State Department has said 22 Americans are “medically confirmed” to be affected and that the number could grow. The symptoms and circumstances reported have varied widely, making some hard to tie conclusively to the attacks. The incidents began last year and are considered “ongoing,” with an attack reported as recently as late August.  Cuba has defended its “exhaustive and priority” response, emphasizing its eagerness to assist the U.S. investigation. Cuban officials did not respond to requests for comment for this story but have complained in the past that Washington refuses to share information they say they need to fully investigate, such as medical records, technical data and timely notification of attacks.  ___  Lederman reported from Washington.

557,1949,10,13,2017,2017-10-13,Associated Press News,Trump won’t pull out of ‘worst’ Iran nuclear deal _ for now," President Donald Trump on Friday angrily accused Iran of violating the landmark 2015 international nuclear accord, blaming the Iranians for a litany of sinister behavior and hitting their main military wing with anti-terror penalties. But Trump, breaking his campaign pledge to rip up the agreement, did not pull the U.S. out or re-impose nuclear sanctions.  He still might, he was quick to add. For now, he’s tossing the issue to Congress and the other world powers in the accord, telling lawmakers to toughen the law that governs U.S. participation and calling on the other parties to fix a series of deficiencies. Those include the scheduled expiration of key restrictions under “sunset provisions” that begin to kick in in 2025, as well as the omission of provisions on ballistic missile testing and terrorism.  Without the fixes, Trump warned, he would likely pull the U.S. out of the deal — which he has called the worst in U.S. history — and slap previously lifted U.S. sanctions back into place. That would probably be a fatal blow for the accord.  “Our participation can be canceled by me, as president, at any time,” Trump declared in a carefully delivered speech read from a teleprompter in the Diplomatic Reception Room at the White House. He added later, speaking of Congress, “They may come back with something that’s very satisfactory to me, and if they don’t, within a very short period of time, I’ll terminate the deal.”  Under U.S. law, Trump faces a Sunday deadline to certify to Congress whether Iran is complying with the accord. That notification must take place every 90 days, a timetable that Trump detests. Since taking office, he has twice reluctantly certified that Iran is fulfilling its commitments.  On Friday, he said he would not do so again.  Trump alone cannot actually terminate the accord, which lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for concessions regarding its nuclear program. But withdrawing the U.S. would render the deal virtually meaningless.  That would be risky, though, and could badly damage U.S. credibility in future international negotiations. The accord was struck after 18 months of negotiations between the Obama administration, Iran, Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the European Union and then endorsed by a unanimous vote in the U.N. Security Council.  Trump’s main national security aides have all argued for staying in the deal. So have key allies in Europe who are leery of altering an accord that they believe has prevented Iran from assembling an arsenal of atomic weapons.  Overseas reaction to Friday’s speech was swift.  Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said that his country would continue to stick to the nuclear deal and that the U.S. was isolating itself, “more lonely than ever,” by condemning the accord.  Indeed, the leaders of Britain, Germany and France urged Trump in a joint statement not to do anything rash.  “We encourage the U.S. administration and Congress to consider the implications to the security of the U.S. and its allies before taking any steps that might undermine the (deal), such as re-imposing sanctions on Iran lifted under the agreement,” they said. Still, they added, “Independent of the (deal) we need to make sure that our collective wider concerns are being addressed.”  In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Trump and said the U.S. president had created an opportunity to “fix this bad deal” and roll back Iran’s aggression. Netanyahu has long warned that the accord failed to address Iran’s support for militant groups who act against Israel.  Trump opened his speech by reciting a long list of grievances with Iran dating back to the 1979 Islamic Revolution and the seizure of the U.S. Embassy and American hostages in Tehran. He then noted terrorist attacks against Americans and American allies committed by Iranian proxies, such as Hezbollah, and Iran’s ongoing ballistic missile tests.  “We cannot and will not make this certification” that Iran is complying with the accord, he said. “We will not continue down a path whose predictable conclusion is more violence, more terror and the very real threat of Iran’s nuclear breakout.”  But “decertifying” the deal stops well short of pulling out and simply moves the issues over to Congress. Lawmakers now have 60 days to decide whether to put the accord’s previous sanctions back into place, modify them or do nothing.  Republicans face a heavy lift in rallying GOP lawmakers and Democrats behind legislation that would make the accord more stringent and please Trump. Some GOP senators, like Marco Rubio of Florida, question whether the pact can be fixed.  Further complicating matters, a GOP lawmaker who will be at the center of what’s sure to be a stormy debate is Bob Corker of Tennessee, who recently compared Trump’s White House to “an adult day care center” and said the president could be setting the U.S. on a path toward World War III.  Ahead of Trump’s speech, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the administration wants lawmakers to come up with legislation that would automatically re-impose sanctions that were lifted under the deal should Iran cross any one of numerous nuclear and non-nuclear “trigger points.”  Those would include illicit atomic work or ballistic missile testing; support for Syrian President Bashar Assad, Lebanon’s Hezbollah movement and other groups that destabilize the region, or human rights abuses and cyber warfare, Tillerson said.  Also Friday, Trump said he was hitting Iran’s Revolutionary Guard with sanctions for supporting terrorism. But the U.S. is not adding the Guard to the formal U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations. That step would force the U.S. to take even further steps against the Guard that Tillerson says could be problematic.  ___  AP writers Deb Riechmann and Richard Lardner contributed to this report.",3.9,5,"[4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 2.5]"

The European Space Agency’s Sentinel-5P satellite was launched Friday by a Rokot missile from the Plesetsk launch pad in northwestern Russia. The satellite will map the global atmosphere every day, helping study air pollution. (ESA via AP)  MOSCOW (AP) — Russia successfully launched a satellite into orbit Friday that will monitor Europe’s atmosphere, helping to study air pollution.  The European Space Agency’s Sentinel-5P satellite was launched by a Rokot missile from the Plesetsk launch pad in northwestern Russia. The satellite will map the atmosphere every day.  After separating from the upper stage booster, the satellite deployed its solar panels and began communications with Earth, the ESA said. The first signal was received 93 minutes after launch as the satellite passed over the Kiruna station in Sweden.  Controllers at ESA’s operations center in Darmstadt, Germany, then established command and control links allowing them to monitor the satellite’s condition.  “The Sentinel-5P satellite is now safely in orbit so it is up to our mission control teams to steer this mission into its operational life and maintain it for the next seven years or more,” ESA Director General Jan Woerner said in a statement.  The mission will contribute to volcanic ash monitoring for aviation safety and for services that warn of high levels of UV radiation causing skin damage. The measurements also will help understand processes in the atmosphere related to the climate and to the formation of holes in the ozone layer.  It’s the sixth satellite in the ESA’s Copernicus program. Other Earth-observing Sentinel satellites launched earlier provide radar and optical imagery of the Earth, and monitor the condition of the world’s oceans and ice sheets.  “Having Sentinel-5P in orbit will give us daily and global views at our atmosphere with a precision we never had before,” ESA quoted Josef Aschbacher, the head of its earth observation programs, as saying.  Philippe Gaudy, who oversees the Sentinel project for the European Space Agency, said data collected by Sentinel 5P would help scientists to better monitor air pollution, such as for nitrogen oxide emitted by cars.  A recent report estimated that more than 400,000 people die prematurely in Europe alone because of air pollution.  Orbital observation can be used to compare reported air pollution by governments with actual data, to see whether countries are living up to their commitments under international treaties, Gaudy said.  The data from Sentinel-5P will be made available for free to anyone who wants it, he added.  It will take engineers several months to calibrate and validate the measurements, meaning data will start to become available in the first half of next year.",3.75,2,"[5.0, 2.5]"

Gusting winds and dry air forecast for Thursday could drive the next wave of devastating wildfires that are already well on their way to becoming the deadliest and most destructive in California history. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg)  SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Smoke from the wildfires north of San Francisco plunged air quality levels in the Bay Area to the same unhealthy level as China’s notoriously polluted capital, sending people to emergency rooms and forcing schools to close and people to wear masks when they step outside.  The region has endured days of choking smoke since the fires began Sunday night and claimed at least 31 lives and destroyed thousands of homes and businesses. The smoke cast a dull haze over San Francisco’s scenic skyline, and poor visibility has led to numerous flight delays and cancellations at the city’s airport.  Air quality in most of the region Thursday and Friday was as bad as smog-choked Beijing, according to the Bay Area Air Quality Management District.  “We have unprecedented levels of smoke and particles in the air that we normally don’t see,” said Ralph Borrmann, a spokesman for the district.  He called it the worst air quality ever recorded in many parts of the Bay Area.  Since Wednesday, about 15 percent of flights in and out of San Francisco International Airport experienced delays because air traffic controllers have had to separate aircrafts at a greater distance, airport spokesman Doug Yakel said Friday.  Officials warned that very fine smoke particles, thinner than a human hair, can get lodged in the lungs and into the bloodstream, causing irreparable damage to the body. In Solano County, hospitals there received more than 250 people who complained of toxic air inhalation, county health officer Bela Matyas said Thursday.  At an Ace Hardware store in San Francisco’s financial district, phones were ringing nonstop with customers looking to buy breathing masks. But they were sold out, as were most stores in the area.  With winds expected to keep blowing in smoke from the fires to populated areas this weekend, many schools decided to close Friday. Organizers canceled weekend events, including an Oktoberfest in Walnut Creek and a fitness festival and half marathon in San Francisco.  Sports teams are monitoring the air quality as they prepare to host games.

Wild turkeys have bounced back in New England in what's considered a success story for wildlife restoration. But as they spread farther into urban areas, they're increasingly coming into conflict with humans who say they ravage gardens, damage cars and attack people. (AP Photo/Collin Binkley)  BOSTON (AP) — Not everyone is celebrating the return of the wild turkeys.  After being wiped out from New England in the 1800s, the birds have stormed back in what’s considered a major success story for wildlife restoration. But as they spread farther into urban areas, they’re increasingly clashing with residents who say they destroy gardens, damage cars, chase pets and attack people.  Complaints about troublesome turkeys have surged in Boston and its suburbs over the past three years, causing headaches for police and health officials called to handle problems, according to city and town records provided to The Associated Press. It’s a familiar dilemma for some other U.S. towns from coast to coast that have been overrun by turkeys in recent years.  Boston city officials say they received at least 60 complaints last year, a threefold increase over the year before. Nearby Somerville, Belmont and Brookline have seen similar upticks, combining for a total of 137 turkey gripes since the start of last year.  “Several years ago it was more of an isolated situation here and there,” said David Scarpitti, the wild turkey and upland game biologist for the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife. “Now it’s starting to spread into communities all around Boston.”  Wild turkeys are increasingly clashing with their human neighbors as they spread out into urban areas. New England's turkey population has rebounded, but some residents complain that the birds ruin gardens, damage cars and even attack people. (Oct. 13)  Often the grievance is little more than a wayward turkey blocking traffic, but in at least five cases turkeys became so aggressive that police said they had to shoot them as a matter of public safety. Some area residents have suffered minor injuries from the birds, including a 72-year-old woman who told police she was bruised in August after a gang of turkeys scratched and pecked her during a walk.  Turkeys in the wild are far stronger and faster than the ones that land on Thanksgiving tables, experts say. Males in particular are driven to show physical aggression as a way to climb the social pecking order, and they sometimes view humans as potential competitors.  “Turkeys don’t really mean to harm people — it’s just tied to their social dynamics within the flock,” Scarpitti said. “They lose perspective that humans are humans and turkeys are turkeys. They just want to assert dominance over anything.”  Even the earliest Americans picked up on that characteristic, with Ben Franklin famously writing that the turkey is a “Bird of Courage, and would not hesitate to attack a Grenadier of the British Guards who should presume to invade his Farm Yard with a red Coat on.”  In the town of Brookline, Tess Bundy has come to loathe the turkeys that roost behind her home and often come charging when she leaves. She called police in April after a big tom repeatedly launched itself at her and her infant daughter, backing down only after Bundy whacked it several times with a shovel.  “They’re terrible. Every year they’re worse,” said Bundy, a history professor at Merrimack College. “I really do think that they’re a menace to the town.”  The complaints have sent some cities searching for answers, including in Cambridge, where the City Council says it’s working on a plan. Officials in Brookline issued new guidance for fowl encounters in August, telling residents to “step toward the turkey and act confidently.”  Wildlife experts say much of the problem can be blamed on residents who leave out food for turkeys, which entices flocks to settle in and helps them survive winters.  Towns with similar problems in New Jersey, Iowa and Oregon have banned turkey feeding in recent years, and Montana enacted a similar statewide ban in May. But the idea hasn’t spread to the Boston area, where some residents say they enjoy the return of native wildlife.  Not far from two sites where turkeys were shot by police, Brookline resident Suzette Abbott says she’s had no problems with the turkeys that roam her block.  “I don’t think they’re dangerous,” Abbott said. “In the spring they look pretty amazing when the males are displaying their colors. I think they’re quite beautiful if you actually look at their feathers.”  ___  Follow Collin Binkley on Twitter: @cbinkley.",3.7,5,"[4.0, 3.5, 5.0, 2.5, 3.5]"
589,1985,10,14,2017,2017-10-14,Associated Press News,Global finance leaders warn against complacency,"White House senior adviser Ivanka Trump accompanied by World Bank President Jim Yong Kim speaks at the forum Taking Women-Owned Business to the Next Level, on the sidelines of the World Bank/IMF annual meetings in Washington, Saturday, Oct. 14, 2017. ( AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Global finance leaders on Saturday appealed to central bankers to stick as long as possible with low-interest rate policies that have made borrowing attractive and helped safeguard an improving but still fragile world economic recovery.  Declaring the “recovery is not complete” even eight years after the 2008 financial crisis, the 189-nation International Monetary Fund wrapped up its fall meetings with a communique warning “there is no room for complacency” as nations confront new challenges to global growth from a range of threats, including cyber-security attacks and more violent weather patterns linked to climate change.  The meetings also dealt, at least on the sidelines, with efforts to better understand the policy implications of the Trump administration’s more forceful “America First” agenda.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he had productive discussions during nearly 20 one-on-one meetings with other countries plus the joint sessions of the IMF and World Bank policy committees, as well as two days of talks centered on the Group of 20 major industrial countries.  Donald Trump won the presidency with pledges to toughen enforcement of U.S. trade laws and trim huge U.S. trade deficits with nations such as China and Mexico, which Trump has accused of unfair trade practices that have cost millions of American manufacturing jobs.  Mnuchin said he agreed with an assessment of German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble that the discussions this week were more relaxed than the initial talks held earlier this year, when the Trump team had first taken office, because there was a better understanding of Trump’s goals.  “We believe in free and fair and reciprocal trade,” Mnuchin told reporters Saturday, saying the Trump administration is simply trying to make sure U.S. workers and companies are treated fairly in trade deals with other nations.  Mnuchin said he carried in his pocket a list of all the G-20 nations and the size of the trade balances the United States has with each of those nations. With most of the G-20 countries, the United States is running a trade deficit.  Schauble, the chairman of the G-20 finance group this year, said he believed the backlash against globalization was giving way to a greater understanding that the path toward rising prosperity for all depends on greater cooperation among countries.  But the Trump administration so far has been highly skeptical of various multilateral organizations. This week, the United States pulled out of UNESCO, the United Nations’ cultural agency. It has scrapped an Asia-Pacific trade deal and is threatening to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. And it is has balked at providing additional capital to the World Bank unless the anti-poverty agency rethinks the way it distributes loans.  In his speech Saturday to the IMF policy group, Mnuchin said he wanted to see the IMF be a more “forceful advocate” for strong global growth by imposing more stringent surveillance on the economic policies being pursued by its member countries and by taking a hard look at changes that needed to be made by countries running large trade surpluses.  While the IMF communique called on major central banks to protect the global recovery by being cautious in withdrawing the support it has had in place since the 2008 financial crisis, in many cases the trend seems to be moving in the opposite direction.  In the United States, the Federal Reserve has raised short-term interest rates twice this year and is beginning to reduce its large portfolio of bonds, a move that could push long-term rates higher. In Europe, the euro currency has risen since spring on expectations that the European Central Bank will withdraw its long-standing stimulus program. The ECB meets Oct. 26.  “Monetary policy should remain accommodative, where inflation is still below target and output gaps” still exist, the communique said.

590,1986,10,13,2017,2017-10-13,Associated Press News,Boeing and Airbus sales of planes to Iran safe for now,"Boeing and Airbus sales of planes to Iran safe for now  President Donald Trump’s decision not to re-impose sanctions against Iran is good news for Boeing and its European rival, Airbus, which can continue doing business with Iranian airlines that are desperate for new planes.  Between them, Boeing and Airbus have announced deals with Iranian airlines that, if finalized, could cover nearly 300 planes worth $40 billion.  Still, those numbers pale in comparison to standing orders at both companies. Boeing has a backlog of orders that would take more than eight years to fill even if it never made another sale. Airbus has a similarly long list.  “This isn’t a make-or-break type of thing for either company, but it is definitely good for both Boeing and Airbus,” said Douglas Harned, a Bernstein analyst who tracks Chicago-based Boeing Co.  Boeing declined to comment beyond a brief statement saying that it follows U.S. guidelines and is in close touch with regulators regarding sales to Iran. Airbus declined to comment.  Iran wants to modernize its ancient, accident-prone aviation industry. Years of Western sanctions prevented Iranian airlines from buying new planes from Boeing and Airbus, the duo that dominate the global aircraft-manufacturing market. Iran also has had trouble buying spare parts for planes that date to the 1970s.  The 2015 agreement negotiated by the Obama administration lifted some sanctions on Iran and cleared the way for aircraft sales. Both Boeing and Airbus need U.S. Treasury Department permission for such sales — in the case of Airbus, which is not a U.S. company, that is because some of its airplane components come from U.S. suppliers.  Even without the re-imposed sanctions, however, hurdles still remain. Richard Aboulafia, an analyst with Teal Group, an aviation and defense consulting firm, said the Iranian airlines could yet have trouble financing their orders, partly because banks are unlikely to loan them money until Iran signs the Cape Town Agreement, an international treaty that includes provisions for repossessing capital assets like planes.  And American politics could still play a role, with Trump leaving it to Congress to consider next steps.  Some in Congress, including Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., want to stop the aircraft sales to Iran. In September, the House approved a measure to block Treasury from approving future aircraft deals and possibly hinder the Iranians’ ability to finance pending purchases. The bill’s fate in the Senate is uncertain.  Boeing and Airbus currently have firm contracts to sell 180 planes to Iran — 100 by Airbus, 80 by Boeing — and tentative deals for more planes.  — In December 2016, Boeing said it signed a contract with Iran Air for the sale of $16.6 billion worth of planes — 30 large 777s typically used on long routes and 50 737 Max 8s, a new version of Boeing’s workhorse short-haul plane.  — The same month, Airbus finalized a deal with Iran Air for 100 planes worth more than $18 billion at list prices; A320s, A330s and A350s.  — In April, just over two months after Trump was sworn in, Boeing said Aseman Airlines signed its intent to buy 30 737 Max jets worth $3 billion, and an option for 30 more. The sale has not been finalized, according to a Boeing spokesman.  — In June, Airbus said Airtour Airlines and Zagros Airlines had committed to buy 73 planes worth $2.5 billion.  Those figures are list prices — Iran would likely pay Boeing and Airbus far less — and would be spread over many years. And the sales themselves don’t amount to a huge chunk of business when considering Boeing’s revenue in 2016 was $94.6 billion and Airbus took in 66.6 billion Euros ($78.7 billion).  “The numbers are basically insignificant — planes, revenue, jobs,” Aboulafia said. “You never know, it might get bigger, but it certainly doesn’t look very impressive.”  Harned, the Bernstein analyst, said that while both aircraft manufacturers have bigger business elsewhere, Iran Air’s order of Boeing 777s is particularly important in helping shore up production levels of that plane, a two-aisle, widebody jet that is frequently used on long international routes.  Sales of the plane have been slowing, and Boeing is cutting production from more than eight per month a couple years ago to 3.5 per month. The two models of the 777 that Iran Air ordered list at $347 million and $409 million each — although airlines routinely get big discounts — and losing those sales prices would mean less revenue and fewer jobs at Boeing.  Boeing has said that demand will be adequate to support production of 3.5 777s per month even without Iran, but keeping that order on the books “makes the backlog more robust,” Harned said.  ___  David Koenig can be reached at http://twitter.com/airlinewriter",2.7560975609756095,41,"[1.5, 1.5, 2.5, 1.0, 3.5, 0.5, 3.0, 1.0, 4.5, 2.5, 4.0, 2.0, 4.0, 1.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0, 5.0, 0.5, 4.5, 4.0, 2.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 0.5, 3.0, 0.5, 4.5, 3.5, 0.5, 1.5, 0.5]"

President Donald Trump’s former chief strategist Steve Bannon is boosting multiple challengers to GOP incumbents and the party’s preferred candidates in next year’s midterm elections(AP Photo/Brynn Anderson, File)  JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Steve Bannon has a stark message to Republican incumbents he considers part of the establishment: “Nobody can run and hide.”  President Donald Trump’s former chief strategist is promoting a field of potential primary challengers to take on disfavored Republicans in Congress and step up for open seats. Among the outsiders: a convicted felon, a perennial candidate linked to an environmental conspiracy theory and a Southern lawmaker known for provocative ethnic and racial comments.  It’s an insurgency that could imperil Republican majorities in the House and Senate. Bannon called it a “populist nationalist conservative revolt” in a speech to religious conservatives in Washington on Saturday.  The emerging Bannon class of rabble-rousers shares limited ideological ties but a common intent to upend Washington and knock out Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., standard-bearer of the establishment.  So intent is Bannon on bringing down McConnell that he laid down this marker Saturday to some of the incumbents at risk of a challenge from his flank of the party: disavow McConnell, satisfy other conditions and possibly escape the wrath.  “Until that time,” he said, the message to the elite is: “They’re coming for you.”  The crop of outsider candidates unnerves a GOP that lost seats — and a shot at the Senate majority — in 2010 and 2012 with political novices and controversial nominees and fears a stinging repeat in 2018.  “The main thing that binds them together is a rejection of the Republican Party establishment, a rejection of the political elites, the financial elites and the media elites,” said Andy Surabian, a former Bannon aide and senior adviser to the pro-Trump PAC Great America Alliance.  Bannon told the religious conservatives that economic nationalism and anti-globalism, the same forces he said elected Trump, can overpower Republican elites.  “This is our war,” he said. “The establishment started it. ... You all are gonna finish it.”  To escape it, he suggested, Senate incumbents can oppose McConnell, eliminate the filibuster that he says is impeding Trump’s agenda and denounce Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, a Republican who gave a scorching appraisal of Trump as an untethered leader who could lead the U.S. into another world war.  Bannon singled out John Barrasso of Wyoming, Deb Fischer of Nebraska and Dean Heller of Nevada as senators who “vote the right way” but did not step up to condemn Corker. There’s still time for a “mea culpa,” he said, implying such senators could be spared his insurgency if they toed his line.  Senate Republicans had been upbeat about adding to their 52-48 majority, especially with Democrats defending more seats next year, 10 in states Trump won in last year’s presidential election.  But the Bannon challenge could cost them, leaving incumbents on the losing end in primaries or GOP candidates roughed up for the general election.  Bannon helped elevate twice-suspended Judge Roy Moore, who won an Alabama runoff over McConnell’s pick, Sen. Luther Strange. Moore was removed from office for refusing to remove a Ten Commandments monument from Alabama’s judicial building, then suspended for insisting probate judges refuse same-sex couples marriage licenses. He faces Democrat Doug Jones in a December election where polls find a single-digit lead for the Republican, a remarkable development in Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ heavily GOP state.  In West Virginia, the grassroots conservative group Tea Party Express endorsed Patrick Morrissey, also a Great America Alliance choice, over establishment favorite Rep. Evan Jenkins in a competitive race to unseat Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin.  Consider Mississippi, where state Sen. Chris McDaniel lost to veteran Sen. Thad Cochran in 2014, but is weighing a bid next year against Roger Wicker, the state’s other senator in the national legislature.  McDaniel misdefined “mamacita,” the Spanish word for mommy, as “hot mama,” and said he would withhold his tax payments if the government paid reparations for slavery — comments he made years earlier as a radio host but critics unearthed during the campaign. He also denounced a supporter who photographed and posted an image of Cochran’s bed-ridden wife in 2014.  He argued in court that his loss to Cochran was due in part to Democrats, many of them African-American, fraudulently voting in the primary. He’s back again and speaking in Bannon terms.  “They will do anything, they will say anything, to just maintain a hold on power,” McDaniel said in an Associated Press interview about McConnell and his allies.  In Arizona, former state Sen. Kelli Ward, who is challenging Trump antagonist Sen. Jeff Flake, remains known for entertaining the debunked theory that jet aircraft are used to affect the weather or poison people intentionally.  Former New York Rep. Michael Grimm, who spent eight months in prison for federal tax evasion, is challenging two-term Rep. Dan Donovan — with the encouragement of Bannon.  In announcing his candidacy, Grimm was apologetic for his conviction. Still out there are viral videos of him telling a television reporter during an on-camera interview at the U.S. Capitol after a question he didn’t like: “You ever do that to me again, I’ll throw you off this (expletive) balcony.”  House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., is sticking with the incumbent: “I support Dan Donovan, plain and simple,” Ryan said this past week.  But he stopped short of suggesting Bannon stand down. “It’s a free country,” he said.  In Nevada, Bannon is encouraging Republican Danny Tarkanian in his challenge to Heller. Tarkanian, son of famed basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian, is 0-5 in state and federal elections.  These outsiders share strong opposition to increasing the nation’s debt even if it means an economy-rattling default. They also share unsparing criticism of congressional Republicans, especially McConnell, for failing to dismantle the Obama-era health care law, an unfulfilled seven-year-old promise.  In Wyoming, Erik Prince, founder of security contractor Blackwater, is considering a Republican primary challenge to Barrasso, a senior member of the Senate GOP leadership team.

593,1989,10,14,2017,2017-10-14,Associated Press News,Trump leaves Republicans with heavy lift on Iran deal,"Pedestrians make their way on a sidewalk in downtown Tehran, Iran, Saturday, Oct. 14, 2017. President Donald Trump's refusal to certify the Iran nuclear deal has sparked a new war of words between the Islamic Republic and America, fueling growing mistrust and a sense of nationalism among Iranians. (AP Photo/Vahid Salemi)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Republicans demanded a major say on the Iran nuclear agreement two years ago and never got it from Democrat Barack Obama. Now that President Donald Trump has directed Congress to make the international pact more stringent, the GOP is finding that having that voice won’t be easy.  Republicans will have to win over skeptical Democrats and key allies in Europe who are wary of altering the accord that they believe has prevented Iran from assembling an arsenal of atomic weapons in exchange for lifting economic sanctions. Republican leaders also may face resistance from members of their own party.  Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said Friday he’ll reserve judgment on any legislation but has “serious doubts about whether it is even possible to fix such a dangerously flawed agreement.”  Trump on Friday angrily accused Iran of violating the spirit of the nuclear deal that was forged with the U.S. and other world powers in 2015, blaming Tehran for a litany of malign behavior and hitting its main military wing with anti-terrorism sanctions. But the president, breaking with a campaign pledge to rip up the agreement, said he was not yet ready to pull the U.S. out or re-impose nuclear sanctions.  Instead he kicked the issue to Congress and told them to toughen the law.  Taking the lead will be the Republican whom Trump has been feuding with — Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. Trump belittled Corker this past week with a series of tweets and erroneously blamed the senator, who will retire at the end of next year, for the original Iran deal. Corker dubbed the White House an “adult day care center” and charged that Trump could be setting the nation on the path to world war.  Corker, in a conference call with reporters on Friday, focused on perhaps the most significant task of his chairmanship and didn’t address the bitter back and forth with Trump.  He previewed the main elements of legislation he is developing with Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., a national security hawk who has echoed Trump’s more confrontational approach toward Iran, to toughen the nuclear accord and the law governing U.S. participation in the deal.  “Over the last several months, we have been working closely with the State Department, National Security Council and Senator Cotton to develop a legislative strategy to address bipartisan concerns about the (Iran deal) without violating U.S. commitments,” Corker said in a statement.  On the call, Corker promised an open legislative process.  “You’re going to see all this evolve in daylight,” he said, adding that the bill could be introduced in the next two weeks.  The legislation would amend a two-year-old law that allowed Congress to review the accord. It would reduce from four to two the number of times a year Trump is required to certify to Congress that Iran is complying with the terms of the agreement.  It would also rid the deal of sunset provisions, which expire after predetermined periods of time. The provisions relate to enriching uranium to levels near those needed to produce the fuel for a nuclear weapon, as well as other activities that limit Iran’s atomic capabilities at various sites. The bill would propose a mechanism to automatically restore the prior U.S. sanctions if Iran gets within a year of acquiring a nuclear weapon.  The emerging bill also would give the International Atomic Energy Agency greater power to verify that Iran is complying with the deal.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., welcomed Trump’s decision and cast it as an opportunity for Congress to strengthen the law it passed in 2015 and “create a standard for certification that is consistent with our interests.”  Democrats condemned Trump’s announcement and criticized him for punting presidential responsibilities to Congress just as he did on health care and extending protection from deportation for young immigrants known as “Dreamers.”  Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, the top ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, issued a sharply worded statement that called Trump’s move a “reckless, political decision” that put U.S. national security at risk. He said the president and his Cabinet should be principally in charge of addressing concerns about the Iran deal.  “Instead, he is abdicating his leadership role to Congress, just like with Dreamers and just like with affirming and strengthening our health care system,” said Cardin, who opposed the nuclear deal two years ago but is now opposed to ditching the pact. “It is a troubling pattern. We will not buy into the false premise that it is Congress’ role to legislate solutions to problems of his own making.”  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called Trump’s move a “grave mistake.”  Without changes, Trump warned, he would probably pull the U.S. out of the deal — which he has called the worst in U.S. history — and snap previously lifted sanctions back into place.  ___  Follow Richard Lardner on Twitter at http://twitter.com/rplardner",2.5,4,"[4.5, 4.5, 0.5, 0.5]"
594,1990,10,13,2017,2017-10-13,Associated Press News,Analysis: Trump embraces turmoil as strategy," Unable or unwilling to completely erase his predecessor’s signature initiatives, President Donald Trump this week turned to another approach: wreaking havoc.  Trump’s back-to-back body blows against President Barack Obama’s health care law and nuclear agreement with Iran demonstrated the president’s embrace of turmoil as strategy. In both cases, he plunged a pair of policies with broad domestic and international implications into a state of confusion and uncertainty, hoping that the disorder will force Congress to take action.  Trump has long thrived on unpredictability, an attribute he views as a virtue. But to the lawmakers, foreign partners, businesses and consumers now sorting through the implications of his announcements this week, the strategy looks far less appealing.  International allies who spent years negotiating the nuclear accord alongside the U.S. are now left waiting to see if Congress will reinstate nuclear sanctions on Tehran, a move certain to jettison the deal. Trump didn’t specifically ask for the sanctions to be put back in place. But, in a speech declaring he would no longer certify the deal, he did ask lawmakers to add new, unspecified conditions for U.S. cooperation in the agreement.  On health care, millions of Americans face the prospect of higher insurance premiums as a result of Trump’s decision to immediately halt payments to insurance companies that provide lower-cost plans to low-income people. Trump calls the payments a bailout to insurance companies and he cited as justification a legal dispute over whether the payments were legally authorized. Trump yanked the money without any plan in place for offsetting cost increases for customers. Insurance companies, too, are at the mercy of lawmakers, who must now decide whether to restore the payments.  “We are going to have to figure out a way to stabilize the situation,” said Rep. Charlie Dent, a Pennsylvania Republican who dubbed the move “ill-advised.” Democrats branded it sabotage. The president was “determined to inject chaos and confusion” into the health care system, said Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat.  As a businessman, a candidate and now as president, Trump has gravitated toward chaos. His campaign was rife with bitter internal rivalries, often stoked by the man at the top of the ticket. His West Wing has careened from crisis to crisis and endured more staff upheaval in nine months than some presidents experience in a full term.  Still, Trump has made clear he sees unpredictability as an advantage. Indeed, his vague statements — “we’ll see,” he often says when asked about looming decisions — and seemingly improvisational policy positions can leave his political rivals maddeningly frustrated. He’s vowed to keep international adversaries off balance with diversionary tactics or a simple lack of transparency about U.S. actions — a goal some foreign diplomats say he has indeed fulfilled.  Trump’s approach, however, hasn’t yet translated into success when it comes to making good on his vows to overhaul some of the cornerstones of Obama’s legacy, including the Iran deal and the health care law, that have long loomed as targets for Republicans. As a candidate, he promised to rip up the Iran deal on his first day in office. He boasted that overhauling health care would be “easy.”  Health care has proven to be anything but simple. Even with Republicans in charge on Capitol Hill, the GOP has been unable to muster the votes to muscle through an “Obamacare” replacement package. Lawmakers’ impotence has deeply frustrated Trump and left him casting about for ways to undermine the law on his own.  Thursday’s announcement halting the subsidies for insurance companies marked Trump’s most aggressive move yet to chip away at the law. Eliminating the payments would trigger a spike in premiums for some Americans next year, unless Trump reverses course or Congress authorizes the money, a step that would almost certainly require the kind of bipartisanship that has been absent on Capitol Hill this year.  In a sign of the potential difficulties to come, Trump appeared to pre-emptively blame Democrats if no deal is reached, tweeting that they should “call me to fix!” And Democratic leaders made clear they would turn the blame-game back around on the president.  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said she wanted voters to know “what it means in their lives when he goes off on a spiteful, cruel toot to diminish their access to affordable care.”  Trump also has been angered by his struggle to roll back the Iran nuclear accord Obama vigorously championed. Amid warnings from his advisers about the risks of withdrawing from the accord, he ordered national security advisers to help him find a way to avoid having to certify Iran’s compliance with the deal every 90 days.  That plan, which Trump announced from the White House on Friday, still falls short of scrapping the agreement. Instead he asked Congress to toughen the law that governs U.S. participation and fix what he sees as deficiencies in the measure.  Trump’s half step followed weeks of pleas from allies who argue Trump cannot pull out of a deal that was negotiated alongside Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China. Federica Mogherini, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, declared Friday: “The president of the United States has many powers. Not this one.”  For allies looking for reassurances that Trump was done threatening to withdraw from the Iran deal, he offered nothing but more uncertainty.  “We’ll see what happens over the next short period of time,” Trump said.  _  Editor’s Note: Julie Pace has covered the White House and politics for the AP since 2007.

Still out there are viral videos of him telling a television reporter during an on-camera interview at the U.S. Capitol after a question he didn’t like: “You ever do that to me again, I’ll throw you off this (expletive) balcony.”  House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., is sticking with the incumbent: “I support Dan Donovan, plain and simple,” Ryan said this past week.  But he stopped short of suggesting Bannon stand down. “It’s a free country,” he said.  In Nevada, Bannon is encouraging Republican Danny Tarkanian in his challenge to Heller. Tarkanian, son of famed basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian, is 0-5 in state and federal elections.  These outsiders share strong opposition to increasing the nation’s debt even if it means an economy-rattling default. They also share unsparing criticism of congressional Republicans, especially McConnell, for failing to dismantle the Obama-era health care law, an unfulfilled seven-year-old promise.  In Wyoming, Erik Prince, founder of security contractor Blackwater, is considering a Republican primary challenge to Barrasso, a senior member of the Senate GOP leadership team. Bannon has urged Prince, brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, to run.  Bannon has given at least one Senate incumbent — Texas Sen. Ted Cruz — a pass, but not others.  ___  Beaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.",4.6,5,"[4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0]"

Trump presented a distorted picture of his tax plan this past week and claimed he was trying to keep the Obama health law’s insurance markets afloat even as he took steps that could well sink them. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump presented a distorted picture of his tax plan this past week and claimed he was trying to keep the Obama health law’s insurance markets afloat even as he took steps that could well sink them.  A look at his statements on a grab-bag of hot topics spanning the economy, Iran, health care and the way he treats his subordinates:  TRUMP on President Barack Obama’s health overhaul: “What we’re doing is trying to keep it afloat, because it’s failing.” — Forbes interview, conducted Oct. 6 and reported this past week.  THE FACTS: Days later, Trump pulled the plug on payments to insurers that are critical to making copayments and deductibles more affordable in the subsidized individual insurance market. Barring a reversal by Congress, the courts or administration policy, the move probably will drive up costs substantially for many in the health exchanges, send insurers fleeing from the already troubled marketplace, or both. Trump makes no secret of his wish to repeal the Affordable Care Act. But he had been casting a lifeline to those exchanges by making the payments month to month. Now he’s yanked that back.  Trump also directed his administration to rewrite federal rules to ease the way for “association health plans” that could offer cheaper coverage with fewer protections than are guaranteed in the law’s health plans. That, too, potentially undermines the 2010 law. Furthermore, his administration said before this week that it is sharply cutting programs that promote health insurance enrollment under the law for next year.  ___  TRUMP: “I’m giving the largest tax cuts in the history of this country.” — comments Tuesday after meeting Henry Kissinger.  THE FACTS: His tax plan is, at most, fifth largest in its estimated cost, says Marc Goldwein of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. It could end up being even lower on the ladder historically.  The estimated cost of the tax plan has dropped by half or more since the spring, when only the contours were known. In an analysis in April, Goldwein’s group found that the $5.5 trillion plan that was then expected would have been the third largest since 1940 as a share of gross domestic product, behind President Ronald Reagan’s package in 1981 and tax cuts enacted in 1945 to phase out revenue generated for World War II. But, citing estimated costs of $1.5 trillion to $2.5 trillion for Trump’s plan now, Goldwein said several other historically significant tax cuts also would surpass Trump’s: from 2013 and 1964.  ___  TRUMP: “Since the election on November 8th, I’ve increased the value of your U.S. assets by more than the $20 trillion that we currently owe.” — comparing rising values with the national debt, in a speech Wednesday to truckers in Pennsylvania.  THE FACTS: Trump’s suggestion that his election is the solitary explanation for higher stock and home prices does not reflect how the economy works. Trump’s election and the promise of a tax overhaul certainly helped the stock market at first. But recent gains also reflect better global growth and other factors that are beyond the president’s control.  Most Americans’ primary asset is their home, and there is little evidence that home values are rising because of Trump’s presidency. Much of the increase in home values reflects a dwindling supply of properties on the market relative to demand from would-be buyers. People’s net worth has improved because mortgage debt is being repaid, increasing the equity they have in their homes.  Meantime, the International Monetary Fund expects world economic growth will reach a six-year high this year. Three-quarters of the globe is experiencing growth, the first synchronized worldwide upswing in a decade. That’s a big boost for U.S. companies that earn much of their money overseas, and a lift for the U.S. stock market.  Also, people’s rising stock and home values do not mean a paying down of the federal government’ debt.  ___  TRUMP: “When it comes to the business tax, we are now dead last among developed nations. Our rate is the least competitive rate. We have the highest tax rate anywhere in the world. How foolish is this?” — Pennsylvania speech.  THE FACTS: This is a misleading picture and one he paints continually. The U.S. does have the highest statutory corporate tax rate, but that doesn’t tell the full story. Other countries with lower corporate taxes also charge a separate tax on consumption, known as a Value Added Tax, that lets them keep corporate rates lower. The overall tax burden in the United States is among the lowest in the developed world.  ___  TRUMP: “We are nearly doubling the amount of income that is based at the zero bracket.” Democrats are “not telling you the truth, because they pretend there isn’t a zero rate. And there is, and it’s expanding very substantially under my plan.” — Pennsylvania speech.  THE FACTS: Some people who accept that statement at face value are bound to get sticker shock at tax time, if his plan is adopted.  With the “zero” tax rate, Trump is talking about his proposed doubling of the standard deduction. While the higher standard deduction would exclude the first $24,000 in family earnings from taxes, the plan would also get rid of the personal exemption. The loss of the exemption would expose some families — particularly larger ones — to higher taxes than the doubling of the standard deduction.  ___  TRUMP: “The Iranian regime has committed multiple violations of the agreement. For example, on two separate occasions, they have exceeded the limit of 130 metric tons of heavy water.” — remarks Friday criticizing Iran’s behavior while stopping short of pulling the U.S. out of the nuclear agreement.  THE FACTS: Iran is meeting all its obligations under the deal that suspended its nuclear program in return for eased international sanctions, according to International Atomic Energy Agency investigators. They did note some minor violations that were quickly corrected.  Trump is right that Iran exceeded the limit on heavy water in its possession on two occasions. Both times international inspectors were able to see that Iran made arrangements to ship the excess out of the country so that Tehran could come back into compliance.  Supporters of the deal argue that this shows the agreement works. Opponents say that because Iran sells the surplus on the open market, it is therefore being rewarded for violating the deal.  Trump and other critics of the agreement point in particular to Iran’s continuing missile tests, which may or may not defy the U.N. Security Council resolution that enshrined the deal. But those tests do not violate the deal itself.  ___  TRUMP: “I will tell you, I left Texas and I left Florida, and I left Louisiana, and I went to Puerto Rico, and I met with the president of the Virgin Islands. These are people that are incredible people.” — speech to religious conservatives Friday.  THE FACTS: He met the governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Kenneth Mapp, not a president. It’s not a country so it doesn’t have a president. He correctly referred to the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico as territories. At a congressional hearing a day earlier, Energy Secretary Rick Perry called Puerto Rico “a country that already had its challenges before the storm,” and apologized when told of the flub.  ___  TRUMP: “I don’t believe in undercutting people.” — comments to the press Tuesday, when asked about Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.  THE FACTS: If a boss’s public disparagement of those who work for him counts as undercutting, Trump undercuts.  He used Twitter to undercut Tillerson’s diplomatic outreach to North Korea (“save your energy, Rex”), then suggested he’s got a higher IQ than his chief diplomat. This, after NBC News reported that Tillerson had described Trump as “moron.”  Trump also used Twitter and other forums in the summer to humiliate his “very weak” and “beleaguered” attorney general, Jeff Sessions.  If publicly disparaging political associates counts as undercutting, too, the list is very long.  He barked at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to “get back to work” after the collapse of an effort to repeal the health law; said Republican senators “look like fools”; and branded Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., “Liddle’ Bob Corker” after the senator slammed him on multiple fronts.  Consciously or not, Trump’s energy-saving advice to Tillerson and his comment on Corker’s height recalled the taunts he directed against his 2016 Republican primary rivals, “low energy” Jeb Bush and “Little Marco” Rubio, the Florida senator.  Trump spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders argued it’s impossible for a president to undercut his Cabinet because “the president is the leader of the Cabinet. He sets the tone, he sets the agenda.”  ___  TRUMP: “The Failing @nytimes set Liddle’ Bob Corker up by recording his conversation. Was made to sound a fool, and that’s what I am dealing with!” — tweet Tuesday.  THE FACTS: The Times wasn’t sneaky in recording the interview. Corker asked that he be recorded, mentioning that his aides were also on the line: “I know they’re recording it, and I hope you are, too,” he told his interviewer. He also said: “I understand we’re on the record.” Corker said in the interview that Trump risked putting the U.S. on a path to world war and treated his office like a reality TV show.  ___  TRUMP: “So GDP last quarter was 3.1 percent. Most of the folks that are in your business, and elsewhere, were saying that would not be hit for a long time. You know, Obama never hit the number.” — interview with Forbes magazine.  THE FACTS: Yes, Obama did, repeatedly. Growth topped 3 percent in eight quarters during Obama’s presidency.  When Forbes pointed out that Obama had reached that benchmark, Trump amended his claim: “He never hit it on a yearly basis.”  That’s true. The economy never grew by more than 3 percent for a full calendar year under Obama. That hasn’t happened since 2005. It is unlikely to happen this year, either.  ___  TRUMP: “I’ve had just about the most legislation passed of any president, in a nine-month period, that’s ever served. We had over 50 bills passed. I’m not talking about executive orders only, which are very important. I’m talking about bills.” — Forbes interview.  THE FACTS: He’s signed little of consequence into law, a thin record all the more striking because of the Republican majority in the House and Senate. His record pales not just next to Franklin Roosevelt’s but with Obama’s and others. Trump, like his predecessors, has signed a lot of routine legislation, naming federal buildings after people and the like. He’s also signed emergency hurricane aid into law.  But the only far-reaching bill he’s signed is one he didn’t like but went along with, tightening sanctions on Russia and Iran. His promised repeal and replacement of Obama’s health care law has yet to materialize after twice failing in Congress. His proposed tax overhaul is in play, not in place, and the big-ticket infrastructure initiative he promised hasn’t come to Congress.  ___  TRUMP: “Now, we’re going to have to do something with Obamacare because it’s failing. Henry Kissinger does not want to pay 116 percent increase in his premiums, but that’s what’s happening.” — after meeting Kissinger on Tuesday.  THE FACTS: Kissinger is going to be OK. The 94-year-old former secretary of state and national security adviser, chairman of his own international consulting firm and prolific author, is surely not bothered by rising premiums. People on Medicare can’t sign up for the insurance exchanges anyway.  But what to make of Trump’s suggestion that people in the exchanges are seeing premiums rise 116 percent? That comes from one state, Arizona, where unsubsidized premiums for a hypothetical 27-year-old buying a benchmark plan under Obama’s law increased 116 percent this year, according to an earlier government estimate. That cost, however, could be reduced significantly with subsidies available to low- and moderate-income people.  ___  WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS: “Sen. Corker worked with Nancy Pelosi and the Obama administration to pave the way for that legislation and basically rolled out the red carpet for the Iran deal.” — briefing Tuesday.  TRUMP tweet Oct. 8: “He is also largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal!”  THE FACTS: Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, had no role in crafting the 2015 international agreement forged by the U.S. and other world powers to constrain Iran’s ability to build a nuclear arsenal. Corker actually was a vocal opponent of the accord and argued Obama should have made the international pact a treaty subject to approval by the Senate.  When Obama didn’t do that, Corker helped fellow senators write legislation that subjected the accord to periodic congressional review. The legislation would have stopped the deal from moving forward if that effort got enough votes. It didn’t. In any event, the ultimate decision to bring the deal into effect was made by Obama, not Congress.  ___  Associated Press writers Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, Donna Cassata, Christopher S.

( AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)  WASHINGTON (AP) — The world economy is the healthiest it’s been in years but could still use a little help from low-interest rates and higher government spending from countries that can afford it, the International Monetary Fund says.  “There was a strong consensus that the global outlook is strengthening,” said Agustin Carstens, governor of the Bank of Mexico and outgoing chair of the IMF’s policy committee. “This does not mean we are declaring victory just yet.”  The 189-member IMF and its sister agency, the World Bank, wrapped up three days of meetings Saturday.  The IMF expects the global economy to grow 3.6 percent this year, up from 3.2 percent in 2016. And three-quarters of the global economy is growing, making this the broadest recovery in a decade.  But IMF and World Bank officials pointed to risks that could derail global growth. Geopolitical risks are rising, including a confrontation between the United States and North Korea over Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons program. The income gap between rich and poor is growing, fueling political discontent with the free trade and global cooperation that the IMF and World Bank promote.  So in a communique Saturday, the IMF’s policy committee called on world central banks to protect the fragile global recovery by keeping interest rates down in countries where inflation is too low and economies are performing below potential.  IMF officials have also urged some countries with healthy finances — such as Germany and South Korea — to make investments that will spur growth.  IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde appealed to countries to enact reforms that will make their economies more efficient and spread prosperity to those who have been left behind. Specifically, Lagarde argued that countries could improve their economies and reduce inequality by putting more women to work, improving their access to credit and narrowing their pay gap with men.  On Saturday, Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and a White House adviser, appeared with World Bank President Jim Yong Kim to launch a World Bank initiative to support women entrepreneurs. The World Bank fund has raised $350 million which is designed to allow the World Bank to deploy at least $1 billion in capital to finance women-owned businesses.  Ivanka Trump told the audience that she wanted to “spend a lot of time offering any value that I can as a mentor.”  The World Bank and IMF delegates are still adjusting to the Trump administration, which is skeptical of international organizations and contemptuous of free trade agreements. This week, the United States pulled out of UNESCO, the United Nations’ cultural agency. It is has balked at providing additional capital to the World Bank unless the anti-poverty agency rethinks the way it distributes loans. It has scrapped an Asia-Pacific trade deal and is threatening to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he carried in his pocket a list of all the G-20 nations and the size of the trade balances the United States has with each of those nations. With most of the G-20 countries, the United States is running a trade deficit.  In a speech Saturday to the IMF policy group, Mnuchin said he wanted to see the IMF be a more “forceful advocate” for strong global growth by taking a harder look at countries that abuse world trade rules.",4.125,4,"[4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5]"
626,2024,10,14,2017,2017-10-14,Associated Press News,US agency’s bid to allow trumpeter swan hunting draws fire," In this March 25, 2015, file photo, a pair of trumpeter swans stretch and preen on ice along a channel of open water at Westchester Lagoon in Anchorage, Alaska. No state currently has hunting seasons for trumpeter swans, which have made a comeback in recent decades thanks to efforts to reintroduce them. Now the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is working on a plan aimed at letting hunters shoot them legally in certain states that allow the hunting of tundra swans. (AP Photo/Dan Joling, File)  MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A federal plan to let hunters shoot trumpeter swans has drawn fire from some of the people who toiled to bring the majestic white birds back from the brink of extinction.  Trumpeter swans, North America’s largest waterfowl species, have made a comeback in recent decades thanks to efforts to reintroduce them to their former breeding range. Now the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is working on a plan that would let hunters shoot them in several states that allow the hunting of tundra swans, a more numerous species.  “Trumpeter swans are a conservation success story,” said Brad Bortner, chief of the service’s migratory bird management division. North America’s population is estimated at more than 63,000 adult birds and it’s growing by more than 10,000 a year, he said.  No state is currently proposing trumpeter swan seasons, he said, and the proposal is mostly aimed at protecting tundra swan hunters in five states who may mistakenly kill trumpeter swans. But he acknowledged the proposal opens the door to the possibility that some states could offer such a hunting season. The soonest the proposal could take effect is 2019-2020 season.  Tundra swans look almost identical to trumpeter swans, especially at a distance, and a tundra swan hunter who mistakenly shoots a trumpeter is subject to a fine. That rarely — if ever — happens. But the risk is expected to grow as trumpeter swans spread from states that have invested heavily in restoration efforts, such as Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin and Michigan in the Mississippi Flyway.  The proposal essentially would make such incidental kills legal by letting states with low trumpeter numbers hold general swan seasons rather than specific tundra swan seasons. The service already allows something similar in the Pacific Flyway in Utah and Nevada. The new plan would most directly protect tundra swan hunters in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, North Carolina and Virginia.  But that approach doesn’t sit well with some bird lovers, including the man who led the restoration effort in Minnesota, where the trumpeter swan population has grown over the past 35 years from none to more than 20,000. Carrol Henderson, supervisor of the Nongame Wildlife Fund at the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, personally brought back the eggs from Alaska that seeded the state’s flock in the 1980s.  Speaking for himself, not the state agency, Henderson said he fears the federal plan puts at risk a population that Minnesota brought back using about $500,000 raised through a program that lets people contribute by filling in a box on their income tax forms. He said the state pledged that the trumpeters would never be hunted, and he said waterfowl hunters are turned off by the idea of hunting them.  “If a proposal were made to turn it into a game species, I think the agency would suffer a huge black eye,” he said.  The Fish and Wildlife Service put the plan out for public comments this summer. Officially, it’s called a “draft environmental assessment” for a “proposal to establish a framework for general swan hunting seasons in the Atlantic, Mississippi and Central flyways.” The online comment period closes Sunday. As of Friday, the comments were running heavily against any trumpeter swan hunting, though one Minnesota tribe supports the proposal because trumpeters have grazed so heavily on one of its best wild rice lakes that they’ve become pests.  Henderson recommended maintaining the existing ban on swan hunting in the Mississippi Flyway. In the Atlantic and Central flyways, which include the five states the plan is aimed at, he would change the rules so game wardens would confiscate trumpeter swans accidentally shot by hunters, but not fine the hunters. He said Minnesota did that for a goose species that was once protected.  “I’m not sure that sort of simplicity is something that flies well in Washington, but it worked here in Minnesota,” he said.  ___  Sign up for the AP’s weekly newsletter showcasing our best reporting from the Midwest and Texas: http://apne.ws/2u1RMfv",3.0,3,"[0.5, 5.0, 3.5]"
627,2025,10,16,2017,2017-10-16,Associated Press News,Correction: Kansas-Leaking Gas story," In a story Oct. 14 about leaking gas wells, The Associated Press reported erroneously that Kansas Gas Service owns the nearby Yaggy gas storage field. Kansas Gas Service owned the facility at the time of the 2001 Hutchinson explosions, but the company no longer owns it.  A corrected version of the story is below:  Gas leaking from Kansas wells amid dispute over who must fix  Natural gas is leaking through unplugged abandoned wells that have penetrated a massive underground storage field in Kansas  By ROXANA HEGEMAN  Associated Press  WICHITA, Kan. (AP) — Natural gas is leaking through unplugged abandoned wells that have penetrated a massive underground storage field in Kansas, creating a public safety hazard amid a dispute over who is responsible for fixing the problem, regulatory filings show.  Northern Natural Gas Co., which owns the underground storage facility, wants the Kansas Corporation Commission, which regulates oil and gas drilling in the state, to force well owners to plug abandoned wells. But the commission said in a filing last month that Northern Natural is responsible for making sure its natural gas isn’t escaping from the wells — and it asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to order the company to take “remedial action.”  Officials are aware of the dangers of not fixing the problem. A series of explosions in 2001 in Hutchinson involving leaking natural gas from another company’s underground storage field killed two people and damaged the city. In that case, natural gas migrated from the Yaggy Storage Field northwest of Hutchinson and shot up through unplugged salt brine wells.  Yet Northern Natural Gas told federal regulators in a recent filing that the Kansas Corporation Commission “has sat on its hands with full knowledge of the risk, and has been complicit by allowing the wells to remain unplugged.”  In an emailed statement, the state commission said it “recognizes these are very serious issues for our state.” The Kansas agency declined to more directly respond to assertions in the company’s filing, citing pending litigation.  The dispute involves the Cunningham Storage Field, a depleted natural gas reservoir that was converted into a storage area for natural gas supplies. The wells in question are in an area that Northern Natural acquired through condemnation proceedings in 2010 after it discovered its gas had migrated, something that is not unusual for such storage fields. The wells were capturing some of Northern’s stored gas, and as a part of the compensation drillers were also awarded $3,000 per well to either plug their wells or seal them off from Northern’s supplies. No money has been paid out yet because the case was appealed.  The fact that wells weren’t plugged became an issue in April, when a farmer spreading fertilizer on his field struck the surface pipe of one well, unleashing an outburst of gas and liquids. The farmer turned off his vehicle, the gas did not ignite and no one was hurt. But the well owner refused to take responsibility for extinguishing the blowout, according to the Kansas Corporation Commission. Northern also said it had no obligation to act.  The commission called in experts to extinguish the blowout and plug the well, costing Kansas $166,030, the agency said. The commission inspected other abandoned wells in the storage field, and found two that have been leaking gas for at least three months.  Northern contends in its filing that five unplugged wells above its field are a safety risk. The company did not learn of the two leaking wells until the commission filed its motion, and the agency has still not told the company which wells are leaking, Northern spokesman Michael Loeffler said.  “We don’t want our facilities to be unsafe. We have spent hundreds of millions of dollars in integrity issues over the years to ensure the safety of our pipeline. And then you have someone like the KCC who is charged with the responsibility of keeping us safe and they really are complicit with allowing this situation to continue,” Loeffler said.  Kansas has 17 underground natural gas storage facilities, according to the commission. Cunningham Storage Field spans parts of Pratt, Kingman and Reno counties. The Yaggy Storage Field is nearby and was owned at the time of the 2001 explosions by Kansas Gas Service Co.  Kansas Gas Services’ then-owner, Tulsa, Oklahoma-based ONEOK Inc., reached a settlement with families of the people who died in 2001. A jury later awarded damages to some homeowners.  ___  Sign up for the AP’s weekly newsletter showcasing our best reporting from the Midwest and Texas: http://apne.ws/2u1RMfv",3.875,4,"[3.0, 3.5, 5.0, 4.0]"
628,2026,10,14,2017,2017-10-14,Associated Press News,Northern Michigan University offers marijuana degree," A university in Michigan is offering an unusual degree — in marijuana.  Northern Michigan University in Marquette began its medical plant chemistry program this semester, with about a dozen students in the first class, the Detroit Free Press reported . The program combines chemistry, biology, botany, horticulture, marketing and finance.  It’s an unusual program. Other universities offer classes on marijuana policy and law. And places such as Oaksterdam University, Cannabis College, and Humboldt Cannabis College, all in California; and THC University, the Grow School and Clover Leaf University in Denver offer certificates in a variety of disciplines. But Northern Michigan’s program is unique because the university is offering a four-year degree addressing the science and business behind growing marijuana.  “When they hear what my major is, there are a lot of people who say, ‘Wow, cool dude. You’re going to get a degree growing marijuana,’” said Alex Roth, a sophomore in the program. “But it’s not an easy degree at all.”  Brandon Canfield, an associate chemistry professor at Northern Michigan, said students don’t grow marijuana plants in the program, but instead look to other plants that are traditionally recognized with medicinal value but aren’t illegal to grow. Students learn how to measure and extract the compounds in the plants that can be used for medicinal purposes, then transfer that knowledge to marijuana, which has been used to treat a variety of illnesses, including chronic pain, nausea, seizures and glaucoma.  Canfield said he got the idea while attending the American Chemical Society’s annual meeting in San Diego last year.  “It was my off day and I saw there was a cannabis chemistry group that was putting on a whole series of talks,” he said. “I heard all about the need for analytical chemists and all sorts of interesting talks. That was the initial spark.”  University officials say the program fills a need because 29 states have legalized medical marijuana, including eight states where marijuana is also legal for recreational use.  “Many of the states are legalizing different substances and they’re really looking for quality people to do the chemistry and the science,” said university trustee James Haveman. “And it’s the university’s responsibility to produce those kinds of students for those kinds of jobs.”  In Michigan, voters in 2008 approved the use of marijuana to treat certain illnesses, but the law has confused many and has led to significant legal disputes, including over how to obtain and store the drug. The state is developing a new regulatory system aimed at increasing oversight and imposing new taxes on the industry.

Big Adventures!"" Formerly six boys and one girl, the new team will have three girls and four boys. (Mattel, Inc. via AP)  NEW YORK (AP) — Girls are finally getting a bigger role in Thomas the Tank Engine’s boy-dominated world.  Mattel, the toy maker that owns the Thomas brand, will add two female main characters to the “Thomas & Friends” TV series next year. Nia and Rebecca will appear in each episode and help fix the gender imbalance at the shed where Thomas and the other main characters live: Three of the seven engines at Tidmouth Sheds will be female, up from just one.  The gender shakeup is just one of the many changes coming to the 30-year-old show. Thomas visits real countries for the first time; the animation will move at a faster pace; there’s a new theme song; the characters will crack more jokes; and the narrator will be gone, replaced by the voice of Thomas.  It’s all an effort to shake Thomas’ stodgy image, compete with flashier preschool shows and fight a drop in toy sales. It’s a big risk for the franchise, which got its start as a book series more than 70 years ago. To avoid any missteps, Mattel consulted with parents, young fans and even the United Nations. In all, the company spent two years working on the makeover.  “It’s such a huge shift,” said Kate Schlomann, a vice president of branding at Mattel. “We want to make sure we’re here another 70 years.”  Girls are finally getting a bigger role in Thomas the Tank Engine’s boy-dominated world. The gender shakeup is just one of the many changes coming to the 30-year-old show to shake Thomas’ stodgy image and fight a drop in toy sales. (Oct. 14)  Nia, an engine from Kenya, will make her debut next summer in the movie “Big World! Big Adventures!” and then join the TV series in the fall. Experts at the U.N. advised producers with Nia’s name (it means “purpose” in Swahili) and helped select the African pattern that runs across Nia’s body.  “When you’re designing an engine from any country, you want to be spot on,” said Schlomann.  Rebecca’s origins are less exotic. She’ll come from the Mainland near Thomas’ fictional island of Sodor. She’ll first appear on screens in the TV series next fall. Henry and Edward will get the boot from Tidmouth Sheds to make room for the two new girls, but the boy engines will still appear on the show from time to time. (Mattel refers to the characters as girls and boys, even though they are engines.) Producers wanted Nia and Rebecca to have starring roles, and they’ll join Emily, who has been the only girl engine among the crew of main characters for about 13 years. Other girls in Thomas’ universe have had smaller roles.  “We have added new female characters before, but I think, with a show like Thomas, they tend to fall into the background after initial introduction,” said Ian McCue, a “Thomas & Friends” producer. “What we wanted to do here was really bring these two female characters to the forefront.”  Thomas will meet other female characters, such as an airplane in Australia. And in India, there’s a female train controller in charge of the railway, another first for the show, Mattel said.  “Gender equality is something that’s really important to us in this new series and going forward,” said producer Micaela Winter.  Viewership of “Thomas & Friends” is evenly split between girls and boys, Mattel said, and girls are more likely than boys to watch every week. But the brand hasn’t catered to them. Girls will be in more Thomas toy commercials and on the box. Nia toys will be on sale next fall after the movie release, and Rebecca toys will follow in 2019. More T-shirts, pajamas and bed sheets will be aimed at girls.  “I think it’s actually giving them what they want,” said Schlomann.  Mattel has made changes to its other toy brands in an attempt to be more inclusive and appeal to today’s parents. Barbie and Ken dolls now come in different skin colors, body shapes and hair types. And the first boy doll was added to the American Girl lineup earlier this year.  Mattel took control of “Thomas & Friends” five years ago, after it bought production company Hit Entertainment for $680 million. Since then, it has tried to put its stamp on the brand. Engines from India and China, for example, rode into Sodor last year to add some diversity and appeal to viewers who live in the 110 countries that watch “Thomas & Friends.”  But Thomas has big competition from shows on Disney Junior and Nick Jr., whose characters are also in toy stores with Thomas. Mattel said in July that second-quarter sales at its Fisher-Price unit, which Thomas is a part of, slipped 3 percent compared to the same period the year before. “Our Thomas business remains challenged,” said Mattel Inc. Chief Operating Officer Richard Dickson in a July conference call with investors. But he said there were a couple of new opportunities for the franchise, including girls.  As for Thomas, Mattel said it was fans who wanted the blue engine to get out of Sodor more often.  “One was a little boy saying, ‘Trains can go anywhere, but Thomas never goes anywhere,’” said McCue. “That really got us thinking.”  Thomas will spend half of the 26 TV episodes on railroads in other countries, such as Australia and China. Producers and writers met with the U.N., which has an office that works with movie and TV productions, to help represent different cultures, such as when Thomas takes part in the Chinese New Year.  “It’s really about learning about the world and bringing the world into the living room for a preschooler,” said Schlomann. “Which we haven’t done before.”  _____  Associated Press video journalist James Brooks in London contributed to this report.  _____  Contact Joseph Pisani at http://twitter.com/josephpisani",3.2083333333333335,48,"[5.0, 3.0, 5.0, 2.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.0, 0.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 2.5, 2.0, 4.0, 2.0, 1.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 0.5, 4.0, 4.0, 0.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 2.5, 2.5, 2.0, 1.5, 5.0, 4.0, 0.5, 3.5, 3.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 2.0, 0.5, 3.5]"

It comes after recent reports by The New York Times and The New Yorker that revealed sexual harassment and rape allegations against Weinstein going back decades. The move by the Academy is virtually unprecedented. (Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP, File)  LOS ANGELES (AP) — In a move virtually unprecedented, disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein’s membership in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was revoked Saturday by its board.  The decision was reached in an emergency session by the academy, the world’s top movie organization and home to the Oscars. The expulsion was effective immediately.  It comes after recent reports by The New York Times and The New Yorker about sexual harassment and rape allegations against Weinstein going back decades. He has denied the accusations against him.  In issuing its decision, the academy stated “We do so not simply to separate ourselves from someone who does not merit the respect of his colleagues but also to send a message that the era of willful ignorance and shameful complicity in sexually predatory behavior and workplace harassment in our industry is over.”  “What’s at issue here,” the statement added, “is a deeply troubling problem that has no place in our society.”  The statement said the decision was reached by “well in excess of the required two-thirds majority” of the 54-member academy board.  Only one person is thought to have been previously expelled from the academy: Carmine Caridi, a character actor who had his membership revoked in 2004 for lending DVD screeners of films in contention for Oscars that ended up online.  The academy’s swift and severe ruling against Weinstein may raise questions about other academy members who remain in good standing. These include Roman Polanski, an Oscar-winner who in the 1970s pleaded guilty to drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl, and entertainer Bill Cosby, who has faced dozens of allegations of sexual assault.  Weinstein, himself an Oscar winner as a producer of the 1998 Best Picture “Shakespeare in Love,” was ousted a week ago from The Weinstein Co., the movie and TV production company he co-founded with his brother Bob and which now is struggling to survive the scandal.  In an interview published Saturday by The Hollywood Reporter, Bob Weinstein called for his “sick and depraved’ brother to be kicked out of the academy.  Speaking more broadly, Bob Weinstein added, “I want him to get the justice that he deserves.”  On Wednesday, Harvey Weinstein’s membership in the British Academy of Film and Television Arts was revoked.  In a related development, British actress Lysette Anthony says she has told police that Weinstein raped her in London in the 1980s.  It was reported this week that London police were investigating a rape allegation against the producer relating to an incident in the ’80s. The city’s Metropolitan Police confirmed it was investigating a sexual assault allegation from that decade, without identifying Weinstein by name.  Anthony, who currently appears in the soap opera “Hollyoaks,” told the Sunday Times newspaper that Weinstein raped her in the late 1980s after showing up at her London home. She said she was left feeling “disgusted and embarrassed” after the attack.

President Donald Trump’s daughter is speaking at a conference in Washington that’s rolling out the World Bank’s Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative — a program she’s pushed the bank to introduce.  It’s raised $350 million, and hopes to turn that into $1 billion in financing for businesses owned by women. The initiative will make entrepreneurs available to offer advice.  Ivanka Trump — a business owner herself — is promising “to spend a lot of time offering any value that I can as a mentor.”  ___  12:20 p.m.  The Trump administration says the International Monetary Fund needs to be a more “forceful advocate” and push countries to follow economic policies that will promote better growth.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin (mih-NOO’-shin) says the U.S. wants to see the 189-nation IMF do a better job of ensuring that countries with big trade surpluses lower those surpluses. That’s seen as a way of boosting global growth.  President Donald Trump has singled out China for criticism about its trade surpluses. He’s suggested the Chinese are relying on unfair trade practices to help Chinese companies at the expense of American exporters.  Mnuchin tells the IMF — which is wrapping up its fall meetings in Washington — that it “must be a more forceful advocate for strong, sustainable and balanced growth.”  ___  2:35 a.m.  The leaders of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank are vowing to fight climate change, combat income inequality and push back against rising populist skepticism over free trade and international collaboration.  IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde says, “We know from experience that international cooperation works — from reconstruction after World War II more than 70 years ago to fighting Ebola just a few years back.”  The IMF and World Bank wrap up three days of meetings Saturday. Finance ministers from the G-20 major economies concluded two days of talks Friday.  Lagarde says world leaders must take advantage of healthy growth to devise policies that make sure prosperity reaches those who are being left behind.

According to research released Sunday Oct. 15, 2017, by environmental group WWF, scientists say a “catastrophic breeding failure” occurred when thousands of chicks from an Adelie penguin colony died of starvation last summer when adult penguins were forced to travel further for food, with only two chicks surviving the existential phenomena. (AP Photo/Brian Witte, FILE)  BERLIN (AP) — Almost the entire cohort of chicks from an Adelie penguin colony in the eastern Antarctic was wiped out by starvation last summer in what scientists say is only the second such incident in over 40 years.  Researchers said Sunday the mass die-off occurred because unusually large amounts of sea ice forced penguin parents to travel farther in search of food for their young. By the time they returned, only two out of thousands of chicks had survived.  “Not only did the chick starve but the partner (who stayed behind) also had to endure a long fast,” said Yan Ropert-Coudert, a marine ecologist with the French science agency CNRS.  Ropert-Coudert, who leads the study of seabirds at the Dumont D’Urville Antarctic research station, said the Adelie colony there numbers about 18,000 pairs who have been monitored since the 1960s. A similar breeding loss was observed for the first time during a 2013-2014 research expedition.  “It is unusual because of the size of the population concerned,” he said in an email to The Associated Press. “Zero breeding success years have been noted before elsewhere, but never for colonies of this size.”  Sea ice extent in the polar regions varies each year, but climate change has made the fluctuation more extreme.  The environmental group WWF, which supported the research, urged governments meeting in Hobart, Australia, this week to approve a new marine protection area off East Antarctica. Rod Downie, head of polar programs for the group’s British branch, said the impact of losing thousands of chicks was dramatic for an otherwise hardy species such as Adelie penguins.  “It’s more like ‘Tarantino does Happy Feet’, with dead penguin chicks strewn across a beach in Adelie Land,” he said.  Ropert-Coudert said creating a protection zone in the D’Urville Sea-Mertz region, where the colony is located, wouldn’t prevent larger-than-usual sea ice, but it might ease the pressure on penguins from tourism and over-fishing.",3.8125,8,"[3.5, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.0, 0.5, 5.0]"
659,2059,10,16,2017,2017-10-16,Associated Press News,Collins: Trump should back effort to resume health subsidy,"Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, smiles during a news conference Friday, Oct. 13, 2017, in Rockland, Maine, after announcing she will remain in the U.S. Senate and not run for governor. (AP Photo/David Sharp)  WASHINGTON (AP) — A key moderate Republican is urging President Donald Trump to support a bipartisan Senate effort to reinstate insurer payments, calling his move to halt the subsidies an immediate threat to millions of Americans who could now face rising premiums and lost health care coverage.  “What the president is doing is affecting people’s access and the cost of health care right now,” said Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who has cast pivotal votes on health care in the narrowly divided Senate. “This is not a bailout of the insurers. What this money is used for is to help low-income people afford their deductibles and their co-pays.”  “Congress needs to step in and I hope that the president will take a look at what we’re doing,” she added.  Her comments Sunday came amid rising attention on the bipartisan bid led by Sens. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Patty Murray, D-Wash., to at least temporarily reinstate the payments.  Congressional Republicans are divided over the effort. And White House budget director Mick Mulvaney has suggested that Trump may oppose the agreement unless he gets something in return — such as a repeal of former President Barack Obama’s health care law or funding of Trump’s promised wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.  The insurer payments will be stopped beginning this week, with sign-up season for subsidized private insurance set to start Nov. 1.  “The president is not going to continue to throw good money after bad, give $7 billion to insurance companies unless something changes about Obamacare that would justify it,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who golfed with Trump Saturday at the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia.  “It’s got to be a good deal,” Graham said.  In his decision last week, Trump derided the $7 billion in subsidies as bailouts to insurers and indicated he was trying to pressure Democrats into negotiating an Obamacare repeal, a bid that repeatedly crashed in the GOP-run Senate this summer.  The subsidies are designed to lower out-of-pocket costs for insurers, which are required under Obama’s law to reduce poorer people’s expenses — about 6 million people. To recoup the lost money, carriers are likely to raise 2018 premiums for people buying their own health insurance policies.  Alexander and Murray have been seeking a deal that the Tennessee Republican has said would reinstate the payments for two years. In exchange, Alexander said, Republicans want “meaningful flexibility for states” to offer lower-cost insurance policies with less coverage than Obama’s law mandates.  On Sunday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., described Trump’s demand for a sit-down with congressional Democratic leaders as “a little far down the road,” noting that nothing in Trump’s proposals to repeal Obamacare indicates what would replace it. Pelosi pointed to the bipartisan effort in the Senate and said ultimately it will be up to a Republican-controlled Congress and executive branch whether the federal government can avert a shutdown by year’s end.  The government faces a Dec. 8 deadline on the debt limit and government spending.  “We’re not about closing down government. The Republicans have the majority,” Pelosi said. “In terms of the health care, we’re saying ‘Let’s follow what Sens. Murray and Alexander are doing.’”  “They’re trying to find common ground, and that should be encouraged,” she added.  The scrapping of subsidies would affect millions more consumers in states won by Trump last year, including Florida, Alabama and Mississippi, than in states won by Democrat Hillary Clinton. Nearly 70 percent of the 6 million who benefit from the cost-sharing subsidies are in states that voted for the Republican.  Republican Gov. John Kasich of Ohio said Sunday his state had anticipated that the insurer payments would be halted, but not so quickly. He called for the payments to be reinstated right away, describing a hit to Ohio — a state also won by Trump last November — for at least the “first two or three months.”  “Over time, this is going to have a dramatic impact,” Kasich said. “Who gets hurt? People. And it’s just outrageous.”  Nineteen Democratic state attorneys general have announced plans to sue Trump over the stoppage. Attorneys general from California, Kentucky, Massachusetts and New York were among those saying they will file the lawsuit in federal court in California to stop Trump’s attempt “to gut the health and well-being of our country.”  Collins appeared on ABC’s “This Week” and CNN’s “State of the Union,” Pelosi spoke on ABC, Graham appeared on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” and Kasich was on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”  ___  Follow Hope Yen on Twitter at https://twitter.com/hopeyen1",3.3,5,"[1.5, 5.0, 3.0, 2.5, 4.5]"
660,2060,10,16,2017,2017-10-16,Associated Press News,Trump voters in storm-ravaged county confront climate change," The church was empty, except for the piano too heavy for one man to move. It had been 21 days since the greatest storm Wayne Christopher had ever seen dumped a year’s worth of rain on his town, drowning this church where he was baptized, met his high school sweetheart and later married her.  He had piled the ruined pews out on the curb, next to water-logged hymnals and molding Sunday school lesson plans and chunks of drywall that used to be a mural of Noah’s Ark. Now he tilted his head up to take in the mountain of rubble, and Christopher, an evangelical Christian and a conservative Republican, considered what caused this destruction: that the violent act of nature had been made worse by acts of man.  “I think the Lord put us over the care of his creation, and when we pollute like we do, destroy the land, there’s consequences to that,” he said. “It might not catch up with us just right now, but it’s gonna catch up. Like a wound that needs to be healed.”  Jefferson County, Texas, is among the low-lying coastal areas of America that could lose the most as the ice caps melt and the seas warm and rise. At the same time, it is more economically dependent on the petroleum industry and its emissions-spewing refineries than any other place in the U.S. Residents seemed to choose between the two last November, abandoning a four-decade-old pattern of voting Democratic in presidential elections to support Donald Trump.  When the people of Jefferson County, Texas, narrowly voted majority Trump last November, climate change rarely came up as an issue. Then they were devastated by Hurricane Harvey. AP Video by Martha Irvine. (Oct. 16)  Then came Hurricane Harvey. Now some conservatives here are newly confronting some of the most polarizing questions in American political discourse: What role do humans play in global warming and the worsening of storms like Harvey? And what should they expect their leaders — including the climate-skeptic president they helped elect — to do about the problem now?  Answers are hard to come by in a place where refineries stand like cityscapes. Nearly 5,000 people work in the petroleum industry. Some have described the chemical stink in the air as “the smell of money” — it means paychecks, paid mortgages and meals.  Christopher, like most people in Jefferson County, believed that global warming was real before the storm hit. Post-Harvey, surrounded by debris stretching for block after block, he thinks the president’s outright rejection of the scientific consensus is no longer good enough.  But how do you help the climate without hurting those who depend on climate-polluting industries?  “It’s a Catch-22 kind of thing,” he said. “Do you want to build your economy, or do you want to save the world?”  ___  “Steroids for storms” is how Andrew Dessler explains the role global warming plays in extreme weather. Climate change didn’t create Hurricane Harvey or Irma or Maria. But Dessler, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University, and most scientists agree that warming and rising seas likely amplify storms that form naturally, feeding more water and more intensity as they plow toward land.  “It will be 60 inches of rain this time, maybe 80 inches next time,” Dessler said of Harvey’s record-setting rainfall for any single storm in U.S. history.  As a private citizen and candidate, Trump often referred to climate change as a hoax, and since taking office he and his administration have worked aggressively to undo policies designed to mitigate the damage. He announced his intention to pull out of the Paris climate agreement, a global accord of 195 nations to reduce carbon emissions, and his administration has dismantled environmental regulations and erased climate change data from government websites. This month, his Environmental Protection Agency administrator promised to kill an effort to limit carbon emissions from coal-fired plants.  Anthony Leiserowitz, a Yale University researcher, traces the politicization of the climate to 1997, when then-Democratic Vice President Al Gore brokered a commitment on the world stage to reduce greenhouse gases. The political parties have cleaved further apart ever since, and climate change denial reached a fever pitch as the Tea Party remade the GOP during President Barack Obama’s first term.  Americans tend to view the issue through their already established red-versus-blue lens, Leiserowitz said, but while there are fractions on each extreme, the majority still fall somewhere along a scale in the middle.  A new Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll finds that 63 percent of Americans think climate change is happening and that the government should address it, and that two-thirds of Americans disapprove of the way Trump is handling the issue. Most Americans also think weather disasters are getting more severe, and believe global warming is a factor.  As the downpour from Hurricane Harvey stretched into its second day, with no end in sight, Joe Evans watched from the window of his home in the Jefferson County seat of Beaumont, and an unexpected sense of guilt overcame him: “What have we been doing to the planet for all of these years?”  Evans, a Republican, once ran unsuccessfully for local office. He ignored climate change, as he thought Republicans were supposed to do, but Harvey’s deluge left him wondering why. When he was young, discussions of the ozone layer were uncontroversial; now they’re likely to end in pitched political debate.  “I think it’s one of those games that politicians play with us,” he said, “to once again make us choose a side.”  Evans voted for Trump, but he’s frustrated with what he describes as the “conservative echo chamber” that dismisses climate change instead of trying to find a way to apply conservative principles to simultaneously saving the Earth and the economy. Even today, some Republicans in the county complain about Gore and the hypocrisy they see in elite liberals who jet around the world, carbon emissions trailing behind them, to push climate policies on blue-collar workers trying to keep refinery jobs so they can feed their families.  Evans isn’t sure if the disastrous run of weather will cause climate change to become a bigger priority for residents here, or if as memories fade talk of this issue will, too.  “I haven’t put so much thought into it that I want to go mobilize a bunch of people and march on Washington,” he said. “But it made me think enough about it that I won’t actively take part in denying it. We can’t do that anymore.”  ___  Most in Texas didn’t believe climate change existed when Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University, began evangelizing about the issue years ago. Now studies estimate that 69 percent of Texans believe that the climate is changing, and 52 percent believe that has been caused by human activity. Most resistance she hears now is not with the science itself but over proposed solutions that mean government intrusion and regulation.  Jefferson County’s refineries produce 10 percent of the gasoline in the United States, 20 percent of diesel and half of the fuel used to fly commercial planes, said County Judge Jeff Branick, a Democrat who voted for Trump and then switched his party affiliation to Republican, in part because of his disagreement with the Democratic Party’s climate policies.  Branick doesn’t deny that climate change exists, but he calls himself a cheerleader for the petroleum industry and believes environmental policies are “job killers.”  John Sterman, a professor at MIT Sloan School of Management, said addressing climate change will invariably lead to gradual job losses in the fossil fuels industry. But communities have lost a dominant industry before, and those able to diversify can prosper. Jefferson County could look to the renewable energy industry, with jobs that require many of the skills refinery workers have, he said. Texas already produces more wind power than any other state.  Angela Lopez’s husband works in a refinery, so she understands the worry of the economic cost of addressing global warming. But her county is nicknamed “cancer alley” for its high levels of disease that residents have long attributed to living in the shadow of one of the largest concentrations of refineries in the world.  “It’s our livelihood, but it’s killing us,” Lopez said, standing in what used to be her dining room. Now her house in Beaumont is down to the studs. As Harvey’s floodwaters rose, she tried to save what she could. She piled the dresser drawers on the bed and perched the leather couch up on the coffee table. It did no good. The water didn’t stop until it reached the eaves, and the Lopezes lost everything they own.  Just about all of her relatives are conservatives, and indeed the political divides in the county run deep: Even as most of the communities along the Gulf Coast turned red years ago, Jefferson County clung to its Democratic roots. The county is ethnically diverse —41 percent white, 34 percent black and 20 percent Hispanic — with a historically strong union workforce. Trump won Jefferson by just 419 votes.  “To come up with real solutions, you have to be honest with yourself about what causes something to happen,” Lopez said. “It’s not just because some storm came, it was bad and unprecedented. It was unprecedented for a reason, so we have to acknowledge that and start working toward being better. And part of that conversation should be climate change.”  On a porch outside another ruined house nearby, two neighbors who both lost everything to Harvey started having that conversation.  Gene Jones, a truck driver who didn’t vote, asked Wilton Johnson, a Trump supporter, if he thought climate change intensified the storm.  “I don’t think so, no,” Johnson said.  “You don’t? You don’t think about the chemical plants and the hot weather? You don’t think that has anything to do with it?”  “I can understand people believing that,” Johnson replied. But he blames natural weather cycles for upending their lives so completely.  Jones now lives in a camper in his driveway; Johnson’s father has been sleeping in a recliner in his yard to ward off looters.  Johnson feels like he’s gone through the stages of grief. At first, as he fled his home, he denied how devastating the storm might be. Then he got angry, when he realized nothing could be saved — not the family photos or the 100-year-old Bible that fell apart in his hands. He grew depressed and now, finally, he thinks he’s come to accept this new reality as something that just happened because nature is not always kind, and never has been.  And he remains unshaken in his support for Trump’s environmental agenda.  “We need to be responsible human beings to the Earth, but at the same time we shouldn’t sacrifice the financial freedoms,” he said. “What good is a great environment if we’re poor and living like cavemen? And vice versa, I understand the other side of that: What’s great about living in luxury when you can’t go outside?  “I just don’t think we should look at two storms and say, ‘We’re ruining the Earth! Shut the plants down!’”  ___  When Wayne Christopher was a boy in Jefferson County, it got so hot he remembers frying eggs on the sidewalk. It has always been hot here, and there have always been hurricanes.  But it seems to him that something is different now. There is a palpable intensity in the air, in the haze that hangs over the interstate. The region has warmed about two degrees in his lifetime, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and annual rainfall has increased by about 7 inches on average. Christopher counts the number of times a beach road he’s driven on all his life has had to be rebuilt because the ocean overtook it.  “The sea keeps moving in — water rising, land disappearing or eroding or whatever you want to call it — it’s happening,” said Christopher, who is 66 now and retired after toiling more than 40 years for the railroad. “I think Mother Nature can come back, but there’s a point to where, if we just keep on and keep on, I don’t know if she can come back.”  He thinks the president he helped put in office should do something: take the threat seriously, research before he talks or tweets, not dismiss established science as a hoax because acknowledging it’s real would mean acknowledging that something must be done.  But like many others here, Christopher is not pushing to stick with the Paris climate agreement or other global coalitions because he’s not sure it’s fair that the United States should invest in clean energy when other countries that pollute might not. He worries that could cause more job losses to overseas factories, put a squeeze on the middle class and forfeit a slice of American sovereignty.  His wife, who also supported Trump, cocked her head as she thought about that sentiment.  “I can see the pros, I can see the cons,” Polly Christopher said. “But if you were to simplify it to your children, and they say, ‘Well, everybody else is doing it, if I do it what difference is it going to make?’ you would just get on them and say, ‘You’ve got to do the right thing. Right is right, and wrong’s wrong.’”  For weeks, the couple have been gutting Memorial Baptist Church, a place they consider their home. The congregation dwindled over time to about 45, mostly older people, and it was so hard to make ends meet the church canceled a $19,000-a-year flood insurance policy just two months before Harvey hit. Now it could cost some $1 million to rebuild, meaning the church may never be rebuilt at all.  So when Christopher’s granddaughter came by to help, found the piano in the otherwise empty sanctuary, sat down and started to play, he was overcome with a sense of grief.  “In my head I was thinking the whole time, this could be the last time that piano is played inside the auditorium,” he said.

The Justice Department is sending a federal hate crimes lawyer to Iowa to help prosecute a man charged with killing a transgender teenager last year. LGBT advocates have long been skeptical of Sessions' pledge to prosecute acts of violence against transgender people. But the move, outlined in recently filed court papers, is a sign he intends to do so. (AP Photo/Sait Serkan Gurbuz, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department has sent a federal hate crimes lawyer to Iowa to help prosecute a man charged with killing a transgender teenager last year, an unusual decision by Attorney General Jeff Sessions even as he takes other steps to erode the rights of transgender people broadly.  The case involves Jorge Sanders-Galvez, 23, who is charged with killing 16-year-old Kedarie Johnson in Burlington, Iowa, in March 2016. Authorities have not disclosed a motive, but Johnson’s relatives say he may have been targeted because he identified as both male and female.  The rare decision to involve a federal prosecutor in a local murder case, first reported Sunday by The New York Times, follows pledges by Sessions to aggressively prosecute acts of violence against transgender people. Those pledges have been met with skepticism from LGBT advocates, who point to his actions rolling back legal protections.  This month alone, Sessions said the Justice Department no longer considers transgender people shielded from workplace discrimination under federal law, and he issued sweeping guidance on protecting religious freedom that undercuts protections for LGBT people. During his first month in office, he rescinded an Obama administration directive advising schools to let transgender students use the bathroom of their choice.  As a Republican senator, Sessions opposed expanding the federal hate crimes statute to protect people based on their sexual orientation and gender identity. But as attorney general, he has promised to uphold that law and has made fighting hate crimes a priority.  “We are not going to allow persons in this country to be discriminated against or attacked in any way because of their sexual orientation,” Sessions said at a speech in June.  Reiterating that vow, Sessions said he had directed the Justice Department’s civil rights division to review some other cases in which transgender people were killed. Lawmakers in March urged him to give seven murders a closer look.  Johnson, a high school junior who was found fatally shot in an ally, was not among those cases.  Recently filed court documents show Christopher Perras of the Justice Department’s civil rights division will serve as a county prosecutor in the case. He has been involved in other hate crimes prosecutions, including that of an Iowa man convicted of stomping and kicking an African-American man in a racially targeted attack. He has also prosecuted several cases against law enforcement officers accused of civil rights violations.  LGBT advocates said it was right to involve a federal prosecutor in the case, but it shouldn’t be a “publicity stunt.”  “For Sessions now to seek credit for helping prosecute hate crimes against transgender people is akin to him handing out gasoline and matches and then looking for a pat on the back when he prosecutes someone for committing arson,” said Sharon McGowan, a former Justice Department official and strategy director for the LGBT-rights group Lambda Legal.",3.4411764705882355,17,"[5.0, 3.5, 5.0, 2.0, 5.0, 5.0, 3.5, 0.5, 2.5, 4.0, 4.0, 0.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 2.0]"
662,2062,10,15,2017,2017-10-15,Associated Press News,"Yellen sounds upbeat on economy, signaling likely rate hike"," Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen on Sunday sketched a bright outlook for the U.S. economy and for inflation prospects in coming months, saying the impact of the recent hurricanes will likely slow economic growth slightly but only temporarily and should be followed by a rebound by year’s end.  Her comments suggested that the central bank will soon resume raising interest rates to reflect the strengthening economy. Most economists foresee the next rate hike — the third this year — coming in December.  Speaking to an international banking seminar, Yellen acknowledged that the persistence of undesirably low inflation this year has been a surprise. But she said she expected inflation to start picking up as the effects of temporary factors, such as falling prices for consumer cellphone service, begin to fade.  “Economic activity in the United States has been growing moderately so far this year, and the labor market has continued to strengthen,” Yellen said in a speech to a panel that included central bank officials from China, Japan and the European Central Bank.  Of the hurricanes that struck Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, Yellen noted that they caused enormous damage. But she added:  “While the effects of the hurricanes on the U.S. economy are quite noticeable in the short term, history suggests that the longer-term effects will be modest and that aggregate economic activity will recover quickly.”  Yellen said that the economy’s growth, as measured by the gross domestic product, might have slowed slightly in the July-September quarter as a consequence of the hurricanes but that growth is likely rebounding in the current quarter.  The Fed chair’s speech Sunday followed the central bank’s decision at its meeting last month to leave its benchmark short-term rate unchanged in a range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent. At the same time, the Fed announced that it would begin parings its enormous portfolio of bonds, which it had amassed after the 2008 financial crisis in an effort to hold down long-term loan rates for consumers and businesses. The move to let its balance sheet gradually shrink could mean higher rates on mortgages and other loans over time.  During a question period, Yellen was asked whether a booming stock market that some see as overvalued or potentially higher budget deficits resulting from the Trump administration’s tax cut plan had increased economic uncertainty.  Yellen declined to respond specifically but noted that the Fed’s staff has described stock prices as elevated. At the same time, she said market levels should be viewed in the context of a banking system that she called “dramatically improved” since the 2008 financial crisis.  The Fed chair said the administration’s proposed tax cuts may have boosted consumer and business confidence but so far appear to have had little effect on investment or spending decisions. She said the Fed was taking a “wait and see attitude” on how the tax program might affect the economy given the many unknowns about what it might look like when the plan emerges from Congress.  In his presentation, Zhou Xiaochuan, head of China’s central bank, said that his country is trying to cut excess capacity in its steel and cement industries by 10 percent but that China requires a sizable output in those areas to support an infrastructure construction program. The Trump administration has been pushing China to reduce production in such areas as steel, saying its overcapacity has depressed global prices for steel and hurt American producers.  Haruhiko Kuroda, head of the Bank of Japan, said that his country’s economy was expanding moderately and that heightened global political risks so far haven’t destabilized financial markets. He did not say what risks he was referring to, but investors have been focusing on the standoff with North Korea over its increased missile tests and development of nuclear weapons.  The officials spoke before the Group of 30, an international body of bankers and academics. Gary Cohn, who leads President Donald Trump’s National Economic Council, spoke on a separate panel about the administration’s efforts to scale back some of the tighter rules imposed on the U.S. financial sector after the 2008 crisis. In particular, he reiterated that the administration supported easing restrictions on smaller banks.  Yellen’s appearance Sunday came as her future at the central bank is in doubt, with her four-year term as chair ending in February. Trump has been considering several candidates for the post, in addition to the possibility of offering Yellen a second term. The other candidates include Jerome Powell, a member of the Fed’s board; Kevin Warsh, a former member of the board; John Taylor, a Stanford University economist; and Cohn.

The Las Vegas tourism sector is bracing for changes in the aftermath of the massacre that killed 58 people at an outdoor music festival. (AP Photo/John Locher)  LAS VEGAS (AP) — Las Vegas’ tourism sector is bracing for changes in the aftermath of the massacre that killed 58 people at an outdoor music festival.  Analysts who closely track the finances of the city’s casino companies say Las Vegas will see a short-term dip in visitors in response to the shooting.  Casinos and police may have to impose new security measures after gunman Stephen Paddock brought more than 20 rifles into his hotel room and drove a car filled with explosives into the parking garage.  The “What Happens in Vegas Stays in Vegas” slogan has been put on hold, as has one unveiled in the weeks before the shooting by the owner of Mandalay Bay that said, “We are not in the hotel business ... we are in the holy s--- business.”  Electronic billboards that typically promote restaurants, concerts, a topless pool and other entertainment are now showing a dedicated phone line for victims and their families, along with words of appreciation for first responders and casino employees.  “We’ve been there for you during the good times. Thank you for being there for us now,” reads a black-and-white billboard message with the city skyline and ”#VegasStrong.”  It’s hard to quantify the effect the shooting will have on Las Vegas tourism. Airplanes still carry loads of tourists to the desert oasis, convention-goers fill large halls to discuss the latest industry trends, and slot machines ring in the casinos.  But stock prices of the main Las Vegas casino companies all took a minor tumble after the shooting, in an indication the attack will have some effect on the industry. Analysts with investment bank Morgan Stanley forecast the shooting will decrease demand for the Las Vegas market for about six months and have a 4 percent to 6 percent economic effect.  The analysts looked into the effect of terrorist attacks on “revenue per available room,” a key gauge of a lodging company’s performance, across different markets to measure the shooting’s potential impact. The report said not all markets are alike, but the effects on tourism of events such as the Orlando, Florida, nightclub attack have gradually become less pronounced and shorter.  On Oct. 1, Paddock, a 64-year-old professional video poker player, shattered windows of his hotel suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel casino and unleashed withering gunfire at the Route 91 Harvest country music festival below before killing himself. His vehicle was found at the hotel’s massive parking garage with a potentially deadly cargo of 1,600 rounds of ammunition and 90 pounds of chemical explosives.  In the days after the shooting, visitors found marked police SUVs parked outside their hotels along the Strip. Security employees of the Wynn Las Vegas and Encore casino-resorts used hand-held metal detectors to check bags. Guards asked some visitors to pop their trunks.  But those measures have since been scaled back. A tour of several major resorts found no apparent new security measures other than guards checking room keys at Mandalay Bay.  Mandalay Bay’s parent company, MGM Resorts International, owns more than a dozen properties, including casinos, convention space and arenas on the Las Vegas Strip. Spokeswoman Debra DeShong said in a statement the company has elevated its level of security, but she declined to provide details.  Las Vegas hotel operators must make their guests feel valued and comfortable in the aftermath of the shooting, said Michael McCall, Michigan State University professor of hospitality business. He suggested resorts offer room upgrades or discounted tickets to customers as tokens of appreciation.  But he said many casinos and hotels will tread lightly when it comes to airport-style security in a city where people want to let loose.  “You don’t want it to become a sort of ground zero military-type of operation,” McCall said. “People are going there largely for fun.”  MGM declined to comment on any hotel room or convention cancellations. Caesars said its properties haven’t received out-of-norm room cancellations, and no conventions were called off.  Last week, the National Business Aviation Association convention drew around 27,000 people to Las Vegas. IMEX America, an expo for incentive travel, meetings and events, brought 12,000 attendees.  Luis Barros visited Las Vegas for the aviation conference. While sitting at an airport slot machine, he said he never considered canceling his trip after the shooting and had no concerns about his safety.  “I figured this is probably going to be one of the safest places after what just happened,” the Dallas resident said. “I think I’m more concerned about the somber feeling, but as far as security-wise, no, not at all.”  The shooting has altered at least one event. Organizers of the GEICO Rock ‘n’ Roll Marathon scheduled for November will no longer start the annual race outside Mandalay Bay or hold the pre-race concert at the venue where the shooting took place.  Las Vegas last year welcomed 42.9 million visitors and hosted almost 22,000 conventions. On average, 95 percent of the 149,339 rooms available were booked during weekends. Clark County recorded gambling revenue of $9.7 billion.  For the time being, the fierce competition for those dollars is not on display.  “There’s going to be a time when we go back to promoting Las Vegas as the greatest destination in the world, but that’s not now,” said the city’s top tourism official, Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority CEO Rossi Ralenkotter. “We need to take care of this, we need to take care of our customers, we need to take care of the community itself, and that’s what we will be doing.”  ___  For complete coverage of the Las Vegas shooting, click here: https://apnews.com/tag/LasVegasmassshooting.",3.479591836734694,98,"[2.0, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 3.0, 2.5, 4.0, 1.5, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.0, 2.5, 4.0, 3.5, 2.5, 5.0, 3.5, 2.5, 2.5, 4.5, 0.5, 4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 4.5, 4.5, 3.0, 2.5, 2.5, 4.0, 1.5, 2.5, 4.0, 5.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 3.0, 4.0, 2.5, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 2.5, 2.0, 3.5, 0.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 5.0, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 2.0, 2.5, 4.0, 2.0, 3.5, 4.5, 2.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 2.5, 5.0]"

Sandven explains to The Associated Press how investors’ views of the market have evolved and doubled back in the 11 months since the 2016 election. (Courtesy of U.S. Bank Wealth Management via AP)  NEW YORK (AP) — On the surface, the stock market may not have looked any different in September than it did earlier in the year. But even though indexes continued to climb, the market went through a shift.  Starting in late August, banks and industrial companies rose and the dollar got stronger. The Russell 2000 index has climbed 11 percent from mid-August as smaller, U.S.-focused companies made big gains. That’s a change from the way stocks have behaved for much of this year: technology companies and other corporations that do a lot of their business overseas had been soaring as the dollar weakened, and low interest rates have hampered financial company stocks. But if the September pattern sounds familiar, it should: it’s the same trend that dominated the market from the November presidential election through President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January.  Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist for U.S. Bank Wealth Management, explains how investors’ views of the market have evolved and doubled back in the 11th months since the election. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.  Q: Why has the market changed direction in the last few weeks?  A: Tax reform seems to be gaining steam, and that’s boosted sentiment as well as expectations for President Trump’s pro-growth agenda. With tax reform you’re likely to see earnings favorably impacted, and a pro-growth agenda tends to be favorable for small caps as well. So the Russell 2000 has been on a tear. Tax reform tends to be U.S.-centric and is likely to boost earnings, which obviously is favorable for the broad market. Secondly, should a tax reform come to pass and result in an elevated dollar, that could conversely put some pressure on earnings for multinational companies.  Q: So in a lot of ways, stocks are making the same moves they made about a year ago. How is this move different from that one?  A: Following the November election (investors anticipated) a pro-growth agenda, expectations for inflation, deregulation and tax cuts. The pro-growth agenda now is gaining some steam again. The key difference between now and then is we have greater visibility on earnings. Earnings for the S&P 500 are tracking for about a 10 percent increase year over year and in 2018 we’re seeing that same kind of growth. The whole global economy is improving, which means higher earnings and higher earnings mean higher stock prices. We still don’t see a looming recession or ramping inflation. Stocks still provide an opportunity for investors to get yield as well.  Clearly the equity market valuations are elevated, but we think there is valuation support in an environment where inflation is low. But while our outlook remains constructive, clearly risks remain. You do have a flattening yield curve, there’s political wrangling and low expectations on balance and you’ve got geopolitical tensions.  Q: Are there other reasons for those gains, like improvement in the economy?  A: There’s still much to like about the U.S. equity market. Earnings are increasing and generally restrained inflation and low interest rates provide support. The large caps are somewhat in pause mode ahead of third-quarter (earnings) reports. We’re seeing consensus expectations for about a 5-percent increase in earnings year over year and higher earnings still warrant higher stock prices. We like the macroeconomic and fundamentals backdrops.  Q: Have you advised investors to make any changes in response to this market shift?  A: Our message has been the same, really. That is that we like equities over fixed-income securities and we like U.S. stocks over international even though international growth is improving. Nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are in positive territory year to date, (which) implies a market that’s likely to trend higher. Technology and select areas of consumer discretionary and health care remain favorites.  Our year-end price target for the S&P 500 is 2,550, at the midpoint of a range between 2,500 and 2,600. Should tax reform visibility improve and earnings get reported as we expect they will, our sense is that we’ll end the year toward the high side of that range.

The thinning of forests in central Oregon has saved homes amid one of the most devastating wildfire seasons in the American West. (Alexandra Steinmetz/Deschutes Collaborative Forest Project via AP)  SISTERS, Ore. (AP) — Lightning started a forest fire one August afternoon near this Oregon tourist town, and it was spreading fast. Residents in outlying areas evacuated as flames marched toward their homes.  Just a few months earlier, the U.S. Forest Service and a group of locals representing environmental, logging and recreational interests arranged to thin part of the overgrown forest, creating a buffer zone around Sisters.  Workers removed trees and brush with machines, then came through on foot to ignite prescribed burns. That effort saved homes, and perhaps the community of 2,500 on the eastern slopes of the Cascade Range, by slowing the fire’s progress and allowing firefighters to corral it.  Scrutiny of the condition of the American West’s forests, and of policies that curtailed logging and suppressed wildfires, has intensified amid a devastating wildfire season that has burned a combined area bigger than Maryland and caused widespread destruction in California’s wine country.  Until the advent of aggressive fire suppression at the turn of the last century, forests were historically shaped by low-intensity blazes, with the flames clearing underbrush but not killing tall trees. Forests across the West are now so overgrown they’ve been called powder kegs.  Is there a better way to protect against devastating wildfires? A look at one project that saved homes: https://t.co/bDwsY3b7yC pic.twitter.com/j2o5IN2k6C — AP West Region (@APWestRegion) October 16, 2017  The work by the Deschutes Collaborative Forest Project in central Oregon, where towns and subdivisions sit in a green ocean of Ponderosa and lodgepole pines, shows the potential of forest thinning. And it shows how loggers and environmentalists - normally bitter enemies - can join forces.  But it also highlights the challenges of replicating the forest thinning across the West, where a lack of timber workers and money are among the obstacles.  On a recent morning, Forest Service fire manager James Osborne drove into a section of the Deschutes National Forest outside Sisters that was thinned in May. Widely spaced Ponderosas were blackened to twice the height of a person. But higher up, the bark retained its normal orangey color. Needle clusters shone vibrant green in the sunshine. Four deer trotted through dappled sunlight. This part of the forest looked healthy, not despite of, but due to, the prescribed burn.  “Ponderosa pines are used to low-intensity fires,” Osborne said. “Every five to 15 years, a fire would come through. We’re trying to take it back to low-intensity fires.”  California’s situation is different because its wildfires have generally ignited in chaparral - brush that naturally grows densely packed, said Andrew Latimer, plant expert at the University of California-Davis. The temperate coniferous forests that burn in large wildfires elsewhere are historically less dense.  Returning those forests to their natural state is the goal of groups like the Deschutes Collaborative, one of 23 projects in the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration program created in 2009 by Congress. Overcoming suspicions and stereotypes was one of the Oregon group’s first hurdles.  Deschutes Collaborative member Marilyn Miller, an environmentalist, and former member Chuck Burley, who then worked for an Oregon sawmill, used to call each other names, Miller recalled during a recent tour of Deschutes Collaborative projects. But they got to know each other in Bend, home to more microbreweries per capita than anywhere else in America.  “I hate to say this, but beer really is a good conversation starter,” Miller said. “We would sit and talk. We learned we’re real humans with real concerns, and what we care about isn’t that far apart.”  Burley, who’s now employed with the Forest Service, said the Deschutes Collaborative made recommendations on where and how much to thin, and the Forest Service almost always adopted them.  “They had a consensus, a starting point,” Burley said in a phone interview.  Oregon Gov. Kate Brown, a Democrat, applauds collaborative efforts, including the Good Neighbor Authority under which states can organize restoration of federal lands. Under the programs, a mill removes the timber after agreeing to buy it at a certain rate. The proceeds stay local, helping finance more restoration.  “No. 1, it allows us to put Oregonians back to work in the woods, so there are good jobs,” Brown said. “No. 2, it provides product for the local milling infrastructure. And No. 3, it creates healthier forests. Do I think we need more efforts like this? Absolutely.”  Such groups understand some management is required to keep public lands healthy, said Amy Tinderholt, a Deschutes National Forest ranger.  But replicating the work across the sprawling reaches of the West poses several challenges.  “We really don’t have the capacity in most places to do the work at anything like the scale needed,” said John Bailey, an Oregon State University professor of silviculture and fire management.  There are no longer enough timber outlets such as mills and plants, he said. And things like equipment, trucks, drivers and infrastructure will take time and resources to ramp back up.  Also, smoke from controlled burns can surpass legal limits, though it’s much less than smoke from out-of-control wildfires. Some wilderness areas and habitats for endangered species could be off-limits.  Another challenge is money.  “All of those funds will take you only so far across the landscape, and we’ve got pretty large landscapes,” Tinderholt said.  Restored areas also would have to be thinned again after some years, unless fires are allowed to burn the vegetation that grows back.  In Oregon, many locals are proud of the Deschutes Collaborative’s work, and want to see more done in the state and other parts of the West.  “As it unfolded, the community has really come behind it. It’s amazing,” said Kevin Larkin, a senior Deschutes Forest ranger. “Scaling up, that’s our hope.”  ___  Follow Andrew Selsky on Twitter at https://twitter.com/andrewselsky",3.357142857142857,7,"[0.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0]"
690,2095,10,16,2017,2017-10-16,Associated Press News,"Scientists witness huge cosmic crash, find origins of gold","This illustration provided by the Carnegie Institution for Science depicts the collision of two neutron stars detected on Aug. 17, 2017. The explosion threw matter, light, radiation and gravitational waves into space. The discovery was reported on Monday, Oct. 16, 2017. (Robin Dienel/Carnegie Institution for Science via AP)  WASHINGTON (AP) — It was a faint signal, but it told of one of the most violent acts in the universe, and it would soon reveal secrets of the cosmos, including how gold was created.  Astronomers around the world reacted to the signal quickly, focusing telescopes located on every continent and even in orbit to a distant spot in the sky.  What they witnessed in mid-August and revealed Monday was the long-ago collision of two neutron stars — a phenomenon California Institute of Technology’s David H. Reitze called “the most spectacular fireworks in the universe.”  “When these things collide, all hell breaks loose,” he said.  Measurements of the light and other energy emanating from the crash have helped scientists explain how planet-killing gamma ray bursts are born, how fast the universe is expanding, and where heavy elements like platinum and gold come from.  “This is getting everything you wish for,” said Syracuse University physics professor Duncan Brown, one of more than 4,000 scientists involved in the blitz of science that the crash kicked off. “This is our fantasy observation.”  It started in a galaxy called NGC 4993, seen from Earth in the Hydra constellation. Two neutron stars, collapsed cores of stars so dense that a teaspoon of their matter would weigh 1 billion tons, danced ever faster and closer together until they collided, said Carnegie Institution astronomer Maria Drout.  The crash, called a kilonova, generated a fierce burst of gamma rays and a gravitational wave, a faint ripple in the fabric of space and time, first theorized by Albert Einstein.  “This is like a cosmic atom smasher at a scale far beyond humans would be capable of building,” said Andy Howell, a staff scientist at the Las Cumbres Observatory. “We finally now know what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object and it’s a kilonova.”  The crash happened 130 million years ago, while dinosaurs still roamed on Earth, but the signal didn’t arrive on Earth until Aug. 17 after traveling 130 million light-years. A light-year is 5.88 trillion miles.  Signals were picked up within 1.7 seconds of each other, by NASA’s Fermi telescope, which detects gamma rays, and gravity wave detectors in Louisiana and Washington state that are a part of the LIGO Laboratory , whose founders won a Nobel Prize earlier this month. A worldwide alert went out to focus telescopes on what became the most well-observed astronomical event in history.  Before August, the only other gravity waves detected by LIGO were generated by colliding black holes. But black holes let no light escape, so astronomers could see nothing.  This time there was plenty to see, measure and analyze: matter, light, and other radiation. The Hubble Space Telescope even got a snapshot of the afterglow.  Finding where the crash happened wasn’t easy. Eventually scientists narrowed the location down to 100 galaxies, began a closer search of those, and found it in the ninth galaxy they looked at.  It is like “the classic challenge of finding a needle in the haystack with the added challenge that the needle is fading away and the haystack is moving,” said Marcelle Soares-Santos, an astrophysicist at Brandeis University.  “The completeness of this picture from the beginning to the end is unprecedented,” said Columbia University physics professor Szabolcs Marka. “There are many, many extraordinary discoveries within the discovery.”  The colliding stars spewed bright blue, super-hot debris that was dense and unstable. Some of it coalesced into heavy elements, like gold, platinum and uranium. Scientists had suspected neutron star collisions had enough power to create heavier elements, but weren’t certain until they witnessed it.  “We see the gold being formed,” said Syracuse’s Brown.  Calculations from a telescope measuring ultraviolet light showed that the combined mass of the heavy elements from this explosion is 1,300 times the mass of Earth. And all that stuff — including lighter elements — was thrown out in all different directions and is now speeding across the universe.  Perhaps one day the material will clump together into planets the way ours was formed, Reitze said — maybe ones with rich veins of precious metals.  “We already knew that iron came from a stellar explosion, the calcium in your bones came from stars and now we know the gold in your wedding ring came from merging neutron stars,” said University of California Santa Cruz’s Ryan Foley.  The crash also helped explain the origins of one of the most dangerous forces of the cosmos — short gamma ray bursts, focused beams of radiation that could erase life on any planet that happened to get in the way. These bursts shoot out in two different directions perpendicular to where the two neutron stars first crash, Reitze said.  Luckily for us, the beams of gamma rays were not focused on Earth and were generated too far away to be a threat, he said.  Scientists knew that the universe has been expanding since the Big Bang. By using LIGO to measure gravitational waves while watching this event unfold, researchers came up with a new estimate for how fast that is happening, the so-called Hubble Constant. Before this, scientists came up with two slightly different answers using different techniques. The rough figure that came out of this event is between the original two, Reitze said.  The first optical images showed a bright blue dot that was very hot, which was likely the start of the heavy element creation process amid the neutron star debris, Drout said. After a day or two that blue faded, becoming much fainter and redder. And after three weeks it was completely gone, she said.  This almost didn’t happen. Eight days after the signal came through, the LIGO gravitational waves were shut down for a year’s worth of planned upgrades. A month later the whole area where the crash happened would have been blocked from astronomers’ prying eyes by the sun.  Scientists involved with the search for gravitational waves said this was the event they had prepared for over more than 20 years.  The findings are “of spectacular importance,” said Penn State physicist Abhay Ashtekar, who wasn’t part of the research. “This is really brand new.”  Almost all of the discoveries confirmed existing theories, but had not been proven — an encouraging result for theorists who have been trying to explain what is happening in the cosmos, said France Cordova, an astrophysicist who directs the National Science Foundation.  “We so far have been unable to prove Einstein wrong,” said Georgia Tech physics professor Laura Cadonati. “But we’re going to keep trying.”  ___  Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears .

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)  WASHINGTON (AP) — When two extremely dense neutron stars crashed together in a distant galaxy, astronomers struck scientific gold, confirming previously unproven theories, including some from Albert Einstein.  Scientists announced Monday that after picking up two faint signals in mid-August, they were able to find the location of the long-ago crash and see the end of it play out. Measurements of the light and other energy that the crash produced helped them answer some cosmic questions.  GRAVITATIONAL WAVES  Scientists, starting with Einstein, figured that when two neutron stars collide they would produce a gravitational wave, a ripple in the universe-wide fabric of space-time. Four other times that these waves were detected they were the result of merging black holes. This is the first time scientists observed one caused by a neutron star crash.  WHERE GOLD COMES FROM  The Big Bang created light elements like hydrogen and helium. Supernovas created medium elements, up to iron. But what about the heavier ones like gold, platinum and uranium? Astronomers thought they came from two neutron stars colliding, and when they saw this crash they confirmed it. One astronomer described as a “giant train wreck that creates gold.” They estimate that this one event generated an amount of gold and platinum that outweighs the entire Earth by a factor of 10.  GAMMA RAYS  Gamma ray bursts are some of the most energetic and deadly pulses of radiation in the universe. Astronomers weren’t quite sure where short gamma ray bursts came from, but figured that a crash of neutron stars was a good bet. Watching this event confirmed the theory.  EXPANDING UNIVERSE  Astronomers know the universe is expanding, and they use a figure called the Hubble Constant to describe how fast. Two different ways scientists have of measuring this speed of expansion yields two numbers that are somewhat close to each other, but not quite the same. By measuring how far the gravitational wave had to travel, astronomers came up with another estimate that was between the earlier two, but it also comes with a large margin of error.  HOW FAST DO RAYS AND WAVES GO?  The crash showed that gravitational waves and gamma rays travel at nearly the speed of light — which is what Einstein’s General Relativity theory says.

692,2098,10,16,2017,2017-10-16,Associated Press News,Trump voters in storm-ravaged county confront climate change," The church was empty, except for the piano too heavy for one man to move. It had been 21 days since the greatest storm Wayne Christopher had ever seen dumped a year’s worth of rain on his town, drowning this church where he was baptized, met his high school sweetheart and later married her.  He had piled the ruined pews out on the curb, next to water-logged hymnals and molding Sunday school lesson plans and chunks of drywall that used to be a mural of Noah’s Ark. Now he tilted his head up to take in the mountain of rubble, and Christopher, an evangelical Christian and a conservative Republican, considered what caused this destruction: that the violent act of nature had been made worse by acts of man.  “I think the Lord put us over the care of his creation, and when we pollute like we do, destroy the land, there’s consequences to that,” he said. “It might not catch up with us just right now, but it’s gonna catch up. Like a wound that needs to be healed.”  Jefferson County, Texas, is among the low-lying coastal areas of America that could lose the most as the ice caps melt and the seas warm and rise. At the same time, it is more economically dependent on the petroleum industry and its emissions-spewing refineries than any other place in the U.S. Residents seemed to choose between the two last November, abandoning a four-decade-old pattern of voting Democratic in presidential elections to support Donald Trump.  When the people of Jefferson County, Texas, narrowly voted majority Trump last November, climate change rarely came up as an issue. Then they were devastated by Hurricane Harvey. AP Video by Martha Irvine. (Oct. 16)  Then came Hurricane Harvey. Now some conservatives here are newly confronting some of the most polarizing questions in American political discourse: What role do humans play in global warming and the worsening of storms like Harvey? And what should they expect their leaders — including the climate-skeptic president they helped elect — to do about the problem now?  Answers are hard to come by in a place where refineries stand like cityscapes. Nearly 5,000 people work in the petroleum industry. Some have described the chemical stink in the air as “the smell of money” — it means paychecks, paid mortgages and meals.  Christopher, like most people in Jefferson County, believed that global warming was real before the storm hit. Post-Harvey, surrounded by debris stretching for block after block, he thinks the president’s outright rejection of the scientific consensus is no longer good enough.  But how do you help the climate without hurting those who depend on climate-polluting industries?  “It’s a Catch-22 kind of thing,” he said. “Do you want to build your economy, or do you want to save the world?”  ___  “Steroids for storms” is how Andrew Dessler explains the role global warming plays in extreme weather. Climate change didn’t create Hurricane Harvey or Irma or Maria. But Dessler, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University, and most scientists agree that warming and rising seas likely amplify storms that form naturally, feeding more water and more intensity as they plow toward land.  “It will be 60 inches of rain this time, maybe 80 inches next time,” Dessler said of Harvey’s record-setting rainfall for any single storm in U.S. history.  As a private citizen and candidate, Trump often referred to climate change as a hoax, and since taking office he and his administration have worked aggressively to undo policies designed to mitigate the damage. He announced his intention to pull out of the Paris climate agreement, a global accord of 195 nations to reduce carbon emissions, and his administration has dismantled environmental regulations and erased climate change data from government websites. This month, his Environmental Protection Agency administrator promised to kill an effort to limit carbon emissions from coal-fired plants.  Anthony Leiserowitz, a Yale University researcher, traces the politicization of the climate to 1997, when then-Democratic Vice President Al Gore brokered a commitment on the world stage to reduce greenhouse gases. The political parties have cleaved further apart ever since, and climate change denial reached a fever pitch as the Tea Party remade the GOP during President Barack Obama’s first term.  Americans tend to view the issue through their already established red-versus-blue lens, Leiserowitz said, but while there are fractions on each extreme, the majority still fall somewhere along a scale in the middle.  A new Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll finds that 63 percent of Americans think climate change is happening and that the government should address it, and that two-thirds of Americans disapprove of the way Trump is handling the issue. Most Americans also think weather disasters are getting more severe, and believe global warming is a factor.  As the downpour from Hurricane Harvey stretched into its second day, with no end in sight, Joe Evans watched from the window of his home in the Jefferson County seat of Beaumont, and an unexpected sense of guilt overcame him: “What have we been doing to the planet for all of these years?”  Evans, a Republican, once ran unsuccessfully for local office. He ignored climate change, as he thought Republicans were supposed to do, but Harvey’s deluge left him wondering why. When he was young, discussions of the ozone layer were uncontroversial; now they’re likely to end in pitched political debate.  “I think it’s one of those games that politicians play with us,” he said, “to once again make us choose a side.”  Evans voted for Trump, but he’s frustrated with what he describes as the “conservative echo chamber” that dismisses climate change instead of trying to find a way to apply conservative principles to simultaneously saving the Earth and the economy. Even today, some Republicans in the county complain about Gore and the hypocrisy they see in elite liberals who jet around the world, carbon emissions trailing behind them, to push climate policies on blue-collar workers trying to keep refinery jobs so they can feed their families.  Evans isn’t sure if the disastrous run of weather will cause climate change to become a bigger priority for residents here, or if as memories fade talk of this issue will, too.  “I haven’t put so much thought into it that I want to go mobilize a bunch of people and march on Washington,” he said. “But it made me think enough about it that I won’t actively take part in denying it. We can’t do that anymore.”  ___  Most in Texas didn’t believe climate change existed when Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University, began evangelizing about the issue years ago. Now studies estimate that 69 percent of Texans believe that the climate is changing, and 52 percent believe that has been caused by human activity. Most resistance she hears now is not with the science itself but over proposed solutions that mean government intrusion and regulation.  Jefferson County’s refineries produce 10 percent of the gasoline in the United States, 20 percent of diesel and half of the fuel used to fly commercial planes, said County Judge Jeff Branick, a Democrat who voted for Trump and then switched his party affiliation to Republican, in part because of his disagreement with the Democratic Party’s climate policies.  Branick doesn’t deny that climate change exists, but he calls himself a cheerleader for the petroleum industry and believes environmental policies are “job killers.”  John Sterman, a professor at MIT Sloan School of Management, said addressing climate change will invariably lead to gradual job losses in the fossil fuels industry. But communities have lost a dominant industry before, and those able to diversify can prosper. Jefferson County could look to the renewable energy industry, with jobs that require many of the skills refinery workers have, he said. Texas already produces more wind power than any other state.  Angela Lopez’s husband works in a refinery, so she understands the worry of the economic cost of addressing global warming. But her county is nicknamed “cancer alley” for its high levels of disease that residents have long attributed to living in the shadow of one of the largest concentrations of refineries in the world.  “It’s our livelihood, but it’s killing us,” Lopez said, standing in what used to be her dining room. Now her house in Beaumont is down to the studs. As Harvey’s floodwaters rose, she tried to save what she could. She piled the dresser drawers on the bed and perched the leather couch up on the coffee table. It did no good. The water didn’t stop until it reached the eaves, and the Lopezes lost everything they own.  Just about all of her relatives are conservatives, and indeed the political divides in the county run deep: Even as most of the communities along the Gulf Coast turned red years ago, Jefferson County clung to its Democratic roots. The county is ethnically diverse —41 percent white, 34 percent black and 20 percent Hispanic — with a historically strong union workforce. Trump won Jefferson by just 419 votes.  “To come up with real solutions, you have to be honest with yourself about what causes something to happen,” Lopez said. “It’s not just because some storm came, it was bad and unprecedented. It was unprecedented for a reason, so we have to acknowledge that and start working toward being better. And part of that conversation should be climate change.”  On a porch outside another ruined house nearby, two neighbors who both lost everything to Harvey started having that conversation.  Gene Jones, a truck driver who didn’t vote, asked Wilton Johnson, a Trump supporter, if he thought climate change intensified the storm.  “I don’t think so, no,” Johnson said.  “You don’t? You don’t think about the chemical plants and the hot weather? You don’t think that has anything to do with it?”  “I can understand people believing that,” Johnson replied. But he blames natural weather cycles for upending their lives so completely.  Jones now lives in a camper in his driveway; Johnson’s father has been sleeping in a recliner in his yard to ward off looters.  Johnson feels like he’s gone through the stages of grief. At first, as he fled his home, he denied how devastating the storm might be. Then he got angry, when he realized nothing could be saved — not the family photos or the 100-year-old Bible that fell apart in his hands. He grew depressed and now, finally, he thinks he’s come to accept this new reality as something that just happened because nature is not always kind, and never has been.  And he remains unshaken in his support for Trump’s environmental agenda.  “We need to be responsible human beings to the Earth, but at the same time we shouldn’t sacrifice the financial freedoms,” he said. “What good is a great environment if we’re poor and living like cavemen? And vice versa, I understand the other side of that: What’s great about living in luxury when you can’t go outside?  “I just don’t think we should look at two storms and say, ‘We’re ruining the Earth! Shut the plants down!’”  ___  When Wayne Christopher was a boy in Jefferson County, it got so hot he remembers frying eggs on the sidewalk. It has always been hot here, and there have always been hurricanes.  But it seems to him that something is different now. There is a palpable intensity in the air, in the haze that hangs over the interstate. The region has warmed about two degrees in his lifetime, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and annual rainfall has increased by about 7 inches on average. Christopher counts the number of times a beach road he’s driven on all his life has had to be rebuilt because the ocean overtook it.  “The sea keeps moving in — water rising, land disappearing or eroding or whatever you want to call it — it’s happening,” said Christopher, who is 66 now and retired after toiling more than 40 years for the railroad. “I think Mother Nature can come back, but there’s a point to where, if we just keep on and keep on, I don’t know if she can come back.”  He thinks the president he helped put in office should do something: take the threat seriously, research before he talks or tweets, not dismiss established science as a hoax because acknowledging it’s real would mean acknowledging that something must be done.  But like many others here, Christopher is not pushing to stick with the Paris climate agreement or other global coalitions because he’s not sure it’s fair that the United States should invest in clean energy when other countries that pollute might not. He worries that could cause more job losses to overseas factories, put a squeeze on the middle class and forfeit a slice of American sovereignty.  His wife, who also supported Trump, cocked her head as she thought about that sentiment.  “I can see the pros, I can see the cons,” Polly Christopher said. “But if you were to simplify it to your children, and they say, ‘Well, everybody else is doing it, if I do it what difference is it going to make?’ you would just get on them and say, ‘You’ve got to do the right thing. Right is right, and wrong’s wrong.’”  For weeks, the couple have been gutting Memorial Baptist Church, a place they consider their home. The congregation dwindled over time to about 45, mostly older people, and it was so hard to make ends meet the church canceled a $19,000-a-year flood insurance policy just two months before Harvey hit. Now it could cost some $1 million to rebuild, meaning the church may never be rebuilt at all.  So when Christopher’s granddaughter came by to help, found the piano in the otherwise empty sanctuary, sat down and started to play, he was overcome with a sense of grief.  “In my head I was thinking the whole time, this could be the last time that piano is played inside the auditorium,” he said. Then she started to sing: “Amazing grace, how sweet the sound ...”  “It did something to me,” he said.  Both he and his wife believe President Trump has a responsibility to look at the destruction Harvey left them with and act accordingly.  “He’s got a business mind. Whatever it takes to make money, that’s what he’s going to do to make America great again,” Christopher said, and that’s why he voted for Trump. “But it does make me wonder if he looks at global warming as a real harm. Because you can make all the money in the world here. But if you don’t have a world, what good is it going to do you?”  __  Science writer Seth Borenstein, multimedia journalist Martha Irvine and data journalist Angeliki Kastanis contributed to this report.  __  Read more in the AP’s Trump Country series here .",3.5526315789473686,19,"[3.5, 2.5, 5.0, 1.5, 4.5, 4.5, 3.0, 4.5, 5.0, 3.5, 0.5, 3.0, 0.5, 4.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 5.0]"

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)  GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) — President Donald Trump waded back into Southern politics Monday, showering praise on one of his earliest supporters, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster.  At a closed-door campaign fundraiser, Trump praised McMaster as his “friend” and “compatriot” and predicted McMaster would be the state’s governor for “many years,” according to video of the event posted by the South Carolina newspaper The State.  “He’s a terrific person, terrific man. He works so hard,” Trump told the crowd. “He loves South Carolina, he loves the people.”  Trump’s appearance at a private fundraiser for McMaster in Greenville came less than a month after the defeat of Sen. Luther Strange, the president’s preferred candidate in a Republican runoff for a U.S. Senate seat from Alabama.  McMaster greeted Trump at the airport in nearby Greer, South Carolina, before they traveled to an Embassy Suites hotel for the event. Two of the state’s Republican lawmakers in Washington, Sen. Lindsey Graham and Rep. Joe Wilson, flew with Trump on Air Force One.  Organizers closed the event to the news media, but several minutes of video were posted online by The State.  Some in heavily Republican South Carolina see similarities between McMaster and Strange, both with impeccable Republican credentials.  Strange fought same-sex marriage as Alabama attorney general. McMaster headed South Carolina’s GOP for years, was its top prosecutor and was elected lieutenant governor in 2014. Both men were elevated to their current offices by appointment. Strange was appointed by then-Gov. Robert Bentley to fill the seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. McMaster was elevated to the governor’s office after Trump picked then-Gov. Nikki Haley to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.  Strange and McMaster took political risks to support Trump’s presidential candidacy. Known for rewarding loyalty, Trump backed their candidacies.  But Strange lost the nomination to Moore, who was twice removed as Alabama Supreme Court chief justice. The first removal was for defying a federal judge’s order to take down a Ten Commandments monument from the state judicial building. He was elected again but was permanently suspended after a judicial discipline panel ruled he urged probate judges to deny marriage licenses to gay couples. Moore was propelled by his support across the mostly white, evangelical-dominated state where voters have repeatedly embraced political outsiders who campaign heavily on defending their religious values and rebuffing the establishment.  Although he is the incumbent, McMaster isn’t receiving political deference: several Republicans are challenging him in the primary. His most formidable opponent thus far is Catherine Templeton, an anti-union attorney who served Haley as head of the state’s labor and public health departments.  The Trump administration tried to woo Templeton to Washington with a job at the Department of Labor, but Templeton passed. She has amassed a campaign war chest nearly commensurate to McMaster’s. Both are nearing $2 million cash on hand.  Some South Carolina political analysts question whether McMaster, who is entering his fourth decade in politics, may be relying too heavily on Trump’s support to boost his 2018 election chances. Chad Walldorf, a businessman who served in former Gov. Mark Sanford’s administration, said he sees the parallels with Alabama.  “I respect loyalty, but it seems that Trump is again misreading the situation on the ground, getting behind the establishment candidate who was not elected to his position, running against a credible agent of change who’s garnering more significant grassroots support,” he said, referring to Templeton. “At least from the voter standpoint, it seems to me that folks eager for change are eagerly jumping on the Templeton bandwagon.”  Trump, meanwhile, said McMaster was a “talented guy” and said he believed he was doing “really well.”  “You know I’m a poll person. Then I don’t believe ‘em, but I like to read ’em anyway,” Trump said.  ___  Kinnard reported from Columbia, South Carolina.",3.15625,32,"[5.0, 3.5, 3.5, 0.5, 3.5, 3.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.0, 5.0, 4.5, 0.5, 2.5, 3.0, 2.5, 2.5, 3.5, 2.0, 5.0, 3.0, 2.0, 3.0, 2.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0, 2.5, 3.5, 4.0, 3.0, 3.5, 5.0]"

But I was 7 years old. It was an experience I had a thousand years ago.”  Since those television appearances, Rodriguez Aguilera has served as a council member in the city of Doral, where she was appointed vice mayor.

Now, they’re running smack into another complicating factor _ the sheer age and health issues of some senators. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Top Republicans coping with a razor-thin majority in the Senate as they try pushing a partisan agenda are running smack into another complication — the sheer age and health issues of some senators.  One of those ailing senators — 79-year-old Thad Cochran of Mississippi — was back in Washington Tuesday after a month of treatment at home. A statement said he still had urological issues and his treatment “could affect his work schedule.” A day earlier, aides had said Cochran would return to the Senate “when his health permits.”  Cochran’s prolonged absence underscores the challenges of navigating the second-oldest Senate ever. Without him, party leaders could afford just one Republican defector on a pivotal budget vote this week, and the Appropriations Committee that Cochran chairs hasn’t churned out any spending bills for next year since he was last in Washington in mid-September.  Cochran isn’t the only GOP senator with health issues that have caused them to miss time this year in Washington. In July, the Senate delayed votes for a week on repealing President Barack Obama’s health care law after Sen. John McCain of Arizona, now 81, was diagnosed with brain cancer. And Georgia Sen. Johnny Isakson, 72, was away for two back surgeries early in 2017, two years after being diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, a degenerative neurological condition.  In addition, a pair of 80-somethings are up for re-election in 2018, one from each party. They’re among 16 senators facing re-election who come Election Day 2018 will be at least 65 — an age when many people have already retired.  Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, 83, hasn’t announced a final decision on whether he’ll seek an eighth, six-year term next year. On the Democratic side, California’s Dianne Feinstein — at 84 the oldest current senator — has announced she will run again next November. If re-elected, she could serve till she’s 91 — an age reached by only four other senators while in office.  “The ability to get things done counts. And the compassion, vigor, and stamina to make a difference counts,” she said last week, as if pre-emptively fending off questions about her age.  That didn’t stop 50-year-old Kevin De Leon, president pro tem of the California state Senate, who announced on Sunday his Democratic primary challenge to Feinstein.  Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, who turns 70 in November, was diagnosed with kidney cancer this year but has said she’ll seek re-election next November. Also facing re-election are at least three other cancer survivors: Sens. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., Bill Nelson, D-Fla., and Angus King, I-Maine.  Overall, senators averaged 61.8 years old when the current two-year Congress began in January, according to the Senate Historical Office. That’s tied for second oldest with the Senate that began in 2007. That was surpassed only by the two-year session that began in 2009, when senators averaged 62.7 years of age.  Right now, the chamber has seven senators at least 80 years old — excluding Cochran, who reaches that age in December. Seventeen are in their 70s and another 40 are in their 60s. The youngest senator, Arkansas Republican Tom Cotton, turned 40 in May.  Of the nearly 2,000 people who have served as senators, just 42 were still in office at age 80, according to the historical office. The oldest: Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., who left office at age 100 in 2003, six months before he died.  The average age of senators was in the mid- to late 40s during the earliest Congresses. It’s fluctuated but gradually risen since then, in part tracking a steady increase in life expectancy in the U.S. It also reflects a political reality — voters usually like to re-elect incumbents because they value them, so senators are serving longer.  “Most voters at one time or another say they wished senators would serve a term or two and get out,” said Larry Sabato, who directs the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. But when it comes to their own senator they feel, ”‘Seniority is really valuable, we don’t want to lose that,’” he said.  This week, GOP leaders aim to push a budget through the Senate that would lay the groundwork for the chamber to approve huge tax cuts later this year. With a 52-48 majority, Republicans can normally afford just two defections and still approve legislation because Vice President Mike Pence can cast tie-breaking votes.  If Cochran stayed away, the budget would fail if more than one GOP senator votes “no.”  On Monday, chief of staff Brad White said in a statement that Cochran has a urinary tract infection and was remaining in Mississippi “on the advice of his physicians and other health care professionals.”  ___  Associated Press writer Andrew Taylor contributed to this report.",3.65625,32,"[3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 3.0, 4.5, 2.5, 5.0, 3.0, 4.5, 0.5, 3.0, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 5.0, 4.5, 3.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 3.0, 4.5, 3.5, 2.0, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 2.5, 3.0]"

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)  LONDON (AP) — Silicon Valley is a uniquely American creation, the product of an entrepreneurial spirit and no-holds-barred capitalism that now drives many aspects of modern life.  But the likes of Facebook, Google and Apple are increasingly facing an uncomfortable truth: it is Europe’s culture of tougher oversight of companies, not America’s laissez-faire attitude, which could soon rule their industry as governments seek to combat fake news and prevent extremists from using the internet to fan the flames of hatred.  While the U.S. has largely relied on market forces to regulate content in a country where free speech is revered, European officials have shown they are willing to act. Germany recently passed a law imposing fines of up to 50 million euros ($59 million) on websites that don’t remove hate speech within 24 hours. British Prime Minister Theresa May wants companies to take down extremist material within two hours. And across the EU, Google has for years been obliged to remove search results if there is a legitimate complaint about the content’s veracity or relevance.  “I anticipate the EU will be where many of these issues get played out,” said Sarah T. Roberts, a professor of information studies at UCLA who has studied efforts to monitor and vet internet content. Objectionable content “is the biggest problem going forward. It’s no longer acceptable for the firms to say that they can’t do anything about it.”  How closely to manage the massive amounts of content on the internet has become a pressing question in the U.S. since it was revealed that Russian agencies took out thousands of ads on social media during the presidential campaign, reaching some 10 million people on Facebook alone.  That comes on top of the existing concerns about preventing extremist attacks. This month, three men were arrested after allegedly using smartphone messaging apps to plot attacks on the New York City subway and Times Square from their homes in Canada, Pakistan and the Philippines. The plot was thwarted by an undercover officer, not technology.  In some ways it goes to a question of identity. Social media companies see themselves not as publishers but as platforms for other people to share information, and have traditionally been cautious about taking down material.  But the pressure is on to act. Facebook, Google, Twitter and YouTube in June created the Global Internet Forum to Combat Terrorism, which says it is committed to developing new content detection technology, helping smaller companies combat extremism and promoting “counter-speech,” content meant to blunt the impact of extremist material.  Proponents of counter-speech argue that rather than trying to take down every Islamic State group post, internet companies and governments should do more to promote content that actively refutes extremist propaganda. This approach will unmask the extremist message of hate and violence in the “marketplace of ideas,” they argue, though critics see it as just another form of propaganda.  Facebook has recently published details of its counterterrorism strategy for the first time. These include using artificial intelligence to prevent extremist images and videos from being uploaded and algorithms to find and disable accounts linked to pages known to support extremist movements. The company also plans to increase the staff dedicated to reviewing complaints of objectionable material by more than 60 percent to some 8,000 worldwide.  “We want Facebook to be a hostile place for terrorists,” Monika Bickert, director of global policy management, and Brian Fishman, counterterrorism policy manager, said in a statement. “The challenge for online communities is the same as it is for real world communities - to get better at spotting the early signals before it’s too late.”  But Roberts argues the companies have been slow to react and are trying to play catch up.  The fact is the technology needed to detect and remove dangerous posts hasn’t kept up with the threat, experts say. Removing such material still requires judgment, and artificial intelligence is not yet good enough to determine the difference, for example, between an article about the so-called Islamic State and posts from the group itself.  In other words, taking down much of this material still needs human input, said Frank Pasquale, an expert in information law and changing technology at the University of Maryland. Acknowledging that is difficult for companies that were built by pushing the boundaries of technology.  “They don’t like to admit how primitive their technologies are; it defeats their whole narrative that they can save the world,” Pasquale said. “You kill off the golden goose if you cast doubt over the power of their algorithms.”  Employing enough people to fill in where the algorithms leave off would be a massive task given the volume of material posted on social media sites every day. Just imagine trying to moderate every puppy photo or birthday greeting, said Siva Vaidhyanathan, director of the Center for Media and Citizenship at the University of Virginia.  He believes that moderating content is ultimately impossible because you can’t create a system that works for everyone from Saudi Arabia to Sweden.  “The problem is the very idea of the social media system — it is ungovernable,” he said. “Facebook is designed as if we are nice to each other. And we’re not.”  The U.S. government response has been more focused on policing than regulation, with security services authorized to sweep up huge amounts of electronic data to help them identify violent extremists and thwart attacks. Beyond that, authorities have mostly relied on the market to drive change amid fears that heavy-handed regulation could interfere with the First Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens to speak out and exchange information.  European courts have had no such qualms, balancing freedom of expression against the right to privacy and community cohesion.  For example, the European Court of Justice in 2014 ruled that people have the “right to be forgotten,” permitting them to demand removal of personal data from search results when they can prove there’s no compelling reason for it to remain. As far back as 2000, a French court ordered Yahoo to prevent French internet users from buying Nazi memorabilia on its sites.  The European Union’s executive has been most active in matters of antitrust. This year it leveled a huge 2.4 billion euro ($2.8 billion) fine on Google and ordered it to change the way it does business, for example how it shows search results.  “There’s a real cultural divide,” said Edward Tenner, author of the upcoming book “The Efficiency Paradox: What Big Data Can’t Do.” ″European governments have been more committed to incorporating the ideas of social justice and the Americans have been much more on the libertarian side.”",3.48125,80,"[3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.0, 2.5, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 2.0, 2.5, 2.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5, 1.5, 5.0, 3.5, 0.5, 4.5, 3.5, 3.0, 4.5, 5.0, 3.5, 5.0, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 4.0, 1.5, 1.5, 5.0, 0.5, 2.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.0, 2.5, 2.5, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0, 2.5, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5, 5.0, 4.5, 1.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.0, 4.5, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 1.0, 5.0, 3.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 5.0, 3.0, 2.5, 2.0, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5]"

Canadian plane maker Bombardier has a sold a majority stake in its C Series passenger jet business to European aerospace giant Airbus. (Paul Chiasson/The Canadian Press via AP)  TORONTO (AP) — Canadian plane maker Bombardier announced Monday it has sold a majority stake in its C Series passenger jet business to European aerospace giant Airbus for no cost.  U.S. rival Boeing called it a questionable deal by two state-subsidized competitors.  The move comes after lackluster sales and after the U.S. Commerce Department imposed harsh duties on Bombardier, charging the Canadian company is selling the C Series planes in America below cost and receiving government subsidies.  The Commerce Department recently announced it would impose an 80 percent duty on top of duties of nearly 220 percent. The case has been a win for Boeing, which brought the complaint.  Boeing has said it didn’t move early enough against Airbus subsidies in the 1970s. Airbus is now is a global giant.  “This looks like a questionable deal between two heavily state-subsidized competitors to skirt the recent findings of the U.S. government. Our position remains that everyone should play by the same rules for free and fair trade to work,” Boeing spokeman Dan Curran said in a statement.  The move by Bombardier could possibly circumvent duties being imposed on the C Series. The C Series headquarters will remain in the Montreal area but a second assembly line for the 100- to 150-seat plane will be set up at Airbus’ facility in Mobil, Alabama, so the plane can be sold in the United States.  Airbus Chief Executive Office Tom Enders said an aircraft produced at an U.S. Airbus facility would not be subject to duties under the pending U.S. investigation.  Enders said the acquisition extends the company’s product offering into the fast-growing 100-150 seat market sector. The current Airbus A320, a rival for the C Series, is for 180 passengers or more and Airbus hasn’t sold an A320 in three years.  Enders said some airlines have been reluctant to purchase Bombardier’s plane because of doubts the program would continue. It has been bailed out by governments in Quebec and Canada.  “Some customers will be convinced it will be a great product and it is here to stay,” Enders said.  The Airbus acquisition will be subject to Canadian government review but a federal official said the administration is aware of the challenges facing the C Series without a partner of the scale of Airbus. The official noted the plane has stalled at 300 orders but with Airbus they could get up to 6,000 orders over the next 20 to 30 years. The official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the deal, said the federal government has received a guarantee from Airbus that no jobs will be replaced or lost in Quebec because of the deal.  Enders said the talks started in August and were not motivated by what competitors are doing. He rejected a deal to acquire the C Series three years ago but said circumstances have changed, saying the plane is now certified and receiving rave reviews.  Airbus is not assuming any debt as part of the deal and it has an option to buy out Bombardier after 7 1/2 years and the Quebec government in 2023.  The C Series program drove Bombardier to the brink of bankruptcy two years ago before it was bailed out by the Quebec government.  Bombardier chief Alain Bellemare said having Airbus as a strategic partner “increases confidence that the aircraft is here to stay.”  He predicted they will secure more orders and double the value of the program. “By securing the U.S. market you end up securing the program,” he said.  Airbus will acquire a 50.01 percent interest in C Series Aircraft Limited Partnership, which manufactures and sells the plane. Bombardier will own 31 percent and the Quebec government’s investment agency will hold 19 percent.  Montreal-based Bombardier had dreamed of capturing half the global market for 100-to 149-seat planes. It has marketed the plane as being 20 percent more fuel-efficient than the comparable Airbus A320 and Boeing 737.  Chicago-based Boeing’s complaint claims Bombardier’s new C Series passenger aircraft receives Canadian government subsidies that give it an advantage internationally. The Quebec government invested US$1 billion in exchange for a 49.5 percent stake in the C Series last year. Canada’s federal government also recently provided a US$275 million loan to Bombardier, which struggled to win orders.  Bombardier won a 75-plane order for the C Series from U.S.-based Delta Air Lines in 2016. Bombardier said its planes never competed with Boeing in the sale to Delta.  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said his government could stop doing business with Boeing if the U.S. company doesn’t drop its trade complaint against Bombardier. Canada had been in talks to purchase 18 Super Hornet fighter jets from Boeing, but those have been on hold because of the Bombardier dispute.  “The attempt to weaken Bombardier has pushed it to join with one of its competitors, which should not have had needed to happen,” said Jerry Dias, national president of Unifor, Canada’s largest private sector union. “Ultimately, the U.S. actions have created a stronger Bombardier.”",3.2357142857142858,70,"[4.5, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 4.0, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0, 2.5, 2.5, 1.5, 4.5, 2.5, 0.5, 4.0, 1.5, 2.0, 4.5, 1.5, 2.0, 4.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 2.0, 2.5, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 3.0, 5.0, 2.5, 4.5, 2.5, 1.5, 1.5, 5.0, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 2.5, 4.0, 4.5, 2.0, 0.5, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 1.5, 3.5, 5.0, 2.5, 4.5, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0]"

(AP Photo/Elaine Thompson)  SEATTLE (AP) — Memo to the many places vying for Amazon’s second headquarters: It ain’t all food trucks and free bananas.  For years, much of downtown Seattle has been a maze of broken streets and caution-taped sidewalks. Dozens of enormous cranes tower overhead as double-length dump trucks hauling excavated dirt rumble past pedestrians and bicyclists. The crashing and clanging of construction is the city’s soundtrack on a perpetual loop.  Housing prices have soared faster than anywhere else in America, driving some low- and even middle-income residents beyond city limits. Traffic is frequently unmentionable. And while Amazon is far from solely to blame - and while lawmakers, economists and many residents say the benefits clearly outweigh any drawbacks - life in its hometown is indeed one more endeavor the tech giant has disrupted.  “Economic growth brings opportunities, and it brings headaches,” says Margaret O’Mara, a University of Washington professor who specializes in urban history. “That was true in 1840s Manchester, it was true in 1890s Pittsburgh, and it’s true with Seattle in the 20-teens. ... It’s on both cities and the tech companies to figure out the way to handle these things.”  Amazon opened its headquarters in a previously sleepy warehouse district known as South Lake Union in 2010, foregoing what it says would have been the cheaper option of building in the suburbs, where its workers might have been less connected to the city.  Since then, it has expanded from a workforce of about 5,000 to more than 40,000 in 33 buildings here. It surpassed the university as the city’s biggest employer, and it’s still growing apace. Even as it announced plans for a second headquarters location, the company said it would lease the entirety of Seattle’s second-largest skyscraper, the still-under-construction Rainier Square tower, which will have room for 3,500 workers.  The city has been transformed, with new towers seeming to sprout weekly and Amazon’s striking new biospheres due to open next year. Amazon estimates its direct spending boosted Seattle’s economy by $38 billion from 2010 to 2016. Hotels are thriving thanks to visits by friends and family of Amazon workers, as well as by Amazon employees from elsewhere. The Downtown Seattle Association estimates $5 billion in construction activity was underway during the summer, with more than 30,000 residential units in the works.  Cities across the U.S. and Canada are clamoring at the prospect of landing Amazon’s second headquarters - and with it, investments topping $5 billion. They have until Thursday to submit their proposals.  In Seattle, there’s no question the company’s growth has improved life in many ways. Unemployment is extremely low. A large fraction of its workers walk to the office or rely on public transit, and its buildings have green roofs, recycled heat, reclaimed lumber and other sustainability features. It opened plazas where it hosts farmers markets, concerts and, yes, banana stands - Amazon has given away 2.7 million bananas and counting.  Terrific restaurants, cafes and food trucks have proliferated, with lines of Amazon workers - recognizable by their badges or by their dogs, welcome at work - outside.  That said, not everyone can afford to enjoy such amenities. Robby Stern, president of Puget Sound Advocates for Retirement Action, which advocates for seniors, said rising housing costs have forced two of his organization’s board members from the city. The Seattle Times reported in September that the median house price in the city was $730,000 - double what it was five years ago.  “Bringing a lot of new, good-paying jobs to town, you have to view that as being a positive development,” Stern said. “But the changes that have happened have created Seattle as a less livable place for categories of people, and that’s not what I want for Seattle.”  After taking some criticism for a perceived lack of involvement in the community, Amazon has engaged more publicly, including supporting some beloved Seattle nonprofits: It announced this year that it will give the shelter organization Mary’s Place permanent room in its new building to house 200 homeless women, children and families. It has also given FareStart, which trains people struggling with homelessness or drug addiction to work in the restaurant industry, space and equipment to open five new eateries on its campus.  Last year, Amazon gave $10 million toward a new computer sciences building at the University of Washington, where it also endowed two professorships. And this year, the family of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos announced a $35 million gift to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center - the largest donation in the center’s 41-year history.  The company also donated to a successful political campaign last fall to expand light rail service, and has paid for an additional streetcar to serve South Lake Union.  Seattle had bad traffic and limited housing even before Amazon arrived - some of which lingered from decades of anti-growth policies and a failure to build more mass transit sooner.  With Amazon’s bidding process for “HQ2,” at least the places applying know what to expect.  Greg Nickels, the city’s mayor from 2002 to 2010, worked to transform South Lake Union into a tech and biotech hub. He says Seattle has had to do some catching up on transit and housing, given the company’s unpredictably explosive expansion, and the city’s $15-an-hour minimum wage experiment is a good one to try to alleviate income inequality.  “I know many people find that growth uncomfortable, but it’s much better than being a Detroit or a Cleveland, where people are watching their cities waste away,” Nickels said.",3.8768115942028984,69,"[4.5, 3.5, 4.0, 2.5, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 0.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 4.0, 0.5, 3.5, 4.0, 5.0, 2.5, 2.5, 3.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 2.5, 5.0, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.0, 1.5, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 5.0, 4.5, 3.5]"
734,2148,10,20,2017,2017-10-20,Associated Press News,"Wooing Amazon with sun, fun ... and giant buttons"," Mayors from Toledo to Tulsa are so eager to woo Amazon’s much-vaunted second headquarters that they’ve been brandishing bourbon, selling the sun, whispering sweet nothings to the company and even pushing its buttons.  Literally.  The Associated Press talked to the leaders of more than 50 cities or metropolitan regions about the different ways they’re showcasing themselves to the Seattle e-commerce company. The bids are due Thursday.  300 DAYS IN THE SUN (OR MORE)  It’s easy for many metropolitan areas to emphasize their similarities to Seattle. It’s a little gutsier for cities to cast themselves as an escape from the rainy Pacific Northwest.  “We have 300 days of sunshine,” says J.J. Ament, chief executive officer of the Metro Denver Economic Development Corp. “Our skies are bluer and prettier.” Ament’s organization is compiling a formal bid that also highlights Colorado’s 45,000 miles of hiking, biking and all-purpose trails.  Austin, coincidentally enough, also touts 300 sunny days and outdoor activities — plus live music, festivals, sports and a “big foodie-friendly community,” says Mike Berman, a spokesman for the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce.  But wait: Albuquerque, New Mexico, has upped the ante with a claimed 310 cloudless days. (The city also makes a naked plea to sentiment, noting that it’s the birthplace of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.)  YOU DASHING ROGUE  Many cities are flirting with the idea of landing Amazon’s new headquarters. One Alabama city is REALLY flirting.  “Amazon, we got a 100% match on Bumble. Wanna go on a date?” Birmingham asks the company in one of hundreds of Tweets it has sent the company.  The city even set up giant replicas of Amazon’s Dash Buttons — those dangerous order-a-product-with-a-single-press gizmos — to send one of more than 600 pre-generated tweets to the company.  “We are Chipotle and these other cities are Taco Bell, Amazon,” one said.  BEER AND BOURBON ABOUND  Bars, pubs, taverns, wine bars. Many cities insist they’ve got the best options for Amazon happy hour (assuming that local alcohol laws allow it).  “We have 348 breweries in Colorado, second only to California,” says Denver’s Ament. “That’s six per 100,000 residents.”  Louisville is playing up its role as the gateway to Kentucky bourbon country. Even the farthest-flung locales lay claim to a vibrant nightlife.  “Lots of bars and restaurants, plays, lots of music,” says Mike Savage, mayor of Halifax, Nova Scotia. The city, one of several in Canada making a bid, once billed itself as “the next Seattle” based on its 1990s grunge scene.  HOT (AND HIP) OR NOT  Looking for hot and hip? “Providence is particularly hot and hip,” says Rhode Island Commerce Secretary Stefan Pryor, who led efforts to craft a pitch for the country’s smallest state. “Our capital city was identified by GQ, Gentleman’s Quarterly magazine, as the coolest city in America.” (This is true .)  Others are happier embracing their hip-to-be-squareness.  “We’re sort of a put-your-head-down community, where we just work real hard and build real business,” says Howard Tullman, the CEO of 1871, a Chicago tech incubator.

Albuquerque also brags about an absence of earthquakes and hurricanes.  That could be important if Amazon wants to avoid rising sea levels or extreme weather.

But Newark also offers Amazon the opportunity to make a “strong social impact statement,” says Aisha Glover, president of the Newark Community Economic Development Corp.  Karen Freeman-Wilson, the mayor in post-industrial Gary, Indiana, says Amazon should use this opportunity to “leave a legacy as having transformed or been a part of the transformation of a legacy city.”  NO THANKS, AMAZON  And then there are those hardy communities that simply decided they’re better off not making a desperate pitch.  Alaska, for instance, didn’t even bother applying, given Amazon’s requirement for a metro area with more than a million residents. (There aren’t that many people in the entire state.)  San Antonio, Texas, meanwhile, says it was turned off by the bidding war Amazon is creating among states and cities.  “Blindly giving away the farm isn’t our style,” city officials wrote in an open letter to Bezos.  __  Associated Press writers Sophia Tareen in Chicago, James Anderson in Denver, Diana Heidgerd in Dallas, Kristen de Groot in Philadelphia, Bruce Shipkowski in Trenton, New Jersey, Becky Bohrer in Juneau, Alaska, Susan Montoya Bryan in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Jennifer McDermott in Providence, Rhode Island, Andrew Welsh-Huggins in Columbus, Ohio, Tom Davies in Indianapolis, Bruce Schreiner in Louisville, Kentucky and Jeff Martin in Atlanta contributed to this report.",3.525,60,"[4.0, 0.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 4.0, 5.0, 4.5, 5.0, 4.5, 0.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.0, 1.5, 1.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0, 2.0, 4.0, 5.0, 1.0, 2.5, 4.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 1.5, 3.0, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 2.0, 5.0, 2.0, 4.0, 4.5, 2.0, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 2.5, 0.5, 4.0, 3.5, 2.5, 0.5]"

Twitter vowed to crack down further on hate speech and sexual harassment on its platform, days after CEO Jack Dorsey said in a tweet-storm that the company was ""still"" not doing enough to protect its users. In an email shared with The Associated Press Tuesday, Oct. 17, 2017, Twitter's head of safety policy outlined the new guidelines to the company's Trust and Safety Council, a group of outside organizations that advises Twitter on its policies against abuse. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)  NEW YORK (AP) — Twitter is vowing to crack down further on hate speech and sexual harassment, days after CEO Jack Dorsey said in a tweetstorm that the company is not doing enough to protect its users.  The company has spent the last two years trying to clamp down on hate and abuse on its generally free-wheeling service.  Dorsey echoed concerns of many users and critics who say Twitter it hasn’t done enough to curb the abuse. But others worry that it’s muzzling free speech in the process.  In an email Twitter shared with The Associated Press Tuesday, the company’s head of safety policy outlined the proposed new guidelines that tighten existing rules and impose some new ones. They aim to close loopholes that allowed people to glorify violence, for example.  The email was sent to the company’s Trust and Safety Council, a group of outside organizations that advises Twitter on its policies against abuse.  “It’s good that Twitter is thinking these things through and being fairly transparent about what they are doing,” said Emma Llanso, director of the free expression project at the Center for Democracy and Technology, a nonprofit that’s a member of the Trust and Safety Council. But, she added, it will be very important to have a clear appeals process and ways to review whether the policies are effective.  Twitter sent it to the group for input, and the changes are not yet final. News of the changes was first reported by Wired .  WHAT’S CHANGING?  Some of the changes are aimed at protecting women who unknowingly or unwillingly had nude pictures of themselves distributed online or were subject to unwanted sexual advances. They would also try to shield groups subject to hateful imagery, symbols and threats of violence.  Among the proposed changes, Twitter said it would immediately and permanently suspend any account it identifies as being the original poster of “non-consensual nudity,” including so-called “creep shots” of a sexual nature taken surreptitiously. Previously, the company treated the original poster of the content the same as those who re-tweeted it, and it resulted only in a temporary suspension.  It said it would also develop a system allowing bystanders on Twitter to report unwanted exchanges of sexually charged content, whereas in the past it relied on one of the parties involved in the conversation to come forward before taking action. Twitter already allows bystanders to report other violations on behalf of someone else.  The San Francisco-based company also said it would take new action on hate symbols and imagery and “take enforcement action against organizations that use/have historically used violence as a means to advance their cause,” though it said more details were to come.  It didn’t say what the hate symbols might be and enforcing this could prove difficult. While some hate symbols, like the swastika, are widely recognized, groups have also adopted lesser-known, seemingly innocuous symbols to show hate. Those include “Pepe the Frog,” a cartoon frog that has become a symbol for the “alt-right” movement known for racist and misogynist views. The milk emoji has also been used by white supremacists as an online symbol.  Twitter already takes action against direct threats of violence, the company said it would also act against tweets that glorify or condone violence.  IS IT ENOUGH? TOO MUCH?  On Friday, Dorsey foreshadowed the coming policy changes in a series of tweets, saying the company’s efforts over the last two years were inadequate.  “Today we saw voices silencing themselves and voices speaking out because we’re (asterisk)still(asterisk) not doing enough,” Dorsey tweeted.  At the same time, Llanso said, Twitter also must tread carefully not to sweep up legitimate discourse along with hate speech and abuse. Unlike Facebook, Twitter permits anonymity. While this can be used as a tool for abuse and harassment, it also allows for people and groups to speak out when they otherwise couldn’t.  “Any kind of policy that is about taking down speech online, will be used for its intended purpose, but also by others who are looking to get things censored online,” she said. “People out there looking to silence voices they disagree with are very savvy.”  In the end, whether the policies work will have to be tested out in the field, by Twitter’s users.  “There will definitely be mistakes,” Llanso said.  RUSSIA SCRUTINY  The moves also come amid intense scrutiny from congressional investigators into how Russian agents used Twitter, Facebook and Google to influence last year’s U.S. election. Twitter has said it would appear at a public congressional hearing on Nov. 1 after already briefing a Senate committee.  The company has handed over the handles, or profile names, of 201 accounts it believes were linked to Russia. It has also said at least $274,000 in U.S. ads were bought by Russia Today, a Russian-government-linked media outlet, last year.  ___  AP Technology Writer Ryan Nakashima contributed to this story from Menlo Park, California.",3.33,50,"[0.5, 2.5, 2.5, 4.5, 4.0, 1.0, 5.0, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 1.0, 4.5, 2.5, 4.5, 4.5, 2.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.5, 2.5, 5.0, 0.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5, 2.5, 3.5, 1.5, 3.0, 4.0, 3.0, 5.0, 0.5, 5.0, 0.5, 2.5, 4.5, 4.5, 0.5, 2.5, 4.5, 4.5, 1.5, 4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.0, 2.5]"

Scott Applewhite, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — As congressional investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 elections wear on in the Capitol, some lawmakers are starting to wonder when — and how — the probes will end.  After months of clandestine interviews and a few public, partisan committee clashes, some Republicans on the House intelligence panel have privately been pushing for their probe to wrap up by the end of the year. And Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., is signaling he wants his more bipartisan investigation to finish in the next several months, before the 2018 elections get into full swing and the Russians have a chance to again interfere.  It’s still unclear whether the congressional committees looking into the interference will come to firm conclusions about whether President Donald Trump’s campaign was involved, or if they have found any direct evidence of any collaboration with Russia. Those involved say it’s too early to know if they will be able to issue bipartisan reports, and whether those reports will have firm conclusions or just be a series of findings.  With no ability to do criminal investigations and difficulty in getting some witnesses to appear, the panels could leave some of the more controversial assessments to special counsel Robert Mueller, who is also investigating the meddling and the question of whether Trump’s campaign was involved. Mueller has the ability to prosecute, and Congress must refer any criminal findings to him.  “I think there are lots of Republicans who just want this to go away, and I think the White House very much wants it to go away,” Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., said Tuesday. “So I don’t think it’s necessarily the easiest call in the world for our Republican colleagues.”  Trump made his views clear, again, at a Monday news conference, saying “the whole Russian thing” is an excuse for Democrats who lost the presidential election.  “So there has been absolutely no collusion,” Trump said. “It’s been stated that they have no collusion. They ought to get to the end of it, because I think the American public is sick of it.”  In the Senate, Burr has worked closely with the top Democrat on the intelligence panel, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner. Burr said Tuesday that the committee “needs to have some conclusion in time to get ready for the 2018 elections ... that gives you a window of somewhere between the end of the year and maybe February.”  Burr said the panel’s timeline is unrelated to Mueller’s probe.  “They’re on a criminal investigation and we’re looking at Russian influence in the election,” Burr said, adding that he hopes his investigation will be done before Mueller’s.  At a news conference with Warner on Oct. 4, Burr said the issue of collusion is “still open.” He has said repeatedly that the committee has continued to find new threads, and that a firm timeline isn’t possible. He said the committee has 25 interviews this month, including two public hearings related to the investigation. The panel has still yet to talk to Donald Trump Jr. and other witnesses who attended a June 2016 campaign meeting with Russians.  “We’ve still got a fairly long list of people to see, and it’s more of a mathematical equation now,” Burr said.  The head of the House intelligence probe, Republican Rep. Mike Conaway of Texas, has similarly said the committee is continuing to follow leads and he has declined to set out a timeline. He took over the investigation after the GOP chairman of the intelligence committee, California Rep. Devin Nunes, stepped back amid criticism that he was too close to Trump’s White House.  Some other Republicans on the House panel have questioned how long it should go on.  “It’s getting old,” said Republican Rep. Tom Rooney of Florida, a member of the intelligence panel. He said the committee should not “prolong the investigation for the sake of prolonging it. Those days are going to come to an end here soon.”  Rooney said the panel should stick to witnesses that are directly related to the meddling and to the intelligence community, which is the committee’s jurisdiction. He said once the committee has interviewed enough pertinent witnesses he’d recommend to Conaway and House Speaker Ryan that the panel write a final report and conclude the probe.  Democrats on the House intelligence committee are trying to head off calls to end the investigations. California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the panel, said in a Washington Post op-ed over the weekend that some witnesses have been “rushed” before the committee amid White House calls to end the probe. Schiff said that the panel has much more work to do, and, unlike with Mueller’s probe, the point of the congressional investigations is to “tell the American people what happened or prescribe remedies.”  Schiff notes that Congress also could serve as a conduit for some of Mueller’s findings, if he declines to issue his own report. But it’s unclear whether the Justice Department will share that information with Capitol Hill.  Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, believes that it’s too soon to wrap up. The Judiciary panel is also doing an investigation, but its probe has moved slowly amid negotiations over witnesses.  “I feel the pressure to move forward at a better pace, but not necessarily to finish,” Blumenthal said, adding: “The Russians are going to do it again ... unless they pay a price they will heighten their interference in our elections.”",4.0,10,"[5.0, 4.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.0, 2.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.0]"

On Tuesday, Oct. 17, 2017 a federal judge in Hawaii blocked the Trump administration from enforcing its latest travel ban, just hours before it was set to take effect. U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson granted Hawaii's request to temporarily block the policy from taking effect Wednesday. (AP Photo/Caleb Jones, File)  HONOLULU (AP) — A federal judge in Hawaii blocked most of President Donald Trump’s latest travel ban Tuesday, just hours before it was set to take effect, saying the revised order “suffers from precisely the same maladies as its predecessor.”  It was the third set of travel restrictions issued by the president to be thwarted, in whole or in part, by the courts.  U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson issued the ruling after the ban on a set of mostly Muslim countries was challenged by the state of Hawaii, which warned that the restrictions would separate families and undermine the recruiting of diverse college students.  White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders called the ruling “dangerously flawed” and said it “undercuts the president’s efforts to keep the American people safe.” The Justice Department said it will quickly appeal.  At issue was a ban, announced in September and set to go into effect early Wednesday, on travelers from Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, along with some Venezuelan government officials and their families.  The Trump administration said the ban was based on an assessment of each country’s security situation and willingness to share information with the U.S.  Watson, appointed to the bench by President Barack Obama, said the new restrictions ignore a federal appeals court ruling against Trump’s previous ban.  The latest version “plainly discriminates based on nationality in the manner that the 9th Circuit has found antithetical to ... the founding principles of this nation,” Watson wrote.  The judge’s ruling applies only to the six Muslim-majority countries on the list. It does not affect the restrictions against North Korea or Venezuela, because Hawaii did not ask for that.  “This is the third time Hawaii has gone to court to stop President Trump from issuing a travel ban that discriminates against people based on their nation of origin or religion,” Hawaii Attorney General Doug Chin said in a statement. “Today is another victory for the rule of law.”  Hawaii argued the updated ban was a continuation of Trump’s campaign call for a ban on Muslims, despite the addition of two countries without a Muslim majority.  Watson noted that Hawaii had argued Trump did not back down from that call, listing in the ruling a series of June tweets “in which (Trump) complained about how the Justice Department had submitted a ‘watered down, politically correct version’ to the Supreme Court.”  Other courts that weighed the travel ban have cited Trump’s comments about banning Muslims, including the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Virginia and a federal judge in Maryland. Watson also referred to a Trump campaign statement in his previous ruling.  His Tuesday ruling said the new ban, like its predecessor, fails to show that nationality alone makes a person a greater security risk to the U.S.  “The categorical restrictions on entire populations of men, women and children, based upon nationality, are a poor fit for the issues regarding the sharing of ‘public-safety and terrorism-related information’ that the president identifies,” Watson wrote.  He said the ban is inconsistent in the way some countries are included or left out. For example, Iraq failed to meet the security benchmark but was omitted from the ban. Somalia met the information-sharing benchmark but was included.  “Judge Watson’s ruling makes clear that we are a nation of laws, no matter what this administration may try to do,” Hawaii’s U.S. Sen. Brian Schatz said in a statement. “There is a place here for peaceful immigrants from every corner of the world: Spain, Syria, Sudan, or Singapore. There is no place here for discrimination or xenophobia.”  Watson found fault with what sorts of visitors are barred. For instance, all tourists and business travelers from Libya are excluded from the U.S., but student visitors were allowed.  The judge said he would set an expedited hearing to determine whether the temporary restraining order blocking the ban should be extended. It comes as other courts weigh challenges to the ban.  In Maryland, the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups are seeking to block the visa and entry restrictions. Washington state, Massachusetts, California, Oregon, New York and Maryland are challenging the order in front of the same federal judge in Seattle who struck down Trump’s initial ban in January.  That ban — aimed mostly at Muslim-majority countries — led to chaos and confusion at airports nationwide and triggered several lawsuits, including one from Hawaii.  When Trump revised the ban, Hawaii challenged that version, too, and Watson agreed it discriminated on the basis of nationality and religion. A subsequent U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowed the administration to partially reinstate restrictions against Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and against all refugees.  Hawaii then successfully challenged the government’s definition of which relatives of people already living in the U.S. would be allowed into the country, and Watson ordered the list expanded.",4.25,12,"[4.5, 5.0, 2.0, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 3.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.5, 4.5]"
741,2155,10,18,2017,2017-10-18,Associated Press News,"Sessions defends Comey firing, dodges questions on Trump"," Attorney General Jeff Sessions strongly defended President Donald Trump’s firing of James Comey, but at a Senate hearing Wednesday repeatedly declined to discuss private conversations with the president about the dismissal, frustrating Democratic lawmakers who wanted to link the firing of the FBI director to a broader inquiry into Russian election meddling.  The repeated, often-testy questioning about the Russia investigation, coming even as Sessions spearheads sweeping changes to the Justice Department in the areas of LGBT rights, criminal justice and immigration, illustrates the extent to which the probe continues to shadow Sessions even though he recused himself months ago.  Sessions advised the Senate Judiciary Committee at the outset of his first oversight hearing as attorney general that he would not answer any questions about conversations with the president that he considered confidential.  He largely adhered to that principle during the five-hour hearing, refusing to say what Trump told him about his reasons for wanting to fire Comey, whether Trump confided in him his concern about “lifting the cloud” of the Russia investigation and whether he had asked him to drop a criminal case against Sheriff Joe Arpaio in Arizona.  Democratic Sen. Al Franken is accusing Attorney General Jeff Sessions of ""moving the goalposts"" in denying his interactions with the Russian ambassador. (Oct. 18)  Sessions deflected the questions by maintaining that presidents are entitled to have private discussions with Cabinet secretaries, saying at one point, “I do not confirm or deny the existence of any communication between the president that I consider to be confidential.”  Still, Sessions’ defense of the Comey firing — and his insistence that it stemmed from the handling of the Hillary Clinton email case — was consistent with the initial explanation by the White House. It was, he said, “the first time I’m aware of” in which an FBI director had performed the traditional role of Justice Department prosecutors by announcing on his own the conclusion of a federal investigation — that no charges would be brought against Clinton.  He said he was further galled when Comey, shortly before his firing, insisted to Congress that he would have taken the same actions again.  “That was a fairly stunning event for both of us and it did highlight the problem more significantly than it had been before,” Sessions said, referring to Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein.  Though he refused to say whether he discussed with Trump Comey’s involvement in the Russia investigation, he did say that the president had asked him and Rosenstein for their recommendations about what to do with Comey.  But that explanation has been muddled by Trump himself, who days after the May 9 firing said he would have fired Comey even without the Justice Department’s recommendation and that he was thinking of “this Russia thing” when he dismissed him.  The circumstances of Comey’s firing are among many events being investigated by Robert Mueller, who was appointed as the Justice Department’s special counsel to look into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to influence the outcome of the 2016 election.  After initially balking at the question, Sessions said Mueller’s team had not interviewed him as part of its investigation.  The hearing marked a return to the Judiciary Committee for Sessions, who served on it for years as a Republican senator. Yet his interactions with his former peers have been frayed as attorney general, particularly amid Democratic accusations that he provided misleading testimony at his confirmation hearing about his contacts with the Russian ambassador.  He bickered with Sen. Al Franken, a Minnesota Democrat, who accused him of having moved the “goalpost” in his denials about his contacts with the ambassador.  He said that while Sessions had initially denied having any contacts with Russians during the campaign, he later qualified his answer to say that he had not discussed any matters related to the campaign. Sessions repeated Wednesday that he had done nothing improper and had given a “good-faith” response.  Apart from Russia, Sessions faced questions from lawmakers about his swift undoing of Obama-era protections for gay and transgender people and his rollback of criminal justice policies that aimed to reduce the federal prison population, among other changes he has made in the nine months since taking office.  Franken praised his decision to send an experienced federal hate crimes prosecutor to assist in a transgender murder case in Iowa, but said his Justice Department has “demonstrated an unrelenting hostility toward LGBT people,” an assertion Sessions disputed.  Sessions has tried to pressure so-called sanctuary cities into cooperating with federal immigration authorities by threatening to withhold grant money, and he was the public face of the Trump administration’s decision to end a program benefiting hundreds of thousands of young people who entered the U.S. illegally as children. Congress is seeking a legislative solution to extend the protections before recipients’ work permits expire.  He tussled with Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois over whether people living in the country illegally are driving Chicago’s gun violence. The city has been in the Trump administration’s crosshairs for refusing to help immigration authorities detain and deport immigrants. Durbin said he wanted Chicago officers doing community policing and not immigration work.  “How does that make the city of Chicago safer when you don’t remove criminals who are illegally in the country?” Sessions said.  It is standard policy for attorneys general to appear before the Justice Department’s congressional overseers on the House and Senate judiciary committees.  Yet, in a reflection of the extent to which the Russia investigation and his own role as a Trump campaign ally have dominated public attention, Sessions first appeared months ago before the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is conducting its own probe of election meddling.",3.5,9,"[0.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5, 0.5, 4.5, 4.0, 5.0]"
742,2156,10,17,2017,2017-10-17,Associated Press News,North Korea says it plans to launch many more satellites,"North Korea says it plans to launch many more satellites  UNITED NATIONS (AP) — North Korea’s deputy U.N. ambassador said Tuesday the country plans to launch many more satellites and accused the United States of trying to block its efforts to help peacefully develop outer space.  Kim In Ryong told a U.N. General Assembly committee meeting on “International Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space” that the country’s five-year plan for 2016-2020 includes development of “practical satellites that can contribute to the economic development and improvement of the people’s living.”  As a party to several space treaties, North Korea’s space development activities are “all ground on legal basis in all aspects,” Kim said.  But he said the United States is “going frantic to illegalize our development of outer space,” claiming the effort violates U.N. sanctions.  “The U.S. is the country that launched the largest number of satellites and yet it claims that our launch of satellites is a threat to international peace and security,” Kim said. “This is a preposterous allegation and extreme double standards.”  The United Nations, the U.S. and other countries view the North’s space launch development project as a cover for tests of missile technology, as ballistic missiles and rockets in satellite launches share similar bodies, engines and other technology. North Korea is also openly working on developing nuclear-armed missiles capable of striking the U.S. mainland.  Kim said the treaty on outer space states that it is “a common asset of humankind and all countries can develop outer space without any discrimination.” He said no article states that satellite launches threaten international peace and security, “nor is there any article stipulating that one cannot use ballistic rocket technology in launching a satellite.” He said the U.S. relies on “illegal” U.N. resolutions, referring to Security Council actions taken in response to North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.  Kim said North Korea’s right “to produce and launch artificial satellites will not be changed just because the U.S. denies it.”  He said North Korea launched its first pilot communications satellite, Kwangmyongsong-1, in August 1998. In February 2016, with the successful entry into orbit of Kwangmyongsong-4, he said the country “entered the practical satellite developing stage.”  Last September, Kim said, North Korea successfully tested a new high-thrust motor for the launch vehicle for a geostationary satellite, which “opened up a broad avenue to the exploration of outer space.” He said a successful ground test on March 18 “signified a great leap in the development of space technology and consolidated the scientific and technological foundation to match the world-level satellite delivery capability in the field of outer space development.”  North Korea “will launch many more practical satellites” and “will continue its peaceful development of space” while strengthening international cooperation and exchanges in that field, the ambassador said.",2.857142857142857,14,"[2.5, 0.5, 1.0, 4.0, 4.5, 1.5, 0.5, 5.0, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 0.5]"

A Russian cargo ship has been launched to take supplies to the six astronauts aboard the International Space Station. (Roscosmos Space Agency Press Service photo via AP)  DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Parts of an unmanned Russian cargo spaceship burned across the night sky of the Arabian Peninsula, drawing gasps from Dubai to Riyadh before breaking up in the Earth’s atmosphere and scattering in the Indian Ocean.  The fiery end Monday night to parts of Progress MS-07 came as planned after it delivered 2.5 metric tons (2.75 tons) of water, food and scientific equipment to the astronauts aboard the International Space Station.  But its 80-second appearance in the skies of the United Arab Emirates stunned onlookers in a region where Iran regularly test-fires ballistic missiles and Shiite rebels in Yemen have threatened to use them against Abu Dhabi. Even a day later, government officials still hadn’t corrected their earlier statements identifying the object as a meteor.  The disposable spacecraft blasted off Saturday from the Russian-leased Baikonur launch complex in Kazakhstan. Its rockets and stages earlier fell harmlessly and largely unnoticed into the atmosphere, said Hasan Ahmad al-Hariri, the CEO of the Dubai Astronomy Group.  Parts of the ship could be seen re-entering the atmosphere from 7:35 p.m. (1535 GMT) Monday, al-Hariri said. It streaked across the Dubai skyline behind the Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building, drawing both stunned and anxious reaction from those watching.  “It was quite visible for the public,” al-Hariri told The Associated Press. “It’s not something you see every day. It was beautiful to see that thing up in the sky, disintegrating into pieces.”  Soon, “people were banging me with calls,” he said.  The governmental Dubai Media Office, citing the sheikhdom’s Mohammed bin Rashid Space Center, quickly described the aerial display a “meteorite.” The UAE’s General Civil Aviation Authority said in a statement that “the meteor was a natural and regular phenomenon at this time of the year.”  But it wasn’t a meteor. Al-Hariri said it was a 6.5-meter (21.3-foot)-long “module” from the launch breaking up some 140 kilometers (87 miles) in the sky.  NASA told the AP on Tuesday night that the spaceship’s cargo made it to the International Space Station early Monday morning. U.S. Strategic Command, which oversees America’s nuclear and missile arsenal, told the AP the object over Dubai was the ship’s SL-4 rocket body.  “It re-entered the atmosphere Oct. 16, 2017, over the Persian Gulf at approximately 1530” GMT, said U.S. Air Force Maj. Brian L. Maguire.  The Mohammed bin Rashid Space Center, which hopes to launch a probe to Mars in 2020, did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.  The UAE announced in February it wanted to build the first city on Mars by 2117.  For al-Hariri, whose semi-governmental organization hopes to soon open its Al Thuraya Astronomy Center along the flight path of the Dubai International Airport, the incident Monday night shows the importance of educating the public about the wonders of space.

The environmental group issued a report on Tuesday giving technology titans like Samsung Electronics, Amazon and Huawei low marks for their environmental impact. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)  SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — The environmental group Greenpeace issued a report on Tuesday giving technology titans including Samsung Electronics, Amazon and Huawei low marks for their environmental impact.  Many of the biggest technology companies failed to deliver on commitments to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and are still reluctant to commit fully to renewable energy, according to Greenpeace USA’s Guide to Greener Electronics. The report, which assessed 17 top global tech companies in three areas, also faulted many of them for failing to use more recycled materials in their products and slow progress in phasing out use of toxic materials.  “Tech companies claim to be at the forefront of innovation, but their supply chains are stuck in the Industrial Age,” Gary Cook, a campaigner at Greenpeace USA, said in a statement.  The report details the hidden cost behind what may be the most sought-after and celebrated consumer products in the 21st century: mobile computing devices like smartphones and tablet computers.  Since 2011, Greenpeace has urged global tech companies to transition to renewable energy, prompting some of them to switch to environmentally friendly power sources for their data centers. The group is urging the industry to tackle energy issues in manufacturing and supply chains, design longer-lasting products to reduce electronics waste and urging an overall rethink of its “take-make-waste” business model.  The report highlighted that tech companies’ manufacturing processes are not as environmentally friendly as their innovative images might suggest.  While the energy consumption in the tech industry rose rapidly to fuel the supply chains and the manufacturing of these products as well as the data centers where social media, cloud computing and other applications run, so have the greenhouse gas emissions.  Samsung Electronics received a grade of D in its use of renewable energy, which accounted for just 1 percent of its manufacturing process, compared with Apple, which relied on renewable energy for 96 percent of its operation. Samsung, the world’s largest maker of smartphones and key component suppliers of many of the tech companies featured in the report, saw its greenhouse gas emissions rise 24 percent in 2016 from two years ago. It also received low marks on its efforts to reduce and disclose hazardous chemicals at workplaces and to design long-lasting products.  Samsung Electronics and other companies mentioned in the report did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.  Chinese smartphone makers Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo have gained a significant share of the market in the last few years. They scored below average in all categories and lacked transparency and commitment in renewable energy, the report said.  Amazon was the only U.S. company that received the lowest mark, an F, in its overall environmental performance, along with the Chinese phone makers. Greenpeace said Amazon was among the least transparent companies and did not report the greenhouse gas footprint of its own operations.  Among the 17 companies, Amsterdam-based Fairphone and Apple were said to be doing better in various areas.  Greenpeace urged the companies to use more renewable energy, switching energy sources that power their supply chains. It also urged the tech companies to remove hazardous chemicals and other materials from their products and workplaces and design longer-lasting devices to help reduce waste.  If the tech industry does not change to renewable energy, the world won’t be able to tackle climate change, said Greenpeace campaigner Lee Insung.  “In the next three to five years, the use of renewable energy and how well the companies cope with climate change will determine their core competitiveness,” Lee said.  ___  The report: www.greenpeace.org/greenerguide",2.764705882352941,17,"[3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0, 0.5, 3.5, 2.5, 0.5, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 0.5, 2.5, 2.5, 0.5, 2.5]"

Sophisticated gene tests suggested it would fight her gastric cancer, and they were right. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull)  SAN DIEGO (AP) — Doctors were just guessing a decade ago when they gave Alison Cairnes’ husband a new drug they hoped would shrink his lung tumors. Now she takes it, but the choice was no guesswork. Sophisticated gene tests suggested it would fight her gastric cancer, and they were right.  Cancer patients increasingly are having their care guided by gene tumor boards, a new version of the hospital panels that traditionally decided whether surgery, radiation or chemotherapy would be best. These experts study the patient’s cancer genes and match treatments to mutations that seem to drive the disease.  “We dissect the patient’s tumor with what I call the molecular microscope,” said Dr. Razelle Kurzrock, who started a board at the University of California, San Diego, where Cairnes is treated.  It’s the kind of care many experts say we should aim for — precision medicine, the right drug for the right person at the right time, guided by genes. There are success stories, but also some failures and many questions:  Will gene-guided care improve survival? Does it save money or cost more? What kind of gene testing is best, and who should get it?  “I think every patient needs it,” especially if cancer is advanced, said Kurzrock, who consults for some gene-medicine companies. “Most people don’t agree with me — yet. In five years, it may be malpractice not to do genomics.”  (AP Video/Kathy Young)  Few people get precision medicine today, said Dr. Eric Topol, head of the Scripps Translational Science Institute. “The only thing that’s gone mainstream are the words.”  HOW IT WORKS NOW  If you have a cancer that might be susceptible to a gene-targeting drug, you may be tested for mutations in that gene, such as HER2 for breast cancer. Some breast or prostate cancer patients also might get a multi-gene test to gauge how aggressive treatment should be.  Then most patients get usual guideline-based treatments. If there’s no clear choice, or if the disease has spread or comes back, doctors may suggest tumor profiling — comprehensive tests to see what mutations dominate.  That’s traditionally been done from a tissue sample, but newer tests that detect tumor DNA in blood — liquid biopsies — are making profiling more common. The tests cost about $6,000 and many insurers consider them experimental and won’t pay.  Gene tumor boards analyze what the results suggest about treatment. They focus on oddball cases like a breast cancer mutation in a colon cancer patient, or cancers that have widely spread and are genetically complex. The only options may be experimental drugs or “off-label” treatments — medicines approved for different situations.  But as tumor profiling grows, it’s revealing how genetically diverse many tumors are, and that oddball cases are not so rare, said Dr. John Marshall. He heads the virtual tumor board at Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center that also serves cancer centers in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Michigan and Tennessee.  “There is a little bit of faith” that testing will show the right treatment, but it’s not a sure thing, said Dr. Lee Schwartzberg, who heads one participating center, the West Cancer Center in Memphis.  Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, the American Cancer Society’s deputy chief medical officer, is optimistic yet wary. Drugs that target BRAF mutations work well for skin cancers called melanomas, but less well for lung or colon cancers.  “Just because a mutation occurs it doesn’t mean that drug is going to work in that cancer,” he said.  LUCKY CASES  When it does, results can be dramatic. Cairnes’ cancer was between her stomach and esophagus, and had spread to her liver, lungs and lymph nodes. Tissue testing found 10 abnormal genes, but on the liquid biopsy only EGFR popped out as a good target.  Two drugs aim at that gene but aren’t approved for her type of cancer. A tumor board advised trying both — Erbitux and Tarceva, the drug her husband also had taken. Within two weeks, she quit using pain medicines. After two months, her liver tumor had shrunk roughly by half. There are signs that cancer may remain, but it is under control. She feels well enough to travel and to take care of her granddaughter.  “I’m very, very grateful to have a targeted therapy,” Cairnes said.  “I cannot expect a better outcome than what we’re seeing right now,” said her doctor, Shumei Kato.  WHAT STUDIES SHOW  But is gene-guided treatment better than usual care? French doctors did the first big test, with disappointing results. About 200 patients with advanced cancer were given whatever their doctors thought best or off-label drugs based on tumor profiling. Survival was similar — about two months.  Another French study, reported in June, was slightly more encouraging on survival but exposed another problem: No drugs exist for many gene flaws. Tests found treatable mutations in half of the 2,000 participants and only 143 got what a tumor board suggested.  Some doctors worry that tumor boards’ recommending off-label treatments diverts patients from research that would benefit all cancer patients. For example, the American Society of Clinical Oncology’s TAPUR study tests off-label drugs and shares results with their makers and federal regulators.  LETTING PATIENTS CHOOSE  Ann Meffert, who lives on a dairy farm in Waunakee, Wisconsin, endured multiple standard treatments that didn’t defeat her bile duct cancer.  “She was going to be referred to hospice; there was not much we could do,” said Dr. Nataliya Uboha, who took the case to a tumor board at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The panel gave several options, including off-label treatment, and Meffert chose a study that matches patients to gene-targeting therapies and started on an experimental one last October.  “Two weeks in, I started feeling better,” she said, and when she saw test results, “I couldn’t believe the difference.”  Many lung spots disappeared and the liver tumor shrank 75 percent. She is not cured, though, and doctors are thinking about next steps. And that could involve a fresh look at her tumor genes.  ___  Marilynn Marchione can be followed at @MMarchioneAP  __  This Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

774,2193,10,18,2017,2017-10-18,Associated Press News,Ohio seeks technology ideas to solve national opioid crisis," Ohio launched an $8 million effort Wednesday to attract ideas for using technology to solve the national opioid addiction crisis that has touched scores of families, including that of Columbus mother Jacqueline Lewis, who said solutions can’t come too soon.  During a news conference announcing the Ohio Opioid Technology Challenge, Lewis detailed her 29-year-old son’s struggle with addiction to painkillers and heroin. She said she supports any effort that encourages understanding that addiction is a disease, not a choice.  “To me, what this is all about is the possibilities with this in educating and raising that awareness and seeing all the entities coming together. That is so necessary,” she said. “It’s like a village raising the children. You need that; you need everybody in the same boat.”  Ohio is pitching the challenge globally. It’s similar in its mission to an effort the NFL used to generate new ideas to diagnose and prevent concussions.  It was launched after Republican Ohio Gov. John Kasich used his State of the State speech this year to call on the state’s Third Frontier Commission to provide funding to help accelerate scientific and technological breakthroughs that could help solve the U.S. opioid problem. Ohio is among the hardest hit U.S. states.  Development Services Director David Goodman, who chairs the commission, said the challenge is exciting and original.  “This is a tool, an opportunity to have a forum with folks from all over the world, the billions of people that live on this planet who are aware of this and who have that light bulb go off in their head: ‘I have this idea, I’ve told people about it, I don’t know what to do with it,’” Goodman said. “Now you have a tool to use.”  The challenge will roll out in three phases: the idea, challenge and product stages.  The idea generation phase begins immediately and lasts through Dec. 15. It allows both technical and non-technical audiences — researchers, caregivers, entrepreneurs and civilians alike — to submit their unique concepts. Ideas are being accepted through a dedicated website established for the project.  Up to five ideas deemed to have the highest likelihood of leading to a solution to the opioid abuse and addition crisis that’s ravaged the nation will be selected for cash awards of $10,000. Forty runners-up — 20 civilians and 20 technical professionals or experts — will be entered into a drawing to win $500 cash prizes.  Winning ideas will be advanced during the second and third phases. Keith Jenkins, opioid programs director of the Third Frontier Commission, said $6.5 million will be invested during those phases to start. Corporations are being solicited to add additional money to the challenge.  NineSigma North America CEO Andy Zynga, whose firm was selected to run the challenge, said such contests are known to encourage ideas across industries.  He said the Head Health Challenge launched by the NFL, GE and Under Armour generated some 1,000 ideas that included new helmet safety technologies developed from plastics and medical devices resembling “tricorders like on Star Trek” that could scan for brain injuries.  “Who knows? There may be a technology from food and beverage that has high-impact polymers that can be used for something like this,” he said. “Breakthroughs are shown to happen when you have technologies from other domains that are applied in different ways in the innovators’ domain.”",4.375,4,"[4.0, 4.5, 4.0, 5.0]"

The U.S. Energy Department announced Tuesday, Oct. 17, 2017, that the work to carve out more disposal space from the ancient salt formation where the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant is located will begin later this fall. The work should be done in 2020. (David X. Tejada/U.S. Department of Energy via AP)  ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — Workers are expected to begin mining operations at the U.S. nuclear waste dump in New Mexico for the first time in three years following a radiation release that contaminated part of the underground repository, the Energy Department said Tuesday.  The work to carve out more disposal space from the ancient salt formation where the repository is located will begin later this fall and should be completed by 2020, the department said in a statement.  Workers will remove more than 112,000 tons (101,605 metric tons) of salt, making way for seven disposal rooms. Each will have space for more than 10,000 drums containing up to 55 gallons (208 liters) of waste.  The repository, named the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, began accepting shipments of radioactive waste from defense sites and national laboratories earlier this year after being closed for nearly three years.  It’s working to catch up with the nation’s multibillion-dollar program for cleaning up tons of waste left behind by decades of bomb-making and nuclear research. The waste includes radioactive tools, gloves, clothing and other debris.  The pace of shipments is increasing slowly, but federal auditors recently raised concerns that the repository could run out of space. The U.S. Government Accountability Office also found that the Energy Department has no plans for securing regulatory approvals and expanding the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant before it reaches capacity in less than a decade.  Mining for the new disposal area first began in 2013 but was halted after the radiation release in February 2014.  A chemical reaction inside a barrel of waste that was inappropriately packed at Los Alamos National Laboratory before being shipped to the southern New Mexico repository was blamed for the radiation release.  Twenty-two workers at the repository were exposed, and monitors at the surface recorded low levels of radiological contamination. Officials maintained that nearby communities were not at risk.  The incident resulted in a $74 million settlement with the state of New Mexico for numerous permit violations at both the lab and the repository. Investigators said the misstep could have been avoided if existing policies and procedures had been followed.  The settlement, signed in early 2016, was at the time the largest ever negotiated between a state and the Energy Department.  Since then, some areas of the repository have remained off-limits, making it impossible for crews to do maintenance to prevent its ever-shifting salt ceilings and walls from collapsing.  In one area, monitors last month picked up on increased movement, indicating some instability. A rock fall last November forced a brief evacuation of workers but there were no injuries or contamination.  As the mining work resumes, officials said crews will install rock bolts to provide stability inside the new disposal vault.  A machine called a continuous miner removes the salt. It’s loaded into a large truck and then a hoist that carries the material nearly a half-mile (0.8 kilometers) to the surface.",3.8333333333333335,12,"[5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 0.5, 4.5, 4.0]"
779,2208,10,18,2017,2017-10-18,Associated Press News,"Under fire, Trump defends call to soldier’s grieving family"," President Donald Trump emphatically rejected claims Wednesday that he was disrespectful to the grieving family of a slain soldier, as the firestorm he ignited over his assertions of empathy for American service members spread into a third contentious day. “I have proof,” he insisted.  The controversy over how Trump has conducted one of the most sacred of presidential tasks generated new turmoil in the White House. After one slain soldier’s father accused the president of going back on a promise to send a check for $25,000, the White House said the money had been sent.  Chief of staff John Kelly, a retired Marine general whose son was killed in Afghanistan, was left angry and frustrated at the way the issue has become politicized. The dispute was fresh evidence of Trump’s willingness to attack any critic and do battle over the most sensitive of matters — and critics’ readiness to find fault with his words.  The aunt of an Army sergeant killed in Niger, who raised the soldier as her son, said Wednesday that Trump had shown “disrespect” to the soldier’s loved ones as he telephoned them to extend condolences as they drove to the Miami airport to receive his body. Sgt. La David Johnson was one of four American soldiers killed nearly two weeks ago; Trump called the families on Tuesday.  President Donald Trump strongly disputed a Florida congresswoman's account that the commander in chief told the widow of a soldier killed in an ambush in Niger that her husband ""knew what he signed up for."" (Oct. 18)  Rep. Frederica Wilson, a Florida Democrat who was in the car with Johnson’s family, said in an interview that Trump had told the widow that “you know that this could happen when you signed up for it ... but it still hurts.” He also referred to Johnson as “your guy,” Wilson said, which the congresswoman found insensitive.  Cowanda Jones-Johnson, who raised the soldier from age 5 after his mother died, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the Democratic congresswoman’s account was correct.  “Yes the statement is true,” she said. “I was in the car and I heard the full conversation.  At the airport, widow Myeshia Johnson leaned in grief across the flag-draped coffin after a military guard received it.  “She was crying for the whole time,” Wilson said. “And the worst part of it: When he hung up you know what she turned to me and said? She said he didn’t even remember his name.”  Trump started the storm this week when he claimed that he alone of U.S. presidents had called the families of all slain soldiers.  AP found relatives of four soldiers who died overseas during Trump’s presidency who said they never received calls from him. Relatives of three also said they did not get letters.  Obama and George W. Bush — saddled with far more combat casualties than the roughly two dozen so far under Trump — did not call all those soldiers’ families, either, but both did take steps to write, call or meet bereaved military families.  Chris Baldridge, the father of Army Cpl. Dillon Baldridge who was killed in June in Afghanistan, told The Washington Post that when Trump called him, he offered him $25,000 and said he would direct his staff to establish an online fundraiser for the family. But Baldridge said it didn’t happen.  The White House said Wednesday that a check has been sent. And Trump spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said it was “disgusting” that the news media were casting his “generous and sincere gesture” in a negative light.  White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said protocol requires that the Pentagon and White House Military Office prepare and confirm an information packet before the president contacts grieving family members, a process that can take weeks. She said Trump has made some form of contact with every family for whom he has received the appropriate information.  Trump, who tangled with a Gold Star family during last year’s presidential campaign, fiercely denied Rep. Wilson’s version of events. He declared on Twitter: “Democrat Congresswoman totally fabricated what I said to the wife of a soldier who died in action (and I have proof). Sad!”  He later insisted that he “didn’t say what that congresswoman said, didn’t say it at all. She knows it.”  Democrat Congresswoman totally fabricated what I said to the wife of a soldier who died in action (and I have proof). Sad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2017  In private, he bitterly complained to associates about the flare-up, believing the press was eager to paint his response in a negative light, according to two people who recently spoke to him but were not authorized to comment publicly about private conversations. His anger was echoed from the White House briefing room podium by Sanders, who said she was “appalled” by what she described as Wilson’s efforts to politicize the tragedy.  “Just because the president said ‘your guy’ doesn’t mean he doesn’t know his name,” said Sanders. She added that while no recordings of the conversation existed, several senior officials, including Kelly, witnessed the call and described Trump’s manner as “respectful” and “very sympathetic.”  Wilson did not back down from her account.  Like presidents before him, Trump has made personal contact with some families of the fallen but not all. What’s different is that Trump, alone among them, has suggested he’s done a better job of honoring the war dead and their families. He said Tuesday: “I think I’ve called every family of someone who’s died” while suggesting past presidents had not.  Trump’s delay in publicly discussing the lives lost in Niger does not appear to be unusual, judging from past examples, but his comments are. He went so far Tuesday as to cite the death of Kelly’s son to question whether Obama had properly honored the war dead.  Kelly was a Marine general under Obama when his Marine son Robert died in 2010. “You could ask General Kelly, did he get a call from Obama?” Trump said on Fox News radio.  Sanders said Obama did not call Kelly but it was not clear if some other form of contact was made. She added that Kelly was “disgusted” the condolence calls had been politicized but said she was not certain if the chief of staff knew Trump was going to talk about his son publicly.  Two White House officials said Kelly was also frustrated that the controversy had distracted from a significant military win over the Islamic State in Raqqa, Syria.  Former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, who led the Pentagon for a portion of the time Kelly served as commander of U.S. Southern Command, was bitterly critical of Trump’s comments.  “If there is one sacred ground in politics it should be the ultimate sacrifices made by our military,” Hagel wrote in an email to the AP. “To use General Kelly and his family in this disgusting political way is sickening and beneath every shred of decency of presidential leadership. Beyond the dignity of the office.”  Johnson was one of four soldiers killed in an ambush by dozens of Islamic extremists during a joint patrol by American and Niger forces, U.S. military officials say.  ___  Lemire reported from New York.

780,2209,10,18,2017,2017-10-18,Associated Press News,"Sessions defends Comey firing, dodges questions on Trump"," Attorney General Jeff Sessions strongly defended President Donald Trump’s firing of James Comey, but at a Senate hearing Wednesday repeatedly declined to discuss private conversations with the president about the dismissal, frustrating Democratic lawmakers who wanted to link the firing of the FBI director to a broader inquiry into Russian election meddling.  The repeated, often-testy questioning about the Russia investigation, coming even as Sessions spearheads sweeping changes to the Justice Department in the areas of LGBT rights, criminal justice and immigration, illustrates the extent to which the probe continues to shadow Sessions even though he recused himself months ago.  Sessions advised the Senate Judiciary Committee at the outset of his first oversight hearing as attorney general that he would not answer any questions about conversations with the president that he considered confidential.  He largely adhered to that principle during the five-hour hearing, refusing to say what Trump told him about his reasons for wanting to fire Comey, whether Trump confided in him his concern about “lifting the cloud” of the Russia investigation and whether he had asked him to drop a criminal case against Sheriff Joe Arpaio in Arizona.  Democratic Sen. Al Franken is accusing Attorney General Jeff Sessions of ""moving the goalposts"" in denying his interactions with the Russian ambassador. (Oct. 18)  Sessions deflected the questions by maintaining that presidents are entitled to have private discussions with Cabinet secretaries, saying at one point, “I do not confirm or deny the existence of any communication between the president that I consider to be confidential.”  Still, Sessions’ defense of the Comey firing — and his insistence that it stemmed from the handling of the Hillary Clinton email case — was consistent with the initial explanation by the White House. It was, he said, “the first time I’m aware of” in which an FBI director had performed the traditional role of Justice Department prosecutors by announcing on his own the conclusion of a federal investigation — that no charges would be brought against Clinton.  He said he was further galled when Comey, shortly before his firing, insisted to Congress that he would have taken the same actions again.  “That was a fairly stunning event for both of us and it did highlight the problem more significantly than it had been before,” Sessions said, referring to Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein.  Though he refused to say whether he discussed with Trump Comey’s involvement in the Russia investigation, he did say that the president had asked him and Rosenstein for their recommendations about what to do with Comey.  But that explanation has been muddled by Trump himself, who days after the May 9 firing said he would have fired Comey even without the Justice Department’s recommendation and that he was thinking of “this Russia thing” when he dismissed him.  The circumstances of Comey’s firing are among many events being investigated by Robert Mueller, who was appointed as the Justice Department’s special counsel to look into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to influence the outcome of the 2016 election.  After initially balking at the question, Sessions said Mueller’s team had not interviewed him as part of its investigation.  The hearing marked a return to the Judiciary Committee for Sessions, who served on it for years as a Republican senator. Yet his interactions with his former peers have been frayed as attorney general, particularly amid Democratic accusations that he provided misleading testimony at his confirmation hearing about his contacts with the Russian ambassador.  He bickered with Sen. Al Franken, a Minnesota Democrat, who accused him of having moved the “goalpost” in his denials about his contacts with the ambassador.  He said that while Sessions had initially denied having any contacts with Russians during the campaign, he later qualified his answer to say that he had not discussed any matters related to the campaign. Sessions repeated Wednesday that he had done nothing improper and had given a “good-faith” response.  Apart from Russia, Sessions faced questions from lawmakers about his swift undoing of Obama-era protections for gay and transgender people and his rollback of criminal justice policies that aimed to reduce the federal prison population, among other changes he has made in the nine months since taking office.  Franken praised his decision to send an experienced federal hate crimes prosecutor to assist in a transgender murder case in Iowa, but said his Justice Department has “demonstrated an unrelenting hostility toward LGBT people,” an assertion Sessions disputed.  Sessions has tried to pressure so-called sanctuary cities into cooperating with federal immigration authorities by threatening to withhold grant money, and he was the public face of the Trump administration’s decision to end a program benefiting hundreds of thousands of young people who entered the U.S. illegally as children. Congress is seeking a legislative solution to extend the protections before recipients’ work permits expire.  He tussled with Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois over whether people living in the country illegally are driving Chicago’s gun violence. The city has been in the Trump administration’s crosshairs for refusing to help immigration authorities detain and deport immigrants. Durbin said he wanted Chicago officers doing community policing and not immigration work.  “How does that make the city of Chicago safer when you don’t remove criminals who are illegally in the country?” Sessions said.  It is standard policy for attorneys general to appear before the Justice Department’s congressional overseers on the House and Senate judiciary committees.  Yet, in a reflection of the extent to which the Russia investigation and his own role as a Trump campaign ally have dominated public attention, Sessions first appeared months ago before the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is conducting its own probe of election meddling.",3.357142857142857,21,"[3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 2.5, 0.5, 5.0, 3.5, 0.5, 4.5, 2.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.5, 0.5, 2.5, 1.5, 3.5]"

Sen. Alexander says Trump called him Wednesday morning ""to be encouraging"" of bipartisan efforts to come up with a plan to stabilize health insurance premiums. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)  WASHINGTON (AP) — The authors of a bipartisan plan to calm health insurance markets said Wednesday they’ll push the proposal forward, even as President Donald Trump’s stance ricocheted from supportive to disdainful to arm’s-length and the plan’s fate teetered.  “If something can happen, that’s fine,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “But I won’t do anything to enrich the insurance companies because right now the insurance companies are being enriched. They’ve been enriched by Obamacare like nothing anybody has ever seen before.”  The agreement by Sens. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Patty Murray, D-Wash., on a two-year extension of federal subsidies to insurers that Trump has blocked gained an important new foe. The anti-abortion National Right to Life said it opposed the measure because it lacked language barring people from using their federally subsidized coverage to buy policies covering abortion, said Jennifer Popik, the group’s top lobbyist.  In another blow, Doug Andres, spokesman for House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said Ryan “does not see anything that changes his view that the Senate should keep its focus on repeal and replace of Obamacare.” With hard-right conservatives wielding considerable influence and unwilling to prop up President Barack Obama’s health care law, it was unclear if Ryan would be willing to even bring the measure to his chamber’s floor.  President Donald Trump is expressing support for an agreement struck by two leading lawmakers to extend federal payments to health insurers. (Oct. 17)  Overall, it was a bad day for the bipartisan accord, with several Republicans conceding that it likely needed Trump’s backing to survive.  “Without the president supporting it, I don’t think you have the votes in the House or the Senate,” No. 3 Senate GOP leader John Thune of South Dakota told reporters, adding, “We’re stalled out.”  Alexander and Murray shook hands on their agreement this week after months of intermittent talks. Failure to restore the federal payments to insurers could result in higher premiums for millions buying their own individual policies and drive carriers from unprofitable markets. Many in Congress would love to avoid blame for two such tumultuous events.  The compromise has won warm endorsements from Democrats and some Republicans. It includes steps won by Republicans to make it easier for insurers to avoid some coverage requirements under Obama’s 2010 overhaul.  But Trump has lambasted the subsidies as insurance company bailouts.  “It’s not a full approach and we need something to go a little further,” said White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders.  The money reimburses carriers for lowering co-payments and deductibles for about 6 million lower-income customers, which the companies must do under Obama’s statute.  Without those funds, insurers would likely boost premiums by an average 20 percent, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has projected. This would especially hit many buying their own health insurance who make too much to qualify for tax credits that help reduce premiums for lower earners.  Confusingly, Trump praised the bipartisan agreement early Tuesday as a “very good solution,” only to berate it in an evening speech. Some said his objections Wednesday to enriching insurers could be addressed by strengthening language in the compromise to ensure the money directly benefits customers, not companies.  “We will keep working on it,” said Alexander. He said he and Murray would formally unveil the bill Thursday and predicted that “some form of the proposal” would become law by year’s end. It could become part of a must-pass bill preventing a federal shutdown due in December.  “The president has had six positions on our bill,” Murray told reporters. Asked if the measure was still alive, she said, “Of course it is.”  Alexander said Trump called him Wednesday morning and encouraged him to continue his effort, but left wiggle room.  “I may want to add something to it,” Alexander said in a brief interview with The Associated Press, describing what Trump told him about the deal. “And it may have to be part of a larger negotiation.”  Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, criticized the plan, saying: “It would last two years and spend a whopping amount of money and not solve the problem and lead us down a path of never getting the problem done.” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has been non-committal.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said to address Trump’s aversion to enriching insurers, Democrats had offered to delay the measure’s impact for a month after enactment to let insurers lower premiums after payments were restored. Insurers in some states have installed higher premiums for next year, anticipating the subsidies would end. Schumer said White House officials rejected that idea.  GOP co-sponsors include Sens. John McCain of Arizona, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Tennessee’s Bob Corker. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said Alexander has eight or nine Republican co-sponsors, and Democrats plan to provide an equal number to build bipartisan pressure.  Also behind the measure were America’s Health Insurance Plans, the giant trade group for insurers; AARP representing the elderly; the National Retail Federation, which lobbies for merchants plus doctors, hospitals and patients groups.  ___  AP Congressional Correspondent Erica Werner and reporters Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, Ken Thomas, Kevin Freking and Jill Colvin contributed.",3.25,8,"[4.0, 5.0, 0.5, 4.5, 4.5, 3.5, 1.5, 2.5]"

Alaska Natural Resources Commissioner Andy Mack says oil production on gravel islands in state waters show that the Liberty Project can be done safely. Opponents say spills are inevitable and Arctic offshore oil should stay in the ground. (Hilcorp Alaska Inc. via AP)  ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — America within a few years could be extracting oil from federal waters in the Arctic Ocean, but it won’t be from a remote drilling platform.  Federal regulators are taking comments on a draft environmental statement for the Liberty Project, a proposal by a subsidiary of Houston-based Hilcorp to create an artificial gravel island that would hold production wells, a processing facility and the start of an undersea pipeline carrying oil to shore and connections to the trans-Alaska pipeline.  The drilling would be the first in federal Arctic waters since Royal Dutch Shell, amid protest both in the United States and abroad, in 2015 sent down an exploratory well in the Chukchi Sea off Alaska’s northwest coast.  Supporters like its chances. A final decision is in the hands of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. President Barak Obama in December signed an executive order designating the bulk of U.S. Arctic Ocean waters indefinitely off-limits to future oil and gas leasing. But President Donald in April signed another order aimed at reversing the policy. Zinke said Trump’s actions would put the country on track for energy independence.  Opponents say Arctic offshore oil should stay in the ground, where it won’t add greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming and the melting of sea ice, the habitat of polar bears and walruses. They say spills are inevitable and cannot be cleaned up in icy Arctic water.  Opponents also question Hilcorp’s safety record. State authorities this year fined the company $200,000 for violations at another production site. Hilcorp also waited several months to address an undersea pipeline leaking millions of cubic feet of processed natural gas in Alaska’s Cook Inlet because of danger to divers, Lois Epstein, Arctic program director for The Wilderness Society, said at an Anchorage hearing.  “This ongoing gas release into Cook Inlet, visible from the air, was a national embarrassment for Alaska,” she said.  The gas leaked from a pipeline supplying fuel to Hilcorp production platforms. The company confirmed the leak in February and lowered pressure in the line but waited until April to make repairs because of the threat to divers from floating ice. The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation to date has found no evidence the leak harmed birds, fish or marine mammals.  The latest project is on federal leases sold in the 1990s. Hilcorp proposes to create the island about 15 miles (24 kilometers) east of Prudhoe Bay, North America’s largest oil field. BP Exploration Alaska drilled at the site in 1997 and sold 50 percent of the assets to Hilcorp in 2014.  The island’s base on the ocean floor would be 24 acres, about the size of 18 football fields, with sloped sides leading to a work surface of 9 acres, the size of nearly seven football fields.  Trucks would travel by ice road to a hole cut in sea ice and deposit 83,000 cubic yards (63,450 million cubic meters) of gravel into 19 feet (6 meters) of water to create the island. A wall would fend off ice, waves and wildlife.  The island would be 5.6 miles (9 kilometers) off shore. The surface would have room for 16 wells, including five to eight conventional production wells. At peak production, Hilcorp anticipates extracting 60,000 to 70,000 barrels per day for a total recovery of 80 million to 150 million barrels over 15 to 20 years.  Oil would reach shore by a pipe encased by a second pipe and equipped with a leak detection systems. It would be buried to prevent gouging by moving ice.  At the end of production, the company would remove equipment and the wall and let waves and ice dismantle the island.  At a public hearing on the project last week, Joshua Kendrick, an attorney for the Alaska Oil and Gas Association, said opposition testimony has focused on rhetoric. Liberty would be the 19th artificial drilling island in Alaska, including four now pumping oil from state waters. Decisions should be made by data and science, he said, and Hilcorp is not proposing something novel.  “This isn’t venturing into new waters. Anyone who sells fear or the least likely outcome to discourage these types of investments coming forward is doing a disservice to Alaska, doing a disservice to the public,” he said.  Andy Mack, commissioner of the state Department of Natural Resources, said the body of information built up from wells on gravel islands in state waters should give people comfort about Liberty’s effects on marine mammals and the environment. Like other supporters, he touted Liberty’s economic benefits.  “Each of these facilities on its own, frankly, they’re not giant fields,” Mack said. “But they’re all very, very important to the economy of Alaska.”  Blake Upshaw of the Center for Biological Diversity said spills are inevitable and routine and cannot be cleaned up in Arctic waters.  “Oil companies have guaranteed safe operations to communities in Valdez, the Gulf of Mexico and Santa Barbara over the years, and we all know how projects in those locations turned out,” he said.

The conflicting goals raise concerns that leaders might put off changes needed to reinvigorate a cooling economy that faces surging debt and trade tensions with Washington and Europe. (AP Photo/Andy Wong, File)  BEIJING (AP) — China’s ruling Communist Party is expanding its role in business even as it promises freer markets and support for entrepreneurs on the eve of President Xi Jinping’s second five-year term as leader.  Party officials are tightening their control over state-owned enterprises and want a voice in how some foreign companies are run. State companies that dominate energy and other fields are being made even bigger through mergers. Some are forming ties with private sector success stories such as tech giants Alibaba and Tencent to draw on their skills.  Beijing’s conflicting goals are raising concerns that leaders might put off changes needed to reinvigorate a cooling economy that faces surging debt and trade tensions with Washington and Europe.  “There is no grand vision. There are parallel goals that are competing with each other,” said Andrew Polk, an economist at Trivium/China, a research firm in Beijing. “We are not sure which ones are going to win out at a given moment.”  No major policy changes are expected out of the twice-a-decade party congress that is due to re-appoint Xi as general secretary. The party also will name a Standing Committee, the country’s ruling inner circle of power, in preparation for installing a new government in early 2018.  The impact of those choices, by creating jobs and business opportunities or dragging on economic activity, will take time to filter down to ordinary Chinese.  At the opening of the congress Wednesday, Xi repeated official promises to support entrepreneurs and give market forces a “decisive role” but affirmed the dominance of state-owned industry.  “There must be no irresolution about working to consolidate and develop the public sector,” said Xi in a nationally televised address.  Data released Thursday showed economic growth stayed relatively stable in the quarter ending in September, buoyed by strength in consumer spending and exports. Output rose 6.8 percent, down marginally from the previous quarter’s 6.9 percent.  Investors are watching the congress for signs of where the party wants to go and how fast. A key indicator will be which posts go to Xi allies seen as reformers with the personal authority to overcome opposition from party or state industry factions that might lose influence.  One closely watched figure is Wang Qishan, a vice premier and respected problem-solver who oversaw China’s response to SARS and at age 69 is obliged by party tradition to leave the seven-person Standing Committee. If he stays in a leadership post, analysts say that would suggest Xi wants his help to carry out painful changes.  Reform advocates complain that since Xi took power in 2012, the leadership has dragged its feet on fulfilling promises to tackle debt that has soared to dangerous levels, curb the dominance of state industry and give a bigger role to entrepreneurs who create China’s new jobs and wealth.  Instead, Xi focused on an anti-corruption campaign and tightened political control, detained activist lawyers and stepped up internet censorship.  Foreign industry groups complain China is moving too slowly on promises to shrink state-owned steel and aluminum producers they accuse of threatening jobs by flooding global markets with low-cost exports.  “Generally speaking, there has been no major progress in economic reform,” said Sheng Hong, director of the Unirule Institute, an independent economic research group in Beijing.  Regulators closed Unirule’s website and social media accounts in a crackdown in January on liberal voices.  The party’s internal conflict is reflected in a 2013 declaration that promised for the first time to give market forces the “decisive role” but also vowed the party would intensify its control of state industry. Private sector analysts say this appears to be aimed at rooting out corruption and waste.  This year, some foreign companies say the party, which already has cells in all enterprises and controls agencies that regulate them, is trying to expand its authority further by asking for a formal voice in commercial decisions.  Some 32 mainland companies with shares traded in Hong Kong have proposed changes to their legal structure to make the party an adviser to their board. Financial commentators complain this might hurt shareholders.  “This is potentially a huge problem,” said the German ambassador to China, Michael Clauss. “Many foreign companies are very alarmed.”  Foreign companies already are frustrated by rules that give them little access to industries such as finance and technology, plans they say might limit their role in promising fields such as electric cars. That pessimism helped lead to a 1.2 percent decline in investment into China in the first seven months of this year, breaking a series of annual double-digit gains.  A business leader in Wenzhou, a southeastern city known as a hotbed of private sector activity, welcomed Xi’s pledge to do more to help entrepreneurs.  “If private enterprises succeed, China’s economy succeeds,” said Zhou Dewen, president of the city’s Association for Promotion of Development of Small and Medium-sized Companies.  Beijing is pushing entrepreneurs to support state-owned enterprises, or SOEs.  The party pledged in a Sept. 25 declaration to promote “entrepreneurial spirit” while also urging entrepreneurs to learn “socialist core values.”  In August, one of the country’s three major state-owned phone carriers, China Unicom Ltd., sold an $11.7 billion stake to private investors including Alibaba Group, the biggest global e-commerce company by sales volume; Tencent Holdings Ltd., which operates the popular WeChat social media platform, and internet search giant Baidu Inc. There was no indication they would get any voice in management.  In September, Tencent paid $366 million for 5 percent of state-owned investment bank China International Capital Corp. CICC gets access to Tencent’s marketing and other skills, but the private company gained no management control.  Other state companies have announced similar plans to bring in private shareholders.  Meanwhile, authorities are discussing taking a direct state ownership stake in Alibaba and Tencent, The Wall Street Journal reported this month, citing unidentified sources.  “Supposed reforms in state-own companies such as ‘mixed ownership’ can never be called a reform,” said Sheng. “Setting up party committees in companies not only is not a reform, but is a step backward.”  In August, the government announced the merger of Shenhua Group, the world’s biggest coal producer, and Guodian Group, a major power supplier, to form the world’s biggest utility by assets.  “They are being quite clear that they want bigger, bolder, better SOEs, with not just state but party leadership,” said Polk.  The pressure for action is building.  Economic growth has been propped up this year by a lending boom and government stimulus, but that sets back official efforts to build a consumer-driven economy.  Forecasters expect growth to cool as regulators tighten lending controls to rein in debt that has risen to the equivalent of 260 percent of annual economic output — unusually high for a developing country.  “Strains within the country’s banking sector are already glaringly evident,” the Economist Intelligence Unit said in a report.  ___  AP researcher Yu Bing contributed.",3.1145833333333335,48,"[4.0, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.0, 1.5, 3.5, 5.0, 1.5, 5.0, 4.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 2.5, 0.5, 2.5, 3.5, 2.0, 5.0, 1.5, 5.0, 2.5, 3.5, 0.5, 3.5, 4.5, 0.5, 2.5, 3.0, 5.0, 3.0, 0.5, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 3.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 2.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.5, 1.0]"

United Continental Holdings, Inc. reports earnings Wednesday, Oct. 18, 2017. (AP Photo/David J. Phillip, File)  DALLAS (AP) — Shares of United Airlines dropped more than 12 percent on Thursday — their biggest one-day percentage decline in eight years — after a contentious conference call that caused analysts to question whether United executives are making progress on their turnaround plan.  Analysts speculated whether a management shakeup could be coming.  United had already signaled that weak pricing will continue for the rest of this year. On the call, several analysts pressed management for evidence that the company is doing enough to raise revenue and control costs.  CEO Oscar Munoz appealed for patience. He said United “dug ourselves in a hole” compared to competitors, and that his management team is working on a plan for long-term success.  “It’s a difficult period for us as we work through all this information,” Munoz said. “The team has only been in place really for a year and we’re just getting our mojo working ... I just need a little more time.”  Munoz was named CEO in September 2015. He cemented his executive lineup by hiring former American Airlines president Scott Kirby for the same job at United in August 2016.  United executives claimed Thursday that measures they spelled out at an investor day last year to raise revenue and cut spending were going well, but they declined to give specifics or back away from expansion plans.  Barclays analyst Brandon Oglenski was especially pointed in his criticism, telling Munoz that the CEO should know that when a company makes public statements about financial targets, investors will want to measure it against those numbers. He said United’s earnings, margins and stock price were doing worse in 2017 than those of key rivals.  Shares of United Continental Holdings Inc. tumbled $8.21, or 12.1 percent, to close at $59.78. It was the biggest one-day drop ever in price, and the biggest percentage decline since October 2009. The shares have dropped 18 percent this year, while shares of American, Delta and Southwest airlines have gained between 6 and 18 percent.  Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi said Thursday’s sell-off reflected “an erosion in confidence of management.” He said the top question he heard from investors was whether this could be “a catalyst for management change.”  “Clearly, patience with executing the turnaround at United is wearing thin with investors,” DeNardi wrote in a note to clients.  Cowen and Co. analyst Helane Becker said there had been “rumblings” from investors about another shakeup at United before the call, but afterward “they aren’t rumblings, but full-fledged screams.”  The prickly call came a day after United reported that third-quarter profit fell by one-third to $637 million as hurricanes led to 8,300 canceled flights and $210 million in lost revenue. A key measure of pricing power fell 3.7 percent, and the Chicago-based airline forecast it will drop by 1 percent to 3 percent in the fourth quarter.  Analysts said the fourth-quarter forecast wasn’t so bad, but raised doubts about recent business initiatives.  “People are beginning to wonder, is the strategy working?” Stephens Inc. analyst Jack Atkins said in an interview. “When will we see that materialize in the financials?”  United is on pace to increase domestic passenger-carrying capacity by more than 4 percent this year. Atkins said that is too fast and undermines pricing power, and that United is simultaneously seeing a “really troubling” increase in costs.  ___  David Koenig can be reached at http://twitter.com/airlinewriter",3.3132530120481927,83,"[2.5, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.0, 2.5, 1.5, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.0, 4.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.0, 1.5, 1.5, 0.5, 2.5, 2.5, 4.5, 2.5, 5.0, 3.5, 3.0, 3.5, 3.0, 2.5, 3.5, 4.0, 2.5, 2.0, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 4.0, 0.5, 4.0, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 2.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 2.5, 4.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 2.5, 1.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 0.5, 1.0, 3.5, 4.0, 5.0, 2.5, 3.0, 2.5, 5.0, 4.5]"

On Wednesday, Oct. 18, 2017, the Food and Drug Administration approved sales of the therapy Yescarta, developed by Kite Pharma. It is the second gene therapy for U.S. patients _ the first one for adults _ a custom-made, one-time treatment for certain common types of the blood cancer lymphoma. (Kite Pharma via AP, File)  TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — U.S. regulators on Wednesday approved a second gene therapy for a blood cancer, a one-time, custom-made treatment for aggressive lymphoma in adults.  The Food and Drug Administration allowed sales of the treatment from Kite Pharma. It uses the same technology, called CAR-T, as the first gene therapy approved in the U.S. in August, a treatment for childhood leukemia from Novartis Pharmaceuticals.  “In just several decades, gene therapy has gone from being a promising concept to a practical solution to deadly and largely untreatable forms of cancer,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in a statement.  The treatment, called Yescarta, will cost $373,000 per patient, according to drugmaker Gilead Sciences. Kite became a subsidiary of Foster City, California-based Gilead this month.  CAR-T treatment uses gene therapy techniques not to fix disease-causing genes but to turbocharge T cells, immune system soldiers that cancer can often evade. The T cells are filtered from a patient’s blood, reprogrammed to target and kill cancer cells, and then hundreds of millions of copies are grown.  Returned to the patient, all the revved-up cells can continue multiplying to fight disease for months or years. That’s why these immunotherapy treatments are called “living drugs.”  “Today’s approval of Yescarta is a very significant advance for lymphoma patients and for the cancer community as a whole,” Louis J. DeGennaro, president of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, said in a statement. “Immunotherapy is dramatically changing the way we approach blood cancer treatment.”  Kite’s therapy is for patients with three types of aggressive, or fast-growing, large B-cell lymphoma. The most common one accounts for about a third of the estimated 72,000 new cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosed each year.  Yescarta, also known as axicabtagene ciloleucel, was approved for patients who have already been treated with at least two cancer drugs that either didn’t work for them or eventually stopped working.  At that point, patients are generally out of options and only have about a 10 percent chance of even temporary remission of their cancer, said Dr. Frederick Locke, director of research for the Immune Cell Therapy Program at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida. Locke helped run patient tests of Yescarta.  “This is really an exciting advance for patients without hope,” Locke said.  Yescarta is not a benign treatment, though: Three people died after getting the treatment, which can cause serious side effects. The FDA is requiring Kite to do a long-term safety study and train hospitals to quickly spot and handle those reactions.  In the key test, Yescarta was given to 101 patients. About 72 percent saw their cancer shrink and about half showed no sign of disease eight months later.  While it is billed as a one-time treatment, because the patients’ cancer is so far advanced, it returns in some. The therapy is still working in most study participants, so the average duration of its effects isn’t known yet.  A different type of gene therapy is waiting in the wings at the FDA.

Comments at a packed public hearing this week were overwhelmingly critical of state revisions to a set of standards developed by a consortium of states and the National Academy of Sciences.  The Public Education Department indicated that final standards will restore references to the 4.6 billion-year age of the Earth, the rise in global temperatures over the past century and the process of evolution due to genetic variation.  “We have listened to the thoughtful input received and will incorporate many of the suggestions into the New Mexico standards,” Public Education Secretary Christopher Ruszkowski said in a statement.  A complete version of the revised final standards is still being prepared and was not released.  Ruszkowski previously has defended the proposed standards as a way to give local families and teachers greater flexibility and local control around science materials, curriculum and content.  Major school districts, science teaching associations, leading scientists at a national weapons laboratory in New Mexico and others expressed fear that state revisions would short change students by leaving out fundamental components of earth sciences, global warming and genetics.  Scores of people at the public hearing urged the state to adopt an unedited version of Next Generation Science Standards.  Gregory Swift, a physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, said he was encouraged that the Public Education Department was redrafting the standards — though still cautious about the outcome.  “I’d like to see the whole set of changes,” he said. “To me this looks like a politician’s idea of a compromise by trying to give everybody something.

Some in the military community are furious that Trump has drawn John Kelly’s family tragedy into a political brawl. Trump this week suggested that President Barack Obama did not properly console Kelly’s family when his son, Robert, was killed in Afghanistan in 2010. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Enraged and rattled by the political brawl over military mourning, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly returned this week to the one place he could go clear his head — Section 60 of Arlington National Cemetery, some of the saddest ground in America. There, amid the memorials to the recent war dead is Grave 9480, the final resting place of Kelly’s son, Robert, a Marine killed in 2010 in Afghanistan.  “The only thing I could do to collect my thoughts was to go and walk among the finest men and women on this Earth,” Kelly told reporters Thursday, as he mounted a vigorous defense of President Donald Trump’s handling of the “sacred” job of consoling families of fallen soldiers.  Kelly’s remarks invoking his son and his personal grief was a startling shift for the reserved, retired Marine general who has largely recoiled at injecting his family’s loss into the political arena. Since the younger Kelly was killed by a land mine in remote Helmand province, his father has labored to keep Robert’s death out of the spotlight — no easy task as the highest ranking military official to lose a child in the wars. Kelly only occasionally references his son in remarks, often growing emotional as he recounts the heartbreaking events or is asked to describe Robert.  “Finest man I ever knew,” Kelly said on Fox & Friends in May.  On Memorial Day, he and Trump visited Robert’s grave at Arlington.  “We grieve with you. We honor you. And we pledge to you that we will always remember Robert and what he did for all of us,” Trump said, singling out the Kelly family during his remarks to the nation that day. Turning to Robert’s father, then the secretary of homeland security, Trump added, “Thank you, John.”  But Trump this week pushed Kelly into new terrain.  Seeking to defend his record of outreach to Gold Star families, Trump suggested former President Barack Obama should have called Kelly after Robert’s death but didn’t.  “You could ask Gen. Kelly, did he get a call from Obama?” Trump said in an interview on Fox News Radio.  Trump’s willingness to raise the tragedy set many in the military community seething.  “If there is one sacred ground in politics it should be the ultimate sacrifices made by our military,” wrote Chuck Hagel, a defense secretary under Obama and before that, a Republican U.S. senator. In an email to The Associated Press, Hagel added: “To use General Kelly and his family in this disgusting political way is sickening and beneath every shred of decency of presidential leadership.”  “I would be surprised if he comes in and starts allowing people to use his family as a tool,” said Charles C. Krulak, a former Marine Corps commandant who has known John Kelly since the mid-1990s.  The public controversy this week clearly was painful for Kelly, whose son had been awarded the Purple Heart. Kelly knew in 2010 that his son was patrolling with his men through mine-filled battlefields and had just days earlier warned the family of the potential danger, according to a report in The Washington Post. When Gen. Joseph Dunford Jr. rang the elder Kelly’s doorbell at 6:10 a.m. on November 9, 2010, John Kelly knew Robert was dead. Dunford, Kelly told reporters Thursday, said Robert “was where he wanted to be exactly, what he wanted to be with exactly the people he wanted to be with.”  “Hours after my son was killed his friends were calling us from Afghanistan telling us how great a guy he was. Those are the only phone calls that really matter,” Kelly said Thursday. But, he allowed, there’s “not really much that can take the edge off” such a loss.  In March 2011, Kelly accompanied his boss, Defense Secretary Bob Gates, on a visit to the Sangin district, in Helmand province — the scene of some of the most intense fighting of the war and where Robert Kelly had been killed.  As Gates’ senior military assistant, Kelly stood silently among young Marines gathering under a harsh sun as Gates applauded what they had accomplished.  “Your success, obviously, has come at an extraordinary price,” Gates said without mentioning names.  Asked to elaborate on Robert in the Fox interview, Kelly hesitated at first — then it came tumbling out.  “Finest guy. Wonderful guy. Wonderful husband, wonderful son, wonderful brother. Brave beyond all get out. His men still correspond with us. They still mourn him as we do.”  ___  Follow Kellman and Burns on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/APLaurieKellman and http://www.twitter.com/RobertBurnsAP .  ___  Associated Press writer Rhonda Shafner contributed to this report.",3.097560975609756,41,"[4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 2.5, 5.0, 3.0, 4.5, 2.0, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0, 1.5, 3.0, 3.0, 2.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 3.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 3.5, 2.5, 2.0, 0.5, 4.5, 4.5, 2.5, 0.5, 3.5, 5.0, 0.5, 0.5, 3.0, 3.0, 4.5, 2.5]"
824,2275,10,19,2017,2017-10-19,Associated Press News,Judge won’t throw out ruling explaining Arpaio’s conviction," The judge in former Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s now-pardoned criminal case has refused the retired lawman’s request to throw out all rulings in the case, including a blistering decision that explained her reasoning in finding him guilty of a crime.  The request denied Thursday by U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton was aimed at clearing Arpaio’s name and barring the ruling’s use in future court cases as an example of a prior bad act.  Bolton said pardons don’t erase convictions or the facts of cases. She said the pardon issued by President Donald Trump only mooted Arpaio’s possible punishments.  “The pardon undoubtedly spared defendant from any punishment that might otherwise have been imposed,” Bolton wrote. “It did not, however, ‘revise the historical facts’ of this case.”  Arpaio’s attorneys appealed Thursday’s decision to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.  The conviction stemmed from Arpaio’s disobedience of a 2011 court order that barred his traffic patrols that targeted immigrants. Prosecutors had accused Arpaio of prolonging the patrols for 17 months so that he could promote his immigration enforcement efforts in a bid to boost his successful 2012 re-election campaign.  Arpaio, who endorsed Trump and appeared alongside him at rallies during the 2016 campaign, has acknowledged prolonging the patrols, but insisted his disobedience wasn’t intentional and blamed one of his former attorneys for not adequately explaining the order’s importance.  Critics say the Aug. 25 pardon removed the last chance at holding Arpaio legally accountable for a long history of misconduct, including a 2013 civil verdict in which Arpaio’s officers were found to have racially profiled Latinos in the sheriff’s immigration patrols.  The sheriff’s defiance of the court order is believed to have contributed to his 2016 election loss after serving 24 years as metro Phoenix’s top law enforcer.  Several legal advocacy groups had requested that the pardon be declared invalid or unconstitutional, arguing that letting it stand would encourage future violations of court orders.  Earlier this month, Bolton ruled that the pardon will stand and dismissed the case.  ___  Follow Jacques Billeaud at twitter.com/jacquesbilleaud.

His rapid backpedal on a short-term health care fix this week is the latest example to leave Republicans and Democrats alike scratching their heads. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)  WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is proving to be an erratic negotiating partner as he punts policy issues to Congress and then sends conflicting signals about what he really wants.  His rapid backpedal this week on a short-term health care is the latest example, and it’s left Republicans and Democrats scratching their heads.  “The president has had six positions on our bill,” an exasperated Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said Wednesday after Trump offered multiple reads on a bipartisan plan to keep health insurance markets in business. Trump ultimately ended with a thumbs-down.  Nine months into office, Trump has shown a preference for delegating to lawmakers on everything from health care and immigration to foreign policy. Sometimes he creates situations that demand a congressional solution. In other cases, he sets difficult-to-achieve broad policy goals and expects lawmakers to fill in the fine print.  Along the way, he’s proved to be an unpredictable force. He encouraged Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., to work with Murray on a bipartisan solution on insurer payments, only to announce after some wavering that he wouldn’t support it.  Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin took Trump to task on Thursday, saying: “It’s always best for the president to be completely consistent in terms of what he’s supporting or not supporting. And let’s face it, he’s not been particularly consistent here.”  Trump was tweaking Congress again Thursday, calling a Senate GOP budget plan the “first step toward massive tax cuts” but suggesting there was uncertainty about the votes. “I think we have the votes, but who knows?” he tweeted.  Yet Republican leaders were moving forward with a degree of certainty as only one GOP senator, Rand Paul of Kentucky, has expressed opposition.  Despite controlling both chambers of Congress and the White House, Republicans have achieved no major legislative successes this year. Their efforts on health care have ended in failure, leaving tax overhaul legislation as their only hope for a major win.  Some Republicans have grown resentful, and they’re looking ahead to the 2018 elections with apprehension.  Most shy away from public criticism, arguing that the president is simply looking to Congress to do its job and pass legislation. If the work is piling up, they say, it’s because former President Barack Obama took executive steps that were actually in Congress’ domain, and now Trump needs congressional help to unwind them.  They point to immigration, where Obama acted unilaterally to extend protections to immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children, and the Iran nuclear deal, where Trump’s decision not to certify Tehran compliance kicks the future of U.S. participation to Congress.  “Look, our job is our job and it’s our responsibility, it’s our job to get this done,” said Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo. “I’m not going to try to lay the blame at somebody else.”  Trump doesn’t have any such hesitation.  “I have great relationships with actually many senators, but in particular with most Republican senators. But we’re not getting the job done,” the president said this week. “And I’m not going to blame myself, I’ll be honest. They are not getting the job done.”  Trump’s unpredictability makes it hard for lawmakers to keep up with his latest positions.  “I hadn’t heard that. I thought yesterday he was liking it,” Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., remarked in surprise on Wednesday when asked about Trump’s opposition to the insurer payments deal Alexander crafted with Murray. Indeed, Trump had spoken favorably about the deal around midday Tuesday, only to reverse course by the time evening rolled around.  On immigration, Trump at different times in recent weeks has offered to work with Democrats to protect young immigrants for deportation, denied such a deal is in the offing and suggested he could step in and craft a fix of his own.  Trump’s allies argue he is just pushing lawmakers to enact the agenda they were elected on. A newcomer to legislative politics, Trump also brings a business and showman’s perspective to negotiations, relishing drama and surprise.  Critics say Trump is comfortable making Congress the fall guy.  “He sees Congress’s public approval ratings lower than his. So he feels he has an advantage over Congress,” said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. “Whenever there’s a policy issue that’s thorny or undoable, he boots it to Congress to figure it out.  Brinkley added: “It’s the opposite of a buck-stops-here approach with Harry Truman.”  Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., who’s announced plans to retire and recently has been critical of Trump, says the president takes a different approach than past leaders.  “The more standard route is for the administration to lay out, for instance on health care ... a series of bullet points at the minimum, or a full bill. That’s typically the way things would work. So, yeah, it’s a very different way of governing and I think it’s one of the reasons you’ve seen the results to be what they are.”  Democrats are more pointed. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Trump is making everyone’s job harder.  “This seems to be his M.O.,” Schumer said. “He throws red meat to his right-wing base, whether it’s on health care, immigration, Iran, disaster aid, and then he says to Congress, ‘You fix it up.’ That’s not the way to lead. That’s following.”  ___  AP Congressional Correspondent Erica Werner contributed to this report.",2.880952380952381,42,"[0.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 0.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 2.5, 5.0, 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 4.0, 0.5, 5.0, 2.5, 3.0, 2.5, 3.5, 2.5, 2.5, 5.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 4.5, 0.5, 5.0, 1.5, 4.0, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 0.5, 4.5, 4.0, 2.5, 0.5, 2.0, 4.0]"

Zhou was born in Mexico after her family moved there from China. She wants to work in public health. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)  CHICAGO (AP) — Medical student Alejandra Duran Arreola dreams of becoming an OB-GYN in her home state of Georgia, where there’s a shortage of doctors and one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the U.S.  But the 26-year-old Mexican immigrant’s goal is now trapped in the debate over a program protecting hundreds of thousands of immigrants like her from deportation. Whether she becomes a doctor depends on whether Congress finds an alternative to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that President Donald Trump phased out last month.  Arreola, who was brought to the U.S. illegally at age 14, is among about 100 medical students nationwide who are enrolled in DACA, and many have become a powerful voice in the immigration debate. Their stories have resonated with leaders in Washington. Having excelled in school and gained admission into competitive medical schools, they’re on the verge of starting residencies to treat patients, a move experts say could help address the nation’s worsening doctor shortage.  “It’s mostly a tragedy of wasted talent and resources,” said Mark Kuczewski, who leads the medical education department at Loyola University’s medical school, where Arreola is in her second year. “Our country will have said, ‘You cannot go treat patients.’”  The Chicago-area medical school was the first to openly accept DACA students and has the largest concentration nationwide at 32. California and New York also have significant populations, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.  DACA gives protection to about 800,000 immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children and who otherwise would lack legal permission to be in the country. The immigrants must meet strict criteria to receive two-year permits that shield them from deportation and allow them to work.  Then-President Barack Obama created DACA in 2012. Critics call it an illegal amnesty program that is taking jobs from U.S. citizens. In rescinding it last month, Trump gave lawmakers until March to come up with a replacement.  Public support for DACA is wide. A recent poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research showed that just 1 in 5 Americans want to deport DACA recipients.  Medical students such as Arreola are trying to shape the debate, and they have the backing of influential medical groups, including the American Medical Association.  Arreola took a break from her studies last month to travel to Washington with fellow Loyola medical student and DACA recipient Cesar Montolongo Hernandez to talk to stakeholders. In their meetings with lawmakers, they framed the program as a medical necessity but also want a solution for others with DACA.  A 2017 report by the Association of American Medical Colleges predicts a shortfall of between about 35,000 and 83,000 doctors in 2025. That shortage is expected to increase with population growth and aging.  Hernandez, a 28-year-old from Mexico simultaneously pursuing a Ph.D., wants to focus his research on early detection of diseases. His work permit expires next September, and he’s worried he won’t qualify for scientific research funding without the program.  “I’ve shown I deserve to be here,” said Hernandez, who met with Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, a Democrat who’s called for Congress to quickly pass a replacement for DACA.  For Arreola it’s about returning to the state she’s called home since she was 14 and giving back to areas in need of doctors.  “My family is from there; I know those people,” Arreola said. “Those are the people that inspired to really give this a push.”  Among those Arreola met with were policy staff for Georgia Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson, who believes the Obama program was “an overreach of executive power” but also wants Congress to write a plan to protect DACA recipients.  Medical school administrators say the immigrant students stand out even among their accomplished peers: They’re often bilingual and bicultural, have overcome adversity and are more likely to work with underserved populations or rural areas.  “They come with a cultural competency for how to best treat the individuals from their background, whether immigrants or different races and ethnicities,” said Matthew Shick, a government relations director for the Association of American Medical Colleges. “That gets translated over to their peers in education and training.”  Zarna Patel, 24, is a third-year student at Loyola who was brought to the U.S. from India as a 3-year-old without any legal documents. Her DACA permit expires in January, and she’s trying to renew it so she can continue medical school rotations that require clinical work. If she’s able to work in U.S., Patel will work in disadvantaged areas of Illinois for four years, part of her agreement to get school loans.  “Growing up, I didn’t have insurance,” she said. “I knew what that felt like, being locked out of the whole system.”  For others, there’s added worry of being stuck with debt they can’t repay.  Marcela Zhou, who was born in Mexico after her family moved there from China, is in her third year at the University of California at Los Angeles’ medical school. She wants to work in public health.  “Can I even afford to finish medical school?” said Zhou, who was 12 when she came to the U.S. on a visitor visa that eventually expired. “It’s sort of hard sometimes to keep going.”  ___  Follow Sophia Tareen on Twitter at https://twitter.com/sophiatareen .

On Friday, Oct. 20, Yellen is scheduled to speak at the British Embassy in Washington on the subject of monetary policy since the financial crisis. (AP Photo/Dake Kang, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump signaled Friday that he is considering dual nominations for the Federal Reserve’s top two jobs.  Trump may appoint Jerome Powell, a member of the Fed’s board, potentially as chairman, and John Taylor, a Stanford University economist, as vice chairman, according to a transcript of an interview with Trump distributed by Fox Business.  Asked about that possibility, Trump said, according to Fox Business: “It is in my thinking, and I have a couple of others things in my thinking but I like talent and they’re both very talented people. It’s a hard decision.”  The interview is to air Sunday.  Speculation about Trump’s choice has intensified on Wall Street and in Washington as several candidates have met with the president in recent weeks.  Powell has served on the Fed board for five years and has voted to support Chair Janet Yellen’s low interest-rate policies. By contrast, Taylor, a favorite of some congressional Republicans, has long advocated a higher-rate policy to guard against inflation and asset bubbles.  Yellen, whose four-year term as chair ends in February, met with Trump at the White House on Thursday.  “I really like her a lot,” Trump said of Yellen in the interview with Fox Business. “So I have three people that I’m looking at. And there are a couple of others.”  Trump is also considering Kevin Warsh, a former Fed board member and former economic official in President George W. Bush’s administration.  Gary Cohn, Trump’s top economic adviser, has been under consideration, too, but reportedly fell out of favor after criticizing the president’s response to demonstrations by white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia in August.  During the presidential campaign, Trump sharply criticized Yellen, the first woman to lead the nation’s central bank, as being too political in the Fed post. Trump asserted that she was keeping rates low to favor Democrats.  But since taking office, Trump has dropped his criticism and has praised Yellen, saying she’s “done a good job” and favors low rates as he does.  “I will make my decision very shortly, pretty shortly,” Trump said in the interview with Fox Business, according to a transcript released Friday evening.  Besides the Fed chair position, Trump can also name a vice chair, with Stanley Fischer having just stepped down from that post.  ___  AP Economics Writer Martin Crutsinger contributed to this report.",3.1538461538461537,39,"[4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 2.5, 5.0, 2.0, 2.0, 1.5, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5, 3.0, 1.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.0, 4.5, 3.0, 4.5, 1.0, 4.0, 1.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 0.5, 4.0, 3.0, 2.5, 3.0, 2.0, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 5.0, 2.5]"

She used the company’s baby powder on a daily basis beginning in the 1950s until 2016 and was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2007, according to court papers.  Echeverria developed ovarian cancer as a “proximate result of the unreasonably dangerous and defective nature of talcum powder,” she said in her lawsuit.  Her attorney contended that documents showed that Johnson & Johnson knew about the risks of talc and ovarian cancer for three decades.  The company said it was pleased with the ruling.  “Ovarian cancer is a devastating disease — but it is not caused by the cosmetic-grade talc we have used in Johnson’s Baby Powder for decades. The science is clear and we will continue to defend the safety of Johnson’s Baby Powder as we prepare for additional trials in the U.S.,” spokeswoman Carol Goodrich said in a statement.  Similar allegations have led to hundreds of lawsuits against the New Jersey-based company. Jury awards have totaled hundreds of millions of dollars.  However, on Tuesday a Missouri appellate court threw out a $72 million award to the family of an Alabama woman who has died, ruling that the state wasn’t the proper jurisdiction for such a case.  The court cited a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June that placed limits on where injury lawsuits could be filed, saying state courts cannot hear claims against companies not based in the state where alleged injuries occurred.",3.6458333333333335,72,"[4.0, 5.0, 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 4.0, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 3.0, 3.5, 5.0, 0.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 3.0, 3.5, 5.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.0, 5.0, 2.0, 3.0, 1.0, 1.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.5, 0.5, 2.5, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 5.0, 1.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 3.5, 2.0, 2.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 5.0, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.0, 5.0, 3.0, 3.5, 4.5, 1.5, 4.5, 4.0, 1.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5]"

Bush for ‘destructive’ presidency,"Steve Bannon, a former White House adviser to President Donald Trump, speaks at the California Republican Convention in Anaheim, Calf., on Friday Oct. 20, 2017. Bannon wants to oust Republican senators he feels are disloyal to President Donald Trump. (AP Photo/Ringo H.W. Chiu)  ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — Former White House adviser Steve Bannon depicted former President George W. Bush as bumbling and inept, faulting him for presiding over a “destructive” presidency during his time in the White House.  Bannon’s scathing remarks on Friday night amounted to a retort to a Bush speech in New York earlier this week, in which the 43rd president denounced bigotry in Trump-era American politics and warned that the rise of “nativism,” isolationism and conspiracy theories have clouded the nation’s true identity.  But Bannon, speaking to a capacity crowd at a California Republican Party convention, said Bush had embarrassed himself and didn’t know what he was talking about.  Bannon said Bush has no idea whether “he is coming or going, just like it was when he was president.”  “There has not been a more destructive presidency than George Bush’s,” Bannon added, as boos could be heard in the crowd at the mention of Bush’s name.  The remarks came during a speech thick with attacks on the Washington status quo, echoing his call for an “open revolt” against establishment Republicans. He called the “permanent political class” one of the great dangers faced by the country.  A small group of protesters gathered outside the hotel where Bannon spoke, chanting and waving signs — one displaying a Nazi swastika. The protesters were kept behind steel barricades on a plaza across an entrance road at the hotel, largely out of view of people entering for the event. No arrests were reported.  Bannon also took aim at the Silicon Valley and its “lords of technology,” predicting that tech leaders and progressives in the state would try to secede from the union in 10 to 15 years. He called the threat to break up the nation a “living problem.”  He also tried to cheer long-suffering California Republicans, in a state that Trump lost by over 4 million votes and where Republicans have become largely irrelevant in state politics. In Orange County, where the convention was held, several Republican House members are trying to hold onto their seats in districts carried by Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential contest.  “You’ve got everything you need to win,” he told them.  He ended his speech with a standing ovation.  Bannon is promoting a field of primary challengers to take on incumbent Republicans in Congress. But in California, the GOP has been fading for years.  The state has become a kind of Republican mausoleum: GOP supporters can relive the glory days by visiting the stately presidential libraries of Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon, but today Democrats control every statewide office and rule both chambers of the Legislature by commanding margins.  Not all Republicans were glad to see Bannon. In a series of tweets last week, former state Assembly Republican leader Chad Mayes said he was shocked by the decision to have the conservative firebrand headline the event.  “It’s a huge step backward and demonstrates that the party remains tone deaf,” Mayes tweeted.  California Republicans have bickered for years over what direction to turn — toward the political center or to the right.  Bannon also argued that the coalition that sent Trump to the White House, including conservatives, Libertarians, populists, economic nationalists, evangelicals, could hold power for decades if they stay unified.  “If you have the wisdom, the strength, the tenacity, to hold that coalition together, we will govern for 50 to 75 years,” he said.  Most of the state’s governors in the 20th century were Republicans, and state voters helped elevate a string of GOP presidential candidates to the White House. But the party’s fortunes started to erode in the late 1990s after a series of measures targeting immigrants, which alienated growing segments of the state’s population.  In 2007, then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger warned party members that the GOP was “dying at the box office” and needed to move to the political center and embrace issues like climate change to appeal to a broader range of voters. In 2011, a state Republican Party committee blocked an attempt by moderates to push the state GOP platform toward the center on immigration, abortion, guns and gay rights.  The decline continued. Republicans are now a minor party in many California congressional districts, outnumbered by Democrats and independents. Statewide, Democrats count 3.7 million more voters than the GOP.  Political scientist Jack Pitney, who teaches at Claremont McKenna College, said he doubted the speech would color the 2018 congressional contests, which remain far off for most voters.  More broadly, he said Bannon’s politics would hurt the GOP, including among affluent, well-educated voters who play an important part in county elections.  “Inviting him was a moral and political blunder,” Pitney said in an email.",3.357142857142857,7,"[4.0, 3.5, 2.5, 4.5, 5.0, 0.5, 3.5]"

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)  WASHINGTON (AP) — A Washington appeals court is blocking for now an abortion sought by a pregnant 17-year-old immigrant being held in a Texas facility, ruling Friday that the government should be given time to try to release her so she can obtain the abortion outside of its custody.  A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued its ruling a few hours after hearing arguments from lawyers for the Trump administration and the teen. The court ruled 2-1 that the government should have until Oct. 31 to release the girl into the custody of a so-called sponsor, such as an adult relative in the United States. If that happens, she could obtain an abortion if she chooses. If she isn’t released, the case can go back to court.  The judge who dissented wrote that the court’s ruling means the teen will be forced to continue an unwanted pregnancy for “multiple more weeks.”  The teen, whose name and country of origin have been withheld because she’s a minor, is 15 weeks pregnant. She entered the U.S. in September and learned she was pregnant while in custody in Texas. She obtained a court order Sept. 25 permitting her to have an abortion. But federal officials have refused to transport her or temporarily release her so that others may take her to have an abortion. A lower federal court ruled earlier this week that she should be able to obtain an abortion Friday or Saturday, but the government appealed.  Federal health officials said in a statement Friday after the ruling that for “however much time” they are given they “will protect the well-being of this minor and all children and their babies” in their facilities.  Susan Hays, legal director of the Texas group Jane’s Due Process, which works with pregnant minors seeking an abortion and had offered to help pay for the teen’s abortion, said the court appeared to be “punting” the final decision on whether the teenager would be entitled to an abortion.  Brigitte Amiri, the ACLU lawyer who represented the teen in court, said in a statement after the ruling that the group is “investigating all avenues to get justice for her.”  “Justice is delayed yet again for this courageous and persistent young woman. She continues to be held hostage and prevented from getting an abortion because the Trump administration disagrees with her personal decision,” Amiri said. “Our client and women across this country should be able to access a safe, legal abortion without federal officials stepping in to interfere.”  The teen’s lawyers have argued that even a brief delay in allowing her to obtain an abortion could mean she may need a more complex procedure, one possibly not available in the region where she lives. If that happens, she could have to travel hundreds of miles to obtain an abortion, and if her case drags on she could lose her right to an abortion all together, her lawyers said. Texas law bans most abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy.  During arguments at the appeals court Friday morning, Amiri told the judges that all the government needed to do was “get out of the way.” An attorney appointed to represent the teen’s interests had said she could transport her to and from appointments necessary for the procedure, and the federal government would not have to pay for it.  But Trump administration lawyer Catherine Dorsey told the judges that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which is responsible for sheltering children who illegally enter the country unaccompanied by a parent, has a policy of “refusing to facilitate” abortions and that releasing the teen would require arranging a transfer of custody and follow-up care.  The appeals court suggested in part how it might rule during the hearing. Judge Brett Kavanaugh said that releasing the teen to a sponsor seemed to be the best option. That, he said, would get the teen out of the facility where she is being held, allow her to obtain an abortion and leave the government out of it. But Amiri said a sponsor hadn’t yet been found and that the process could take months. At least one potential sponsor has fallen through.  In a two-page order, Kavanaugh and Judge Karen Henderson, both of whom were appointed by Republican presidents, joined to say that if a sponsor is found by Oct. 31 and the teen released, the government agrees she “will be lawfully able, if she chooses, to obtain an abortion on her own pursuant to the relevant state law.”  The third judge on the panel, Judge Patricia Millett, who was appointed by a Democrat, President Barack Obama, would have allowed the girl to obtain an abortion as the lower court ruled earlier this week. Millett wrote that the girl “has already been forced by the government to continue an unwanted pregnancy for almost four weeks, and now, as a result of this order, must continue to carry that pregnancy for multiple more weeks.”  ___  Associated Press reporter Nomaan Merchant contributed from Houston.  ___  Follow Jessica Gresko on Twitter at http://twitter.com/jessicagresko .",3.8333333333333335,9,"[4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.0, 3.0, 2.5, 4.5, 5.0]"

Patty Murray, D-Wash., second from right, is surrounded by reporters as she heads to vote on budget amendments, Thursday, Oct. 19, 2017, in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Top Senate Democrats rejected White House demands Friday to add provisions weakening the Obama health care law to a bipartisan deal on steadying unsettled insurance markets. The compromise already faced an uphill path and this was the latest blow.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the Trump administration was involved in the negotiations that produced the accord and “should support it instead of floating other ideas that would further the sabotage both parties are trying to reverse.”  Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, lead Democratic author of the agreement, said, “I’m certainly not interested in changing our bipartisan agreement to move health care in the wrong direction.”  The two Democrats were reacting to a White House official who said the measure must provide language lifting the tax penalties President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act imposes on people who don’t buy coverage and employers who don’t offer plans to employees. The White House also wants provisions making it easier for people to buy low-premium policies with less coverage, said the official, who was not authorized to describe the demands on the record.  Such language would be a clear deal-breaker for Democrats, who’ve helped defeat repeated GOP efforts this year to scuttle Obama’s 2010 statute, one of his crowning achievements.  Murray reached agreement last week with Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., for a two-year extension of federal payments to insurers that President Donald Trump has blocked. The measure would also give states modest new flexibility to let insurers sidestep some coverage requirements under Obama’s law.  Failure to restore the money is already leading many insurers to boost premiums and is threatening to chase others out of unprofitable markets around the country.  Obama’s statute requires carriers to lower out-of-pocket costs for poorer customers and the government to reimburse them. A federal judge has found the payments weren’t properly approved by Congress, but Obama and Trump continued them until Trump halted them last week.  Trump’s position on the bipartisan deal has confounded Democrats and Republicans alike. He’s alternately praised and condemned the effort, even as Alexander has said that in four conversations in recent days, Trump has encouraged him to pursue a deal with Democrats.  The Alexander-Murray package would likely garner 60 votes in the Senate, mostly from Democrats, enough for it to survive a filibuster aimed at killing it.  But its fate has been clouded because of Trump’s qualms and opposition from House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and conservatives in that chamber and outside Congress.  In a written statement Friday, Alexander called the back-and-forth “the normal legislative process with people of different views saying what they are for and against.”  Asked Thursday about Marc Short, the White House legislative liaison who’s criticized the bipartisan measure, Alexander said: “I think I’ve talked to the president more about this than he has. And if he wants to carry out the president’s wishes, he’ll be encouraging me to succeed with this.”  ___  AP reporter Ken Thomas contributed.",2.8333333333333335,3,"[3.0, 0.5, 5.0]"

Acaba was barely outside an hour when he had to replace one of his safety tethers. Spacewalking astronauts always have more than one of these crucial lifelines in case one breaks. They also wear a jetpack in case all tethers fail and they need to fly back to the space station. (NASA via AP)  CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — A spacewalking astronaut successfully replaced a blurry camera outside the International Space Station on Friday, but had to contend with a balky jetpack and a frayed safety tether.  Both jetpacks and safety ties are crucial for saving a flyaway astronaut.  NASA said Joe Acaba was always securely attached to the orbiting outpost and never in any danger during the nearly seven-hour spacewalk.  But one of his tethers had to be replaced shortly after he and station commander Randy Bresnik floated outside. Mission Control noticed the red lifeline was frayed and worn. Bresnik went back to the air lock to get Acaba a spare.  Then five hours into the spacewalk, Mission Control saw that the right handle on Acaba’s emergency jetpack was popped open — again. Bresnik once more went to his crewmate’s assistance, even offering some tape to keep it down.  After consulting for several minutes in Houston, flight controllers declared the jetpack unreliable and ordered Acaba back inside, once he was done greasing the new robot arm on the space station’s big robot arm. He finished the lube job, then headed in.  Bresnik acknowledged things didn’t go as planned, “with all the stuff that happened today and the challenges we had.” But he thanked everyone for their hard work and diligence.  In the end, only a couple minor chores were left undone.  “Great work today,” Mission Control radioed as the spacewalk came to a close.  It was the third spacewalk in two weeks for U.S. astronauts. Bresnik went out on all three; he was accompanied by Mark Vande Hei to install the new robotic hand on Oct. 5 and lubricate it on Oct. 10.  Each spacewalker wears a jetpack for use in an emergency. It’s available in case an astronaut’s multiple tethers fail and allows the spacewalker to fly back to the station. It’s been tested by orbiting astronauts — years ago — but never called into urgent action.  Earlier, Acaba provided necessary focus to the space station’s robot arm.  He unbolted a blurry camera from the new robotic hand installed two weeks ago. He then popped in a spare, which flight controllers quickly tested from Houston. The replacement provided crisp, clear views.  Sharp focus is essential when the space station’s robot hand grabs an arriving supply ship and anchors it. The next delivery is a few weeks away, prompting the quick camera swap-out.  Orbital ATK, one of NASA’s commercial shippers, plans to launch a cargo ship from Virginia on Nov. 11.  Acaba and the station’s commander, Randy Bresnik, were supposed to go spacewalking earlier this week. But NASA needed extra time to add the camera repair to their chores.  Friday’s spacewalk — expected to be the last one for the year — also saw the astronauts installing a high-definition camera, replacing a fuse and removing thermal insulation from spare electronics. Early next year, astronauts will replace the hand on the opposite side of the 58-foot robot arm, Canada’s main contribution to the space station. The original latching mechanisms are showing wear and tear since the arm’s launch in 2001.  The 250-mile-high complex is currently home to three Americans, two Russians and one Italian.  A one-time high school and middle school teacher, Acaba is the first astronaut of Puerto Rican heritage; his parents were born there. He ventured out on Friday’s spacewalk as the station soared above the hurricane-ravaged island, where much of his extended family lives.  “There’s a whole line of people looking up and smiling today as you get ready to head out the door,” Bresnik told him.",4.6,5,"[5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 5.0, 3.5]"
889,2364,10,22,2017,2017-10-22,Associated Press News,Governor says change-resistant Indiana should think globally,"Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb responds to a question during an interview, Wednesday, Oct. 4, 2017, in Indianapolis. (AP Photo/Darron Cummings)  INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Factory work dwindled as companies moved operations overseas. Indiana, a manufacturing powerhouse where you once could get a good-paying job even without a high school education, was falling behind.  Yet when Subaru started building a plant here, it wasn’t celebrated as a coup for the Republican candidate for governor. Instead, a Democratic challenger was swept into office after running attack ads highlighting that the automaker was Japanese.  In a state where resistance to change is often touted as a virtue, historians say the xenophobic-tinged opposition to the Subaru factory was no exception.  Now, nearly 30 years later, Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb says Indiana’s prosperity relies on rethinking that approach.  “Isolation, digging a moat around yourself, filling it and saying, ‘We’re good,’ would be retreat from not just competing, but having the opportunity to win.” Holcomb said in an interview with The Associated Press.  “There’s a lot of good about ‘the good old days,’ but there’s a bigger windshield than rearview mirror,” he later added.  In recent months, Holcomb helped persuade India-based outsourcing firm Infosys to establish offices in Indianapolis, bringing a projected 2,000 jobs; got skeptical Republicans in the Statehouse to fund a direct flight between Indianapolis and Paris with hopes of luring European business; and signed an agreement to deepen economic ties with Japan.  On Friday, he will be leading a trade mission to India, his third such trip since taking office in January.  It’s not yet clear whether Holcomb’s efforts will amount to more than baby steps — or if change-averse Indiana is willing to go along.  If history is any guide, Holcomb is likely to face resistance. His vision of Indiana outcompeting larger commerce centers on the world stage also comes when nostalgia for the past and hostility to foreign trade are powerful political currents that helped elect President Donald Trump.  “Change in Indiana has always been evolutionary — moderate, slow, sometimes very slow,” said James H. Madison, an emeritus history professor at Indiana University who wrote the state’s definitive history, “Hoosiers.” ″When someone does try to move outside of the comfort zone, often they are slapped back down.”  Around the turn of the 20th century, those who embraced scientific agricultural advances in the agrarian state were often ridiculed as “book farmers.” In the 1920s, anxieties about immigrants and the loose morals of the Jazz Age fanned a surge in Ku Klux Klan membership, including among government officials.  Then there was former Lt. Gov. John Mutz’s race against Evan Bayh in 1988, in which Bayh attacked Mutz for his support of tax incentives that went to Subaru.  And just two years ago, Indiana — under then-Gov. Mike Pence — again found itself resisting change, as lawmakers, amid increased acceptance of same-sex marriage, created a legal defense for business owners opposed to serving gay people. The Legislature made changes to the law, but only after the state’s business community revolted and outsiders threatened to boycott Indiana.  Holcomb’s efforts come as experts say the Rust Belt state needs to develop a skilled workforce for jobs of the future while improving quality of life to make it a more attractive place to live. A 2015 Lumina Foundation report found only 42 percent of central Indiana residents have the education needed for most available jobs.  “We are at an inflection point, like when we moved from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy,” said Jason Kloth, president and CEO of Ascend Indiana, a policy advocacy group supported by some of the state’s largest employers. “It’s going to differentiate the communities that thrive in the next century.”  While Republicans who control state government celebrate the low-tax and limited-regulation environment they’ve helped establish, critics say lawmakers’ enthusiasm for conservative social causes could turn off businesses.  The Indiana Chamber of Commerce, Indianapolis-based drugmaker Eli Lilly and Columbus-based diesel company Cummins have pushed unsuccessfully for statewide gay rights protections.  While Holcomb has largely tried to avoid that issue, he wrote a letter in June welcoming visitors to Indianapolis’ gay pride festival. “Hoosier hospitality means that all are welcomed and valued” regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation, he wrote.  Katie Blair, a spokeswoman for the gay rights group Freedom Indiana, said Holcomb’s softer tone means little without action.  “It’s superficial.” Blair said. “A good way to make Indiana welcome all would be to update our state’s civil rights law to include sexual orientation and gender identity.”  Blair also noted that Holcomb signed laws this year targeting immigrants and abortion rights.  On the other end of the spectrum, such talk worries conservatives.  “We have a whole body of Republicans who are acting like Democrats and they will face consequences over that,” said Monica Boyer of the conservative Indiana Liberty Coalition.  Mutz, for his part, says he’s encouraged by Holcomb’s efforts to move the state forward.  “Hopefully, it will be good for his political career,” Mutz said. “I won’t say it derailed mine, but it certainly didn’t help.”  ___  Sign up for the AP’s weekly newsletter showcasing our best reporting from the Midwest and Texas: http://apne.ws/2u1RMfv",2.962962962962963,54,"[5.0, 1.5, 4.5, 2.5, 0.5, 3.0, 4.0, 1.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.0, 2.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 3.0, 0.5, 3.5, 4.5, 2.0, 1.5, 3.5, 1.5, 3.5, 2.5, 0.5, 3.0, 3.5, 0.5, 3.0, 4.0, 2.0, 4.0, 2.0, 2.5, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5, 0.5, 3.0, 2.0, 4.5, 3.5, 2.0, 1.5, 5.0, 3.0, 5.0, 4.5, 5.0, 3.0, 4.0, 4.0]"

Illanes and her family had to evacuate from there home as a massive wildfire swept through the area last week. While their home was sparred, Illanes, who is a baby sitter, and her husband, who is a landscaper, were both out of work for a work causing them to seek assistance due to the hardship. AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli)  SONOMA, Calif. (AP) — When the wildfires ignited, vineyard workers stopped picking grapes and fled for their lives. Some vineyard owners decided to stay and fight back, spending days digging firebreaks and sleeping among their vines for safety.  As the danger drew closer, grape pickers spread word of the threat and helped neighbors pack their homes. The owner of an elite golf resort abandoned his home to try to save his golf course.  The deadliest and most destructive wildfires in California history imperiled both the low-wage workers who harvest the nation’s most valuable wine grapes and the wealthy entrepreneurs who employ them. Vintners were suddenly plunged into the same desperate struggle as their laborers, with everyone fighting to preserve the things most precious to them — families, belongings and businesses.  On the public beach campgrounds where hundreds of evacuees escaped the flames, the affluent slept alongside migrant workers and combed through donated supplies.  “We had people in Mercedes and Lexuses showing up” with soot on their faces after losing everything, said Patty Ginochio, a volunteer who helped feed, house and clothe evacuees. Even some of the well-off “had nothing but the clothes on their back. It’s humbling.”  If anything, the fires seemed to target the affluent, blackening leafy suburban developments and hilltop estates more than the flatlands where many farm workers and middle-class families live.  Winery owners with multiple houses will take vastly different roads to recovery than the grape pickers who lost the only rental home they could hope to afford. But for a short time, fire was the great leveler in a region where the wealthiest 1 percent of people makes 20 times more than the rest.  Everybody thinks the winery owners are “rich guys and rich families, and they’re above everything,” said Adam Mariani, a fourth-generation farmer whose family runs the Scribe Winery in Sonoma. “But the truth is people are completely bootstrapping here” and worried about the effect of the fires on their livelihood.  The harvest was winding down on Oct. 8 as Gonzalo Jauregui worked an overnight grape-picking shift intended to protect workers and the fruit from the heat of the day. Around 10 p.m., a gale blew into the vineyard outside of Sonoma with a strength that the 45-year-old had never seen before.  “We saw the power lines bouncing against each other and trees losing their branches and sparks flying,” Jauregui recalled. The grape harvesters ran to their cars.  Dozens of other blazes were erupting at the same time across wine country, and Jauregui “could see the fire coming down the mountain.”  At the Scribe Winery, the winds disrupted a dinner among the vines, upending table settings. Diners who had hoped to linger over their meals were driven inside. Kelly Mariani, one of the family members there, recalled the ominous rattle of rattlesnakes in dry grass as the wind rose.  By midnight, flames had burned a neighbor’s home and were creeping down an oak ridge toward the winery buildings and family homes.  “There were hurricane winds. The house was rattling. The dog was barking,” said Adam Mariani, whose family has worked for a decade to rebuild the winery, which was eradicated during Prohibition and turned into a turkey farm.  As fires came over ridge after ridge above the wine valleys, Manuel Contreras lingered for days at a Sonoma apartment complex housing mostly migrant workers like him. He helped neighbors pack belongings and find transportation and shelters.  “I want to be the last person out,” he said.  While he spoke, firefighters and sheriff’s deputies went house to house and business to business to warn people that the flames were expected to arrive within hours. But, Contreras said, authorities never came to tell the Spanish-speaking workers.  “We were waiting for them to come to tell us” it was finally time to go, he said. The grape workers finally joined the evacuation when they saw streams of cars racing out of town.  At Napa’s championship Silverado golf resort, former PGA master Johnny Miller climbed to the roof of the white-pillared country club with a garden hose to save the clubhouse himself. He taped other hoses to the rails of balconies to spray water down on embers.  In one of the mansions near the course was Tim Wall, whose businesses include Rug Doctor carpet-cleaning and the golf resort. He made sure his family and animals were safe and left his home to its fate. Then he fought to save the golf course.  “I hadn’t thought of it that way,” Wall said of his decision to choose the course over his home. “If the house burned down, it wouldn’t be near the impact, economically or otherwise, to myself or other people.” The home survived.  In Sonoma County, Jauregui and his co-workers and neighbors sped home through smoke. They woke their families, then pounded on doors of their apartment building to wake others.  Adam Mariani, with help from a changing cast of relatives, friends, neighbors and passing crews of firefighters, used shovels and tractors to gouge firebreaks in the dirt.  Mariana and his brother figured their homes were lost, but they fought to save the winery’s restored hacienda, a landmark from the days of California’s first wine makers in the 1850s. When Adam needed to rest, he drove his car to the middle of the vineyards, where the live rows would resist fire.  The firebreaks, along with helicopter water drops from a reservoir maintained by the Gundlach-Bundschu winery and the vineyards themselves, helped crews finally turn the corner on the wildfires a week after the blazes began. In all, more than 100,000 acres burned in Napa, Sonoma and Solano counties, and more than 100,000 people evacuated.  Even as the flames eased, winery employees and owners alike faced economic fears. Many had gone more than a week without work, and months of rebuilding lay ahead. Shelters, soup kitchens and donation centers opened. Near Jauregui’s home, 2,500 returned evacuees lined up last Wednesday for free lunches.  That day, he knocked on the doors of a bakery and other businesses to ask for work.  Scribe employees returned Wednesday, many for the first time. The green and gold landscape was etched with dark char lines. Blackened trees surrounded the winery on three sides. But the old hacienda, the homes and the winery buildings still stood.  Winery workers came back with red eyes.

The Fox News Channel says the company knew a news analyst planned to file a sexual harassment lawsuit against O'Reilly when it renewed the popular personality's contract in February 2017. The New York Times reported Saturday, Oct. 21, 2017, the company renewed the TV host's contract after he reached a $32 million settlement with the analyst. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)  NEW YORK (AP) — The parent company of the Fox News Channel says it knew a news analyst planned to file a sexual harassment lawsuit against Bill O’Reilly when it renewed the popular personality’s contract in February.  The New York Times reported Saturday the company renewed O’Reilly’s contract after he reached a $32 million settlement with the analyst, Lis Wiehl.  In a statement, 21st Century Fox defended its decision because it said O’Reilly had settled the matter personally. It also said O’Reilly and Wiehl had agreed the financial terms would be kept confidential.  The company says O’Reilly’s new contract had added protections that allowed Fox to dismiss him if other allegations surfaced.  O’Reilly was ousted months later when it was revealed Fox had paid five women a total of $13 million to keep quiet about harassment allegations.  Mark Fabiani, a spokesman for O’Reilly, said in a statement Saturday that after 21st Century Fox fired founding CEO Roger Ailes in 2015 following harassment charges, dozens of women accused scores of male employees at Fox News Channel of harassment. The 77-year-old Ailes died in Palm Beach, Florida, last May.  21st Century Fox paid out close to $100 million dollars to settle all the cases, Fabiani said, adding that in O’Reilly’s 20 years working at the channel not one complaint was filed against him by a co-worker, even on an anonymous hotline.  Wiehl’s allegations included repeated harassment, a nonconsensual sexual relationship and the sending of gay pornography and other sexually explicit material to the woman, according to people briefed on the matter who spoke to The New York Times.  As part of the terms of their agreement, she signed an affidavit, dated Jan. 17 and obtained by the newspaper, stating that the two sides had resolved their dispute and that she had no claims against O’Reilly concerning any of the allegations in the draft complaint. All photos, text messages and other communications between the two would be destroyed, the newspaper reported.  The Associated Press emailed Wiehl on Saturday seeking comment.  The settlement was by far the largest of a half dozen deals made by O’Reilly or the company to settle harassment allegations against the host, according to the newspaper.  It was reached in January. A month later, 21st Century Fox granted O’Reilly a four-year extension on a $25 million-a-year contract. In April, it fired him.  Fabiani said the newspaper’s account was false and taken out of context. The New York Times said it stands by its reporting.  “Mr Fabiani addresses everything but what the story actually says. This article, like our previous reporting on the subject, is accurate and deeply reported and we welcome any challenge to the facts,” the newspaper said in a statement to The Associated Press on Saturday.  The most-watched figure in cable TV, O’Reilly has called his firing from the Fox News Channel a “political hit job” and that his network’s parent company made a business decision to get rid of him. O’Reilly also has said his conscience was clear in how he dealt with women.  The company said it has taken numerous steps to change its workplace environment.  “21st Century Fox has taken concerted action to transform Fox News, including installing new leaders, overhauling management and on-air talent, expanding training, and increasing the channels through which employees can report harassment or discrimination,” Fox said in a statement emailed to the AP. “These changes come from the top, with Lachlan and James Murdoch personally leading the effort to promote civility and respect on the job, while maintaining the company’s long-held commitment to a diverse, inclusive and creative workplace.”  O’Reilly hosts his “No Spin News” podcast on his website, www.billoreilly.com, contributes to Glenn Beck’s radio program on TheBlaze and continues to write books in his best-selling series of historical “Killing” books, including his newest release, “Killing England: The Brutal Struggle for American Independence.”  ____  This story has been corrected to say Ailes died in Palm Beach, Florida, not Los Angeles.",3.051948051948052,77,"[2.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.0, 4.5, 5.0, 2.5, 3.5, 0.5, 4.0, 2.0, 2.5, 4.0, 2.5, 2.5, 3.5, 3.0, 5.0, 0.5, 4.5, 4.0, 3.0, 5.0, 2.0, 1.5, 2.5, 5.0, 5.0, 1.5, 1.5, 4.5, 3.0, 3.5, 2.5, 4.0, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 1.5, 4.5, 1.5, 2.5, 0.5, 4.0, 5.0, 3.5, 1.0, 5.0, 1.5, 1.0, 1.5, 4.5, 3.5, 1.5, 4.0, 1.0, 0.5, 4.0, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 0.5, 4.5, 3.0, 2.5, 2.5, 3.0, 3.0, 3.5, 1.0, 5.0, 0.5]"

Bush and Jimmy Carter place their hands on their chest for the national anthem on stage at the opening of a hurricanes relief concert in College Station, Texas, Saturday, Oct. 21, 2017. All five living former U.S. presidents joined to support a Texas concert raising money for relief efforts from Hurricane Harvey, Irma and Maria's devastation in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. (AP Photo/LM Otero)  AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — The five living former presidents put aside politics and appeared together for the first time since 2013 at a concert on Saturday to raise money for victims of devastating hurricanes in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  Democrats Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter and Republicans George H.W. and George W. Bush gathered in College Station, Texas, home of Texas A&M University, to try to unite the country after the storms.  Texas A&M is home to the presidential library of the elder Bush. At 93, he has a form of Parkinson’s disease and appeared in a wheelchair at the event. His wife, Barbara, and George W. Bush’s wife, Laura, were in the audience.  Grammy award winner Lady Gaga made a surprise appearance at the concert that also featured country music band Alabama, Rock & Roll Hall of Famer ‘Soul Man’ Sam Moore, gospel legend Yolanda Adams and Texas musicians Lyle Lovett and Robert Earl Keen.  The appeal backed by the ex-presidents has raised $31 million since it began on Sept. 7, said Jim McGrath, spokesman for George H.W. Bush.  President Donald Trump offered a video greeting that avoided his past criticism of the former presidents and called them “some of America’s finest public servants.”  “This wonderful effort reminds us that we truly are one nation under God, all unified by our values and devotion to one another,” Trump said in the greeting, played during the concert.  Four of the five former presidents — Obama, George W. Bush, Carter and Clinton — made brief remarks that did not mention Trump. The elder Bush did not speak but smiled and waved to the crowd. They appealed for national unity to help those hurt by the hurricanes.  “The heart of America, without regard to race or religion or political party, is greater than our problems,” said Clinton.  The last time the five were together was in 2013, when Obama was still in office, at the dedication of George W. Bush’s presidential library in Dallas.  There is precedent for former presidents joining forces for post-disaster fundraising. George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton raised money together after the 2004 South Asia tsunami and Hurricane Katrina the next year. Clinton and George W. Bush combined to seek donations after Haiti’s 2011 earthquake.  “It’s certainly a triple, if not a home run, every time,” said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor at the University of Houston. “Presidents have the most powerful and prolific fundraising base of any politician in the world. When they send out a call for help, especially on something that’s not political, they can rake in big money.”  Amid criticism that his administration was initially slow to aid ravaged Puerto Rico, Trump accused island leaders of “poor leadership,” and later tweeted that, “Electric and all infrastructure was disaster before hurricanes” while saying that Federal Emergency Management Agency, first-responders and military personnel wouldn’t be able to stay there forever.  But Rottinghaus said ex-presidents are seen as less polarizing than the current president.  “They can’t get away from the politics of the moment,” he said of current White House occupants. “Ex-presidents are able to step back and be seen as the nation’s grandfather.”  Hurricane Harvey slammed into Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast as a Category 4 hurricane on Aug. 25, unleashing historic flooding in Houston and killing more than 80 people. Shortly thereafter, all five ex-presidents appeared in a commercial for a fundraising effort known as “One America Appeal.” In it, George W. Bush says, “People are hurting down here.” His father, George H.W. Bush, then replies, “We love you, Texas.”  Hurricane Irma subsequently hit Florida and Hurricane Maria battered Puerto Rico, while both devastated the U.S. Virgin Islands.  A website accepting donations, OneAmericaAppeal.org, was created with 100 percent of proceeds pledged to hurricane relief.  ___  Sign up for the AP’s weekly newsletter showcasing our best reporting from the Midwest and Texas: http://apne.ws/2u1RMfv",4.25,4,"[4.5, 5.0, 4.5, 3.0]"

Navigating ongoing rifts on the political left, Perez said party unity is crucial in the fight against Trump, whom he lambasted as an “existential threat” to the nation. “We have the most dangerous president in American history and one of the most reactionary Congresses in American history,” Perez said as he addressed the first national party gathering since his election in February. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File)  LAS VEGAS (AP) — Trying to quell accusations that he is ousting activists from the party’s left flank, Democratic Chairman Tom Perez told fellow Democrats on Saturday that unity is crucial in the fight against President Donald Trump, whom he lambasted as an “existential threat” to the nation.  “We have the most dangerous president in American history and one of the most reactionary Congresses in American history,” Perez said as he addressed the first Democratic National Committee gathering since his February election.  The former Obama Cabinet official blistered “a culture of corruption” that he said extends to Trump’s Cabinet, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, but he warned that internal ruckuses over party priorities and leadership would distract from the goal of winning more elections to upend Republicans’ domination in Washington.  The chairman’s plea comes amid a rift over his appointments to little-known but influential party committees and the 75 at-large members of the national party committee. Perez and his aides plug his choices as a way to make the DNC younger and more diverse, but the moves also mean demotions for several prominent Democrats who backed Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential primaries and then supported Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison over Perez in the postelection race for party chairman.  Perez spent time during this week’s proceedings meeting privately with frustrated DNC members, including some he did not reappoint. He apologized publicly Saturday for not reaching all of those members before he announced his appointments, but he defended his overall aim.  “If someone ever asks you which wing of the party you belong to, tell ’em you belong to the accomplishment wing of the Democratic Party,” he said, “because you’re trying to get s--- done. That’s what we’re trying to do here, folks. We’re trying to move the ball forward.”  Republicans, meanwhile, have exalted in the internal wrangle, painting the DNC as incompetently discordant.  “The Democratic Party’s message of doom and gloom has left them leaderless and nearly extinct in most of the country,” Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Ahrens said. “If Tom Perez wants his party to stick with that same failed strategy, Republicans will gladly keep working to help the middle class by cutting their taxes and fixing our broken health care system.”  To some extent, the Democrats’ developments reflect routine party politics after an unusually contentious chairman’s race, but they also fit into the ongoing philosophical tussle on the left.  Sanders’ backers accused the DNC in 2016 of stacking the nominating process in Clinton’s favor and shutting out the Vermont independent who still seeks to pull the party toward his ideology. Those frustrations carried over into the DNC chair race between Perez, the former labor secretary, and Ellison.  Now, Perez’s appointees will hold sway over setting the primary calendar in 2020 and, perhaps most importantly, whether the party’s superdelegates, including the 75 at-large members, will continue to cast presidential nominating votes at Democratic conventions without being bound to any state primary or caucus results.  Democrats are looking next month to hold the Virginia governor’s seat and wrest the New Jersey governor’s seat from Republican control. Next year, Democrats need to flip at least 24 Republican congressional seats to regain control of the House. They face an uphill battle in gaining control of the Senate, because they must defend 10 incumbents in states Trump won last November. Democrats also want to increase their gubernatorial roster from the current 15 state executives.  Separately, former Attorney General Eric Holder urged the party to play the long game necessary to overcome Republican advantages scored when GOP-run legislatures drew congressional and legislative districts around the country after the 2010 census.  Holder leads a political action group, with fundraising support for former President Barack Obama, to back candidates in states where gerrymandering gives Democrats an uphill path to majorities. He singled out Virginia, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia and Texas, among other states, where Republicans “picked their voters” with districts that “are impressive in their geographic creativity but they are destructive to representative democracy.”  The Supreme Court earlier this month heard oral arguments in a case challenging the Wisconsin districts. Legal analysts expect Justice Anthony Kennedy, often the court’s swing vote, will decide whether the court for the first time declares partisan gerrymandering unconstitutional.  ___  Follow Bill Barrow on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BillBarrowAP .",2.75,2,"[0.5, 5.0]"

Mourners remembered not only a U.S. soldier whose combat death in Africa led to a political fight between President Donald Trump and a Florida congresswoman but his three comrades who died with him. (Matias J. Ocner/Miami Herald via AP)  COOPER CITY, Fla. (AP) — Mourners Saturday remembered not only a U.S. soldier whose combat death in Africa led to a political fight between President Donald Trump and a Florida congresswoman but his three comrades who died with him.  Some of the 1,200 mourners exiting the church after the service said the portrait of Sgt. La David Johnson, 25, was joined on stage by photographs of his slain comrades. The four died Oct. 4 in Niger when they were attacked by militants tied to the Islamic State. Johnson’s family asked reporters to remain outside for the service.  “We have to remember that one thing: that it wasn’t just one soldier who lost his life,” said Berchel Davis, a retired police officer who has six children in the military. He said the preacher and Rep. Frederica Wilson both made that a part of their talks. “That was a good gesture on everyone’s part.”  He and others said the fight between Trump and Wilson was never mentioned during the service.  Staff Sgt. Bryan C. Black, 35, of Puyallup, Washington; Staff Sgt. Jeremiah W. Johnson, 39, of Springboro, Ohio; and Staff Sgt. Dustin M. Wright, 29, of Lyons, Georgia, were killed along with La David Johnson in Niger.  Funeral services were held to honor a U.S. soldier whose combat death in Niger, combined with three others, is being investigated by the Pentagon. (Oct. 21)  La David Johnson’s pregnant widow, Myeshia, had held the arm of an Army officer as she led her two young children and her family, dressed in white, into the Christ the Rock Community Church in suburban Fort Lauderdale. The modern hymn “I’m Yours” could be heard coming from inside.  Johnson’s sister, Angela Ghent, said after the service that “it don’t feel real” that her brother was killed.  “It hasn’t hit me yet, I haven’t had time to grieve,” said Ghent, who last spoke to her brother a few weeks before he died. She said she was glad mourners got to hear about her brother’s love for bikes and cars, not just his military service.  The fight between Trump and Wilson had taken the focus off Johnson, whose widow is due to have a daughter in January. Sgt. Johnson told friends she will be named La’Shee. The couple, who were high school sweethearts, already had a 6-year-old daughter, Ah’Leeysa, and 2-year-old son, La David Jr. An online fundraiser has raised more than $600,000 to pay for the children’s education.  Johnson’s mother died when he was 5; he was raised by his aunt. His family enrolled him in 5000 Role Models, a project Wilson began in 1993 when she was an educator where African-American boys are paired with mentors who prepare them for college, vocational school or the military.  “We teach them to be a good man, a good husband and a good father. Sgt. Johnson typified all of those characteristics,” said mourner Carlton Crawl, a public school consultant who is one of the program’s mentors.  In 2013, a year before he enlisted, Johnson was featured in a local television newscast for his ability to do bicycle tricks, earning the nickname “Wheelie King.” He said he learned his tricks by going slow.  “Once you feel comfortable, you could just ride all day,” he told the interviewer.  The war of words between the president and Wilson began Tuesday when the Miami-area Democrat said Trump told Myeshia Johnson in a phone call that her husband “knew what he signed up for” and didn’t appear to know his name, a version later backed up by Johnson’s aunt. Wilson was riding with Johnson’s family to meet the body and heard the call on speakerphone. She was principal of a school Johnson’s father attended.  Trump tweeted Wilson “fabricated” his statement and the fight escalated through the week. Trump in other tweets called her “wacky” and accused her of “SECRETLY” listening to the phone call.  Trump’s chief of staff, John Kelly, entered the fray Thursday. The retired Marine general asserted that the congresswoman had delivered a 2015 speech at an FBI field office dedication in which she “talked about how she was instrumental in getting the funding for that building,” rather than keeping the focus on the fallen agents for which it was named. Video of the speech contradicted his recollection.  Wilson, who is black, fired back Friday when she told The New York Times: “The White House itself is full white supremacists.”  The retorts persisted Saturday morning, with Trump tweeting: “I hope the Fake News Media keeps talking about Wacky Congresswoman Wilson in that she, as a representative, is killing the Democrat Party!”",4.3,5,"[5.0, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 3.0]"
918,2409,10,22,2017,2017-10-22,Associated Press News,Tillerson seeks Arab help in US effort to isolate Iran," U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson took the Trump administration’s case for isolating and containing Iran in the Middle East and beyond to two Gulf Arab nations on Sunday, pushing for Saudi Arabia and Iraq to unite to counter growing Iranian assertiveness. He also called for a quick resolution to the ongoing crisis between Qatar and its Arab neighbors, which he said was unintentionally bolstering Iran.  In Saudi Arabia and later Qatar, Tillerson denounced Iran’s “malign behavior” and urged nations of the region and elsewhere, notably Europe, to join the administration to halt any business they do with Iran’s powerful Revolutionary Guard. He also demanded that Iranian and Iran-backed Shiite militia in Iraq either return to their homes, integrate into the Iraqi army or leave the country.  “Those fighters need to go home,” Tillerson said. “Any foreign fighters need to go home.”  In Riyadh for the inaugural meeting of the Saudi Arabia-Iraq Coordination Council — a vehicle that U.S. officials believe can wean Iraq from Iran — Tillerson told Saudi King Salman and Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi that the nascent partnership between their countries held great promise for Iraq’s reconstruction after devastating battles to wrest territory from the Islamic State group and its independence from foreign influence.  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson took the Trump administration's case for isolating and containing Iran in the Middle East and beyond to two Gulf Arab nations, pushing for Saudi Arabia and Iraq to unite to counter growing Iranian assertiveness. (Oct. 22)  “We believe this will in some ways counter some of the unproductive influences of Iran inside of Iraq,” he said at a news conference with Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir after the council meeting.  Tillerson said countries outside of the region could also play a role, primarily by shunning the Revollutionary Guard, which play a major role in Iran’s economy and were added to a U.S. terrorism blacklist earlier this month. Companies and countries that do business with the guards “really do so at great risk,” he said.  “We are hoping that European companies, countries and others around the world will join the U.S. as we put in place a sanctions structure to prohibit certain activities of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard that foment instability in the region and create destruction in the region,” Tillerson said.  At the council meeting, Tillerson praised the Saudi king and Abadi for the August reopening of a major border crossing and the resumption of direct flights between Riyadh and Baghdad last week.  “Both represent the beginning of what we hope will be a series of even more tangible actions to improve relations and strengthen cooperation on a host of issues,” he said. “Your growing relationship between the kingdom and Iraq is vital to bolstering our collective security and prosperity and we take great interest in it.”  His participation in the meeting comes as U.S. officials step up encouragement of a new axis that unites Saudi Arabia and Iraq as a bulwark against Iran’s growing influence from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean Sea. Amid the push for that alliance, the Iraqi government is struggling to rebuild recently liberated Islamic State strongholds and confronts a newly assertive Kurdish independence movement.  History, religion and lots of politics stand in Tillerson’s way, but both the Saudi king and the Iraqi prime minister appeared optimistic about the prospects.  “We are facing in our region serious challenges in the form of extremism, terrorism as well as attempts to destabilize our countries,” Salman said. “These attempts require our full attention. ... We reaffirm our support for the unity and stability of our brother country of Iraq.”  Abadi expressed pleasure with “the thriving relations between our two brotherly countries.”  “We are open and we want to move away from the past,” he said. “The region cannot tolerate any further divisions. Interference in the internal affairs of other state should stop.”  Shiite-majority Iraq and Sunni-led Saudi Arabia, estranged for decades after Saddam Hussein’s 1990 invasion of Kuwait, have tried in recent years to bridge their differences. Saudi Arabia reopened its embassy in Baghdad in 2015 after a quarter century. The first visit by a Saudi foreign minister to Baghdad came in February this year, followed by the border crossing reopening in August and resumption of direct flights between the capitals suspended during the Gulf War.  Over the weekend, the Saudi oil minister, Khalid al-Falih, made a high-profile appearance at Baghdad’s International Fair, and held talks with his Iraqi counterpart, Jabar al-Luabi.  Nevertheless, the relationship is plagued by suspicion. Iran’s reported intervention in Iraq’s semiautonomous northern Kurdish region, after last month’s much criticized vote for independence in a referendum, has deepened the unease.;After his talks in Riyadh, Tillerson flew to the Qatari capital of Doha, a direct route that has been closed to commercial airlines since June when the now-five-month old crisis between Qatar and Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates erupted, ostensibly over terrorism financing. Qatar and Bahrain are home to major U.S. military bases in the Middle East, the al-Udeid Air Base near Doha and the headquarters of the U.S. 5th Fleet in Manama.  Tillerson has attempted to facilitate a dialogue through talks with the feuding parties as well as supporting a Kuwaiti mediation effort but has thus far been unsuccessful. He renewed those calls but allowed that progress seemed unlikely. “We cannot force talks between parties who are not ready to talk,” he said.  “The United States remains concerned that the dispute has had negative consequences economically and militarily; the U.S. has felt these effects as well,” he said. “None of us can afford to let this dispute linger. We ask that everyone ease the rhetoric and deescalate the tensions.”  Tillerson noted that the only country benefiting from the crisis is Iran, which is now Qatar’s lifeline as its neighbors have sealed their land, sea and air borders. He said Qatar’s new reliance on Iranian airspace is “the most immediate and obvious gain that Iran has.”  “Anytime there is conflict and destabilization among countries that are typically allies, someone will always come in to exploit those differences,” he added.  __  Associated Press writer Aya Batrawy in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.",3.7777777777777777,9,"[3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5]"

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)  WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump shot down a possible approach for raising revenue to finance tax cuts in politically must-do legislation for the Republicans, promising Monday the popular 401(k) retirement savings program will be untouched.  Still, the head of the House’s tax-writing committee indicated that changes to the 401(k) structure may still be on the table as Republicans push an ambitious timetable to get tax legislation written. Asked about the issue, Ways and Means Committee Chair Rep. Kevin Brady said: “I don’t want to get ahead of the committee. That will all be part of the tax reform bill.”  And in response to whether Trump’s tweet changes in any way what the panel was planning to do, Brady replied only, “no.”  Republicans are scrambling to find new revenue sources to pay for anticipated tax cuts exceeding $1 trillion. A proposal to eliminate the widely-used federal deduction for state and local taxes has run into heavy opposition from GOP House members from high-tax states, threatening the enactment of tax legislation that Republicans deem essential to retaining their majority in next year’s elections.  Trump pledged in a tweet there will be “no change” to tax incentives for the 401(k) retirement programs.  The No. 2 Republican in the Senate, Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas, said he’s “sympathetic” to Trump’s opposition to curbing 401(k)s because “we don’t want to discourage people from saving.”  But he cautioned against ruling out ideas at this stage of the legislative process. “I do think we need to be careful because there are going to be a lot of different trial balloons, and what counts is how you put all this together,” Cornyn said.  The plan crafted by Trump and Republican leaders calls for steep tax cuts for corporations and potentially individuals, a doubling of the standard deduction used by most Americans, shrinking the number of tax brackets from seven to three or four, and the repeal of inheritance taxes on multimillion-dollar estates. The child tax credit would be increased and the tax system would be simplified; most Americans would be able to file their income taxes on a postcard, according to the plan.  There will be NO change to your 401(k). This has always been a great and popular middle class tax break that works, and it stays! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2017  Crucial details of the plan have yet to be worked out, notably what income levels would fit with each tax bracket.  With the possibility of the state and local deduction being at least partly preserved, some Republican lawmakers were considering limiting the amount workers could save in 401(k) retirement accounts.  “It was a trial balloon and it crashed,” said Brian Riedl, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute. “They’re struggling to find legitimate offsets” for tax cuts.  “Everyone has been promised they are going to be better off with tax reform and that’s really hard to do in a fiscally responsible way,” Riedl said.  Employees’ earnings from defined-contribution retirement plans such as 401(k)s aren’t taxed until retirement; pay-ins by both employers and employees also receive tax-preferred status. That cost the government $82.7 billion in lost revenue in the recent budget year ending Sept. 30, 2016 — a potentially juicy target for Republican tax-cutters.  With 55 million U.S. workers holding some $5 trillion in their 401(k) accounts, the plans have become a touchstone of retirement security for the middle class.  “This has always been a great and popular middle class tax break that works, and it stays!” Trump tweeted. “There will be NO change to your 401(k).”  Appearing with Ivanka Trump in Pennsylvania, U.S. Treasurer Jovita Carranza echoed the president, telling the audience the retirement plans “will not be touched.”  Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn., the chairman of the House Budget Committee, said of the Trump-rejected proposal on retirement plans: “There are still some dials that do have to be turned. This is a major effort and when you dial one thing you have to look at another.”  House Republicans will be working to pass a budget this week so they can turn their attention to the tax overhaul. Trump warned Sunday that action on tax reform is crucial to avoiding political failure in 2018. He’ll work to rally support for the plan at the Capitol Tuesday at a lunch with Senate Republicans.  Trump personally implored House GOP members on a conference call to swiftly adopt the budget that was passed last week by the Senate, with the hope of clearing the way for what he described as historic tax cuts.  Trump told the lawmakers they were on the verge of doing something historic, according to one Republican official, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss publicly what was intended as a private update for members.  Another GOP aide familiar with the conversation said Trump told the members again and again that the party would pay a steep price in next year’s midterm elections if it failed to pass his plan.  The Senate last week passed a budget plan that includes rules that will allow Republicans to get tax legislation through the Senate without Democratic votes or fear of a Democratic filibuster. House Republicans signaled Friday they would simply accept the Senate plan to avoid any potential delay on the tax measure.  Republicans are desperate to rack up a legislative win after a series of embarrassing failures despite the party controlling both chambers of Congress and the White House. Topping the list: their stalled attempts to pass legislation repealing and replacing “Obamacare.” If tax overhaul legislation doesn’t pass, many in the party fear a complete rout in 2018.  ___  AP Congressional Correspondent Erica Werner and AP writers Jill Colvin, Alan Fram and Andrew Taylor contributed to this report.",3.9166666666666665,6,"[3.5, 4.5, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5]"

(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate on Monday gave a preliminary OK to a $36.5 billion hurricane relief package that would provide Puerto Rico with a much-needed infusion of cash and keep the federal flood insurance program from running out of money to pay claims.  The 79-16 procedural vote set the stage for a final vote, most likely Tuesday.  The measure also provides $18.7 billion to replenish the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s rapidly dwindling emergency disaster accounts. On Monday, FEMA announced more than $500 million in aid to Puerto Rico, including $285 million to help restore power and water services to the devastated island. An additional $16 billion would permit the financially troubled federal flood insurance program to pay an influx of Harvey-related claims.  But the bill rejects requests from the powerful Texas and Florida congressional delegations for additional money to rebuild after hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Florida Democrat Bill Nelson, whose state’s citrus industry endured significant losses during Irma, sought to add $3 billion in immediate agriculture assistance to the measure, but was denied by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who said money for crop losses would be in subsequent aid measures.  Senate passage on Tuesday would send the measure to President Donald Trump for his signature.  There was urgency to move the measure swiftly — rather than add more money to it at this time — because the government’s disaster response and flood insurance reserves are running out. Democrat Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont said that would happen “in a matter of days” without action.  Still, members of the Texas and Florida delegations in Congress are unhappy because the measure failed to address extensive requests for additional hurricane rebuilding money. Texas, inundated by Harvey in August, requested $19 billion, while Florida sought $27 billion.  “I’m pretty disappointed with what the House sent over,” Texas GOP Sen. John Cornyn said last week. But later, after speaking to both Trump and White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, Cornyn said he was promised that the White House would issue another disaster aid measure next month for Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico. A fourth, and perhaps final, measure is likely to anchor a year-end spending bill.  “The victims of these hurricanes can continue to count on our support,” said McConnell said.  Up to $5 billion of the measure’s total could be used to assist Puerto Rico’s central government and various municipalities that are suffering unsustainable cash shortfalls as Maria has choked off revenues and strained resources. An additional $150 million would help Puerto Rico with the 10 percent match required for FEMA disaster relief.  More than one-fourth of the island’s residents don’t have potable running water and only 17 percent have electricity, according to FEMA. Just 392 miles of Puerto Rico’s 5,073 miles of roads are open. Conditions in the U.S. Virgin Islands are bad as well, with widespread power outages.  But Trump last week graded his response to the Puerto Rico disaster a 10 on a scale of 10.  “President Trump seems more concerned about claiming credit for a job well done than the actual situation on the ground deserves, particularly in Puerto Rico,” Leahy said. “This is the hard part of governing,” he added. “We dig in for the long haul, we stop patting ourselves on the back.”  The measure currently before the Senate contains $577 million for wildfires in the West that forced agencies to tap other reserves for firefighting accounts and FEMA money.  Republicans delayed action last year on modest requests by President Barack Obama to combat the Zika virus and help Flint, Michigan, repair its lead-tainted water system. But they are moving quickly to take care of this year’s alarming series of disasters, quickly passing a $15.3 billion relief measure last month and signaling that another installment is coming next month.  Damage is still being assessed and final cost estimates for recovering and rebuilding from this year’s hurricane season are not in yet. Some House conservatives are becoming restive at the high price tag for the disasters, which come as the deficit is growing.",2.3333333333333335,3,"[4.0, 0.5, 2.5]"

Batista wants to appeal the government cutting her from the program, but doesn't have enough money to take buses to the administrative office downtown. (AP Photo/Silvia Izquierdo)  RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — When Leticia Miranda had a job selling newspapers on the streets, she earned about $160 a month, just enough to pay for a tiny apartment she shared with her 8-year-old son in a poor neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro.  When she lost her job about six months ago amid Brazil’s worst economic crisis in decades, Miranda had no choice but to move to an abandoned building where several hundred people were already living. All of her possessions — a bed, a fridge, a stove and some clothes — have been jammed into a small room that like all the others in the building has windows with no glass. Residents bathe in large garbage cans filled with water and do their best to live with the stench of mountains of trash and rummaging pigs in the center of the building.  “I want to leave here, but there is nowhere to go,” said Miranda, 28, dressed in a bikini top, shorts and sandals to deal with the heat. “I’m applying for jobs and did two interviews. So far, nothing.”  Between 2004 and 2014, tens of millions of Brazilians emerged from poverty and the country was often cited as an example for the world. High prices for the country’s raw materials and newly developed oil resources helped finance social welfare programs that put money into the pockets of the poorest.  But that trend has been reversed over the last two years due to the deepest recession in Brazil’s history and cuts to the subsidy programs, raising the specter that this continent-sized nation has lost its way in addressing wide inequalities that go back to colonial times.  “Many people who had risen out of poverty, and even those who had risen into the middle class, have fallen back,” said Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics.  The World Bank estimates about 28.6 million Brazilians moved out of poverty between 2004 and 2014. But the bank estimates that from the start of 2016 to the end of this year, 2.5 million to 3.6 million will have fallen back below the poverty line of 140 Brazilian reais per month, about $44 at current exchange rates.  Those figures are likely underestimates, de Bolle said, and they don’t capture the fact that many lower-middle class Brazilians who gained ground during the boom years have since slid back closer to poverty.  Economists say high unemployment and cuts to key social welfare programs could exacerbate the problems. In July, the last month for which data is available, unemployment was close to 13 percent, a huge increase from 4 percent at the end of 2004.  Lines of job-seekers stretching several blocks have become commonplace whenever any business announces openings. When a university in Rio this month offered low-skilled jobs paying $400 a month, thousands showed up, including many who stood outside in the rain a day before the process began.  Meanwhile, budgetary pressures and the conservative policies of President Michel Temer are translating into cuts in social services. Among those hit is the Bolsa Familia — Family Allowance — program that gives small subsidies each month to qualifying low-income people. It’s credited with much of the poverty reduction during Brazil’s boom decade.  Non-labor income, including social programs like Bolsa Familia, accounted for nearly 60 percent of the reduction in the number of people living in extreme poverty during the boom decade, said Emmanuel Skoufias, a World Bank economist and one of the authors of the report on Brazil’s “new poor.”  Now, even as job losses have been pushing more people toward the program, fewer are being covered.  “Every day is a struggle to survive,” 40-year-old Simone Batista said, tears streaming down her face as she recounted being cut from Bolsa Familia after her now 1-year-old was born. She wants to appeal, but doesn’t have enough money to take buses to the administrative office downtown. Batista lives in Jardim Gramacho, a slum in northern Rio where she and hundreds of other destitute residents find food by rummaging through garbage illegally dumped in the area.  An Associated Press review of Bolsa Familia data found coverage declined 4 percentage points between May 2016, when Temer became acting president, and May of this year. Part of that may be due to a crackdown on alleged fraud that started late last year. Temer’s administration announced it had found “irregularities” in the records of 1.1 million recipients — about 8 percent of the 14 million people who receive the benefit. The infractions ranged from fraud to families that were earning above $150 a month, the cutoff to receive the benefit.  “The government shouldn’t lose focus on the priority” of keeping people out of poverty, said Skoufias, adding that Bolsa Familia represented only about 0.5 percent of Brazil’s gross domestic product and the government should be looking to allocate more, not fewer, resources to it.  Still, any discussion of increased spending is likely doomed in Congress, where a spending cap was passed earlier this year and Temer is pushing to make large cuts to the pension system. The fiscal situation is even worse for many states, including Rio.  A year after hosting the 2016 Summer Olympics, Rio is so broke that thousands of public workers are not being paid, or are being paid late in installments. Many budget items, from garbage collection to a community policing program, have been sharply reduced.  For many who live in Rio’s hundreds of favelas, or slums, an already hardscrabble existence feels increasingly precarious.  Maria de Pena Souza, 59, lives with her 24-year-old son in a small house with a zinc roof in the Lins favela in western Rio. They want to move because the home sits on a steep hill that is prone to deadly mudslides. But her son hasn’t been able to find work since finishing his military service a few years ago.  “I would leave if there was a way, but there isn’t,” said de Pena Souza, who added: “When it rains, I can’t sleep.”  The economic doldrums are clearly fueling the political comeback of former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who from 2003 to 2010 presided over much of the boom. After leaving office with approval ratings over 80 percent, da Silva’s popularity plunged as he and his party were ensnared in corruption investigations. Da Silva is appealing a conviction and nearly 10-year sentence for corruption. But he still consistently leads preference polls for next year’s presidential election.  On the campaign trail, da Silva promises both a return to better economic times and refocusing on the poor.  “Lula is not just Lula,” da Silva said at a recent rally in Rio, using the name most Brazilians call him. “It’s an idea represented by millions of men and women.

New York is investing $30 million in a 50-mile drone testing corridor between Rome and Syracuse for drone research and development. (AP Photo/Mary Esch)  ROME, N.Y. (AP) — Envisioning a day when millions of drones will buzz around delivering packages, watching crops or inspecting pipelines, a coalition is creating an airspace corridor in upstate New York where traffic management systems will be developed and unmanned aircraft can undergo safety and performance testing.  The unmanned aircraft traffic management corridor, jump-started by a $30 million state investment, will extend 50 miles (80 kilometers) west over mostly rural farmland from Griffiss International Airport, a former Air Force base in Rome that is already home to NASA-affiliated drone testing.  It will be equipped with radar and ground-based sensors to enable what Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo boasted would be “the most advanced drone testing in the country.”  The first segment of the corridor was launched last month by the Northeast UAS Airspace Integration Research Alliance, a coalition of private and public entities and academic institutions in New York and Massachusetts created to establish Griffiss as a drone industry incubator.  The airport is one of seven places around the country designated by the Federal Aviation Administration as an unmanned aircraft systems test site. Other sites are in Virginia, North Dakota, New Mexico, Texas, Nevada and Alaska.  Testing at the airport now is restricted to a five-mile radius, in part because of Federal Aviation Administration rules that normally limit flying beyond the operator’s line of sight, except in special circumstances, such as disaster area surveys. That keeps companies like Amazon and Walmart from using drones for package delivery.  Companies will be able to use the corridor to test hardware in airspace where manned aircraft also fly. Part of the concept is to help NASA to test technology that will allow the FAA to create regulations opening the national airspace to a commercial drone industry.  “Clients will eventually be able to fly beyond the visual line of sight in the corridor testing their technology,” said Tony Basile, NUAIR’s vice president for operations.  In addition to supporting development of drone air traffic control rules and systems, NUAIR helps unmanned aircraft service companies demonstrate their wares to clients and provides drone pilot training to state forest rangers, law enforcement and others.  “We’re evaluating aircraft today, but the ultimate goal is, how do we operate in a beyond-line-of-sight capability,” said Glen Davis, safety director of AIROS, a General Electric venture company that was at Griffiss this week to test a 6-foot-(1.8-meter) long unmanned helicopter for pipeline and refinery inspections.  New York officials expect the Griffiss drone research initiative to help lure tech companies to central New York, which has suffered economically with the decline of manufacturing.  Cuomo has pledged up to $250 million under his Upstate Revitalization Initiative to foster growth of the unmanned aerial vehicle industry.  A key player in that initiative is Syracuse-based Gryphon Sensors, which used $5 million in state funding to develop a van equipped with radar to spot drones up to six miles away. Gryphon developed ground-based sensors and radars that track aircraft at the NUAIR test site.  Like self-driving cars, unmanned aircraft will ultimately need onboard sensors allowing them to detect and avoid obstacles including other aircraft, Basile said.  “Once technology has gotten to that point, the sensor systems used in this corridor will be repurposed to give additional coverage around airports or other places,” he said.  Basile said it will take about a year to design the corridor, install sensor equipment and begin flight testing.",3.3734177215189876,79,"[2.0, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.0, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 0.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 1.5, 3.0, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5, 2.5, 5.0, 2.5, 2.5, 4.5, 2.5, 0.5, 2.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 2.5, 2.5, 3.0, 5.0, 3.0, 2.5, 3.5, 1.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.0, 0.5, 2.5, 4.0, 3.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 1.0, 4.5, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 1.5, 3.0, 4.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 2.5, 4.0, 2.5, 1.5, 4.5, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0]"

But Trump last week graded his response to the Puerto Rico disaster a 10 on a scale of 10.  “President Trump seems more concerned about claiming credit for a job well done than the actual situation on the ground deserves, particularly in Puerto Rico,” Leahy said. “This is the hard part of governing,” he added. “We dig in for the long haul, we stop patting ourselves on the back.”  The measure currently before the Senate contains $577 million for wildfires in the West that forced agencies to tap other reserves for firefighting accounts and FEMA money.  Republicans delayed action last year on modest requests by President Barack Obama to combat the Zika virus and help Flint, Michigan, repair its lead-tainted water system. But they are moving quickly to take care of this year’s alarming series of disasters, quickly passing a $15.3 billion relief measure last month and signaling that another installment is coming next month.  Damage is still being assessed and final cost estimates for recovering and rebuilding from this year’s hurricane season are not in yet.

Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., speaks during a television interview on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Oct. 24, 2017. Flake announced he would not run for re-election in 2018, condemning in a speech aimed at President Donald Trump the ""flagrant disregard of truth and decency"" that is undermining American democracy. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)  WASHINGTON (AP) — A pair of senators from President Donald Trump’s own Republican Party blistered him with criticism Tuesday in a dramatic day of denunciation that laid bare a GOP at war with itself. Jeff Flake of Arizona declared he would not be “complicit” with Trump and announced his surprise retirement, while Bob Corker of Tennessee declared the president “debases our nation” with constant untruths and name-calling.  Corker, too, is retiring at the end of his term, and the White House shed no tears at the prospect of the two GOP senators’ departures. A former adviser to Steve Bannon, Trump’s ex-strategic adviser, called it all “a monumental victory for the Trump movement,” and Trump himself boasted to staff members that he’d played a role in forcing the senators out.  It was a stunning rebuke of a sitting president from prominent members of his own party — and added to a chorus of criticism of Trump that has been growing louder and more public. Flake challenged his fellow senators to follow his lead, but there were few immediate signs they would.  At midafternoon, as fellow lawmakers sat in attentive silence, Flake stood at his Senate desk and delivered an emotional speech in which he dissected what he considered his party’s accommodations with Trump and said he could no longer play a role in them.  One Republican senator announces his retirement with a broadside against President Donald Trump and a second attacks the president in a series of interviews - an extraordinary day of public GOP division. (Oct. 24)  “We were not made great as a country by indulging in or even exalting our worst impulses, turning against ourselves, glorifying in the things that divide us and calling fake things true and true things fake,” he said.  Hours earlier, Corker leveled his own searing criticism of Trump in a series of interviews.  “I think the debasement of our nation will be what he’ll be remembered most for and that’s regretful,” Corker said.  A furious Trump didn’t let that pass unremarked. On Twitter, he called Corker “incompetent,” said he “doesn’t have a clue” and claimed the two-term lawmaker “couldn’t get elected dog catcher in Tennessee.”  An overstatement to be sure, but White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in regard to the impending retirements, “The people both in Tennessee and Arizona supported this president, and I don’t think that the numbers are in the favor of either of those two senators in their states and so I think this was probably the right decision.”  Away from the cameras, Trump took credit for helping force the two departures, according to a White House official and an outside adviser, who insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations.  Until Tuesday, Flake had insisted he had no plans to retire. He was raising money at a good rate and casting his re-election campaign as a test case of conservatism against Trumpism. But he made clear Tuesday he’d concluded that, for now at least, Trumpism had prevailed.  “It is clear at this moment that a traditional conservative who believes in limited government and free markets, who is devoted to free trade, who is pro-immigration, has a narrower and narrower path to nomination in the Republican Party,” he said.  Corker’s retirement plans also underscore the question of what the Republican Party will look like in years to come. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has warned that some candidates running with the backing of Trump allies could not win general elections. And even if they make it to the Senate, certain conservatives could make McConnell’s job even harder as he tries to maneuver legislation through a narrow majority that now stands at 52-48.  Steven Law, head of a McConnell-allied super PAC that supports GOP incumbents and establishment-aligned candidates, wasted no time issuing a statement declaring that Republican former state Sen. Kelli Ward, who was running against Flake with the encouragement of former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, “will not be the Republican nominee for this Senate seat in 2018.” Many fellow Republicans had expected Flake to lose the primary and hope they will now be able to recruit a stronger candidate.  There was celebration in the Bannon anti-establishment camp. Said Andy Surabian, former Bannon adviser and now senior adviser to the Great America Alliance “Today’s announcement from Sen. Flake that he would not run for re-election is a monumental win for the entire Trump movement and should serve as another warning shot to the failed Republican establishment that backed Flake and others like them that their time is up.”  Talking principle rather than politics, Flake said on the Senate floor, “We must be unafraid to stand up and speak out as if our country depends on it, because it does. I plan to spend the remaining 14 months of my Senate term doing just that.”  Earlier Corker had said of Trump, “His governing model is to divide and to attempt to bully and to use untruths.” He said that he and others in the party had attempted to intervene with Trump over the months, sometimes at the behest of White House officials, but “he’s obviously not going to rise to the occasion as president.”  “Unfortunately I think world leaders are very aware that much of what he says is untrue,” Corker said.  Same untruths from an utterly untruthful president. #AlertTheDaycareStaff — Senator Bob Corker (@SenBobCorker) October 24, 2017  In between the broadsides from Corker and Flake, Trump himself made a rare visit to the Capitol to join GOP senators for their weekly policy lunch. Senators said he did not joust with Corker or anyone else — or spend much time talking about a tax overhaul, the expected topic for the lunch.  Tax overhaul is an urgent task for Republicans who’ve failed to notch a single significant legislative achievement this year despite controlling the White House and both chambers of Congress. Trump did discuss it, yet it was hardly his focus.  Instead, senators said, he mixed in a review of accomplishments so far on the regulatory front and others. At one point, he essentially polled senators on whom he should nominate as the next Federal Reserve chairman, asking for a show of hands on various candidates. He tweeted later that he had received “Multiple standing ovations!”  McConnell sidestepped reporters’ questions about Corker’s characterization of Trump.  “We’re going to concentrate on what our agenda is, and not any of these other distractions that you all may be interested in,” he said.  However, even for Republicans who had no intention of seconding Flake’s comments, the import of the day’s developments was not lost.  “It’s counterproductive when Republicans are battling amongst themselves,” said Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.  ___  Associated Press writers Jonathan Lemire, Alan Fram and Richard Lardner contributed.",3.026315789473684,19,"[2.5, 0.5, 3.0, 1.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.0, 4.5, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 1.5, 3.5, 4.0, 2.5, 2.5, 4.0, 1.5, 4.5]"

(ABC News via AP)  WASHINGTON (AP) — A fallen soldier’s angry widow joined the stormy dispute with President Donald Trump on Monday over his response to her husband’s death, declaring that his failure to remember the soldier’s name in last week’s condolence call “made me cry.” He retorted that the call was “very respectful” and her accusation about her husband’s name simply wasn’t true.  Though Trump refused to let the new round of complaints go unanswered, he steered clear of the insults he exchanged last week with a congresswoman who had overhead the sympathy call.  The president spoke in public at two events during the day — including his awarding of the military Medal of Honor to a Vietnam-era Army medic — and made no mention of the case of Sgt. La David Johnson, one of four soldiers killed Oct. 4 in a firefight with militants tied to the Islamic State group in Niger.  In addition to criticizing Trump, Myeshia Johnson, the sergeant’s widow, also complained bitterly that she had not been able to see her husband’s body.  “I need to see him so I will know that that is my husband,” she said. “I don’t know nothing, they won’t show me a finger, a hand.”  A Pentagon spokeswoman said the military often may make a recommendation on viewing but that soldiers’ bodies are prepared and turned over to the family and its funeral director. The final decision on viewing is up to them, said spokeswoman Laura Ochoa.  Myeshia Johnson spoke for the first time in the dispute on ABC’s “Good Morning America.” In the interview, she supported critical statements last week by Rep. Frederica Wilson, who had been in the car with the widow and other relatives when Trump phoned.  “Yes, the president said that ‘he knew what he signed up for, but it hurts anyway.’ And it made me cry ’cause I was very angry at the tone of his voice and how he said he couldn’t remember my husband’s name,” Johnson said.  The president answered on Twitter soon after the interview aired, saying: “I had a very respectful conversation with the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, and spoke his name from beginning, without hesitation!”  At the Pentagon, Marine Corps Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said an investigation has still to resolve questions about the Oct. 4 firefight. They include whether the U.S. had adequate intelligence and equipment for its operation, whether there was a planning failure and why it took two days to recover Johnson’s body.  Besides Johnson’s family, members of Congress are demanding answers. Last week, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., threatened a subpoena to accelerate the flow of information.  The row over Trump’s call began last week when Wilson, a Florida Democrat, accused Trump of being callous in the conversation and Trump responded that Wilson’s account was fabricated.  I had a very respectful conversation with the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, and spoke his name from beginning, without hesitation! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2017  But Johnson backed Wilson’s account, saying that the congresswoman was a longtime friend and listened on a speakerphone in the car with family members.  Said Johnson on Monday: “I heard him stumbling on trying to remember my husband’s name, and that’s what hurt me the most, because if my husband is out here fighting for our country and he risked his life for our country why can’t you remember his name.”  The continuing dispute drew criticism from McCain, who spent more than five years in a Vietnamese prison. He said on “The View” Monday: “We should not be fighting about a brave American who lost his life.”  Confusion over what happened in Niger has dogged Trump, who was silent about the deaths for more than a week.  Asked last Monday about that silence, Trump credited himself with doing more to honor the military dead and console their families than any of his predecessors. His subsequent boast that he reaches out personally to all families of the fallen was contradicted by interviews with family members, some of whom had not heard from him.  Questions about Trump’s responses continued Monday. The family of Capt. Ben Cross of Bethel, Maine, who was one of three Marines killed in an MV-22 Osprey crash in August off the coast of Australia, received a letter from Trump on Friday, a day after his brother called out Trump.  The timing of the letter indicated “it was obviously done in an attempt to repair the political damage,” said Ryan Cross. “We think he was going through the motions.”  The administration has said protocol requires that the Pentagon and White House Military Office prepare and confirm an information packet before the president contacts grieving family members, a process that can take weeks.  A White House official said Monday that the controversy did force a look at the overall outreach efforts and prompted letters that in some cases had been held up for bureaucratic reasons.  Rep. Wilson criticized the condolence call beginning last Tuesday. She continued to assail Trump, and he fired off insulting tweets, calling her “wacky” and accusing her of secretly listening.  Johnson declined to directly address Trump on Monday. Asked if she had a message for the president, she replied: “No. I don’t have nothing to say to him.”  ___  Associated Press writer David Sharp contributed from Portland, Maine.",3.057142857142857,70,"[0.5, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 0.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 0.5, 4.5, 3.0, 0.5, 5.0, 2.5, 4.0, 2.5, 5.0, 5.0, 1.5, 3.0, 0.5, 4.0, 0.5, 5.0, 0.5, 0.5, 4.5, 4.5, 0.5, 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 3.5, 3.5, 0.5, 1.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.0, 1.5, 3.5, 0.5, 4.0, 4.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0, 0.5, 2.5, 3.0, 0.5, 4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.0, 0.5, 5.0, 0.5, 5.0, 0.5, 3.5, 2.0, 4.5, 3.5]"

Congress is looking for ways to raise revenue, and one of the methods reportedly under consideration is to limit how much pre-tax money workers can contribute to their 401(k) and similar accounts. If it were to happen, the move would strike at a way that tens of millions of Americans use to save for retirement. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File)  NEW YORK (AP) — The 401(k) may be in Washington’s crosshairs.  Congress is looking for ways to raise revenue as part of a tax overhaul plan, and one of the methods reportedly under consideration is to curtail how much pretax money workers can contribute to their 401(k) and similar accounts. Such a move would strike at a way that tens of millions of Americans use to save for retirement.  The suggestion has already run into some resistance, even if it isn’t an official policy proposal. President Donald Trump said Monday in a tweet that “There will be NO change to your 401(k). This has always been a great and popular middle class tax break that works, and it stays!”  Here’s a look at how prevalent the 401(k) has become and how it’s used:  HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ACTIVELY PARTICIPATING IN A 401(K)?  About 55 million Americans, who altogether have more than $5 trillion invested in the plans, according to the Investment Company Institute, a trade group representing mutual funds.  Roughly $19 of every $100 in U.S. retirement assets is in a 401(k) account. A decade ago, $17 of every $100 was in a 401(k). The rest is in pension funds, Individual Retirement Accounts, annuities and other investments.  ___  WHY ARE 401(k)s SO IMPORTANT?  U.S. households are increasingly in charge of saving for their own retirements.  Traditional pensions, which pay out a set amount to retirees, are growing closer to extinction. Plus, the retirement of the baby boomers is straining the Social Security trust fund, which is expected to run dry in 2034.  Enter the 401(k) account, which Congress created in 1978. It allows workers to set aside some of their pay and avoid paying even a cent of taxes on it until making withdrawals in retirement. By that time, savers may be making less in income than in their working years, which would mean they pay lower income-tax rates.  One of the big benefits of a 401(k) is that it can make saving automatic. Deductions get taken out of each paycheck. A growing number of employers are also automatically enrolling their workers into a 401(k) program and even automatically increasing their contribution rate each year, in hopes of setting workers up for better retirements.  ___  HOW ARE 401(K) ACCOUNTS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER RETIREMENT PLANS?  They allow workers to save more each year for retirement, on a tax-deferred basis. This year, for example, workers can set aside up to $18,000 in contributions. Workers aged 50 and over can contribute up to $24,000.  By comparison, the annual limit for tax-deferred contributions in an IRA is $5,500, or $6,500 for people aged 50 and above.  ___  HOW BIG IS THE TYPICAL 401(K)?  The average balance for a 401(K) was $97,700 at the end of June, according to Fidelity, which looked at 15 million participants in 22,200 plans. That’s a record, and the totals have been rising as the stock market continues to climb and workers set aside more of their pay.  Workers contributed an average of $5,850 to their 401(k) in the 12 months through June, up 4 percent from a year earlier. Proposals have reportedly discussed capping the annual pretax amount as low as $2,400.  The average IRA balance is slightly larger, at $100,200, according to Fidelity.  ___  ARE THERE ANY DOWNSIDES TO A 401(K)?  The menu of available investments isn’t always the best. Workers have filed numerous lawsuits in recent years against their employers, alleging that the 401(k) plan offers only funds that charge too-high fees or that have poor track records.  Even if good options are available, many workers feel uncomfortable making investment choices. That’s one reason employers have been steering many workers into target-date retirement funds. These all-in-one mutual funds shift from risky investments toward safer ones as the targeted year of retirement approaches.  ___  ARE 401(K) PLANS JUST FOR THE RICH?  No, but the rich can get the most benefit. Higher-income workers are able to set aside more of their pay in a 401(k) account than lower-income workers for the simple reason that they have more to save.  But an additional benefit is that the dollars that higher-income workers are deducting from their taxable income would have been taxed at a higher rate than contributions made by lower-income workers. In other words, the tax benefit of a $1,000 contribution is worth more for a higher-income worker than one made by a worker who is several tax-bracket rungs below.  ___  WHY WOULD CONGRESS CONSIDER THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE?  Washington is hoping to cut income-tax rates across the board, but the only way to do that without sending the national debt skyrocketing even higher is to raise revenue elsewhere.  By curtailing the amount of 401(k) contributions that are tax deferred, Congress would be able to reap some of those dollars now rather than waiting to tax them when they’re withdrawn decades in the future.",3.610091743119266,109,"[4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.5, 0.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.0, 1.5, 3.5, 2.5, 5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 1.5, 3.5, 3.0, 1.5, 5.0, 3.5, 0.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.0, 5.0, 1.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 2.5, 3.0, 5.0, 3.0, 5.0, 4.5, 3.0, 3.0, 3.5, 4.5, 2.0, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5, 3.0, 4.5, 4.0, 5.0, 0.5, 1.5, 4.5, 1.5, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 2.5, 5.0, 2.5, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 0.5, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 1.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 2.0, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 3.0, 4.5, 5.0, 0.5, 5.0, 2.5, 3.5, 3.0, 2.5, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.5, 4.5, 2.5, 5.0, 1.5, 4.0, 3.0, 4.5, 4.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.0]"
959,2474,10,23,2017,2017-10-23,Associated Press News,New flight paths lead to airplane noise complaints across US," Airliners began flying over Twila Lake’s bungalow-style house in a historic district three years ago, taking off every one to two minutes from the Phoenix airport and roaring over her neighborhood. It was a sudden change after rarely hearing jets in her previous 13 years in the downtown neighborhood.  Now, “it’s all day and night long,” complained the 71-year-old retiree, who said she sleeps with the television on to drown out aircraft noise. Some neighbors sold their homes and moved after the aviation highway entrance ramp was routed overhead.  The Federal Aviation Administration started revising flight paths and procedures around the United States in 2014 under its air traffic control modernization plan known as “NextGen.” The new procedures use more precise, satellite-based navigation that saves time, increases the number of planes airports can service, and reduces fuel burn and emissions.  Noise complaints exploded from San Diego to Charlotte, North Carolina, to New York as flights were concentrated at lower altitudes, in narrower paths and on more frequent schedules. The new paths often reduce the number of people exposed to noise, but those who get noise get it far more consistently.  In Phoenix, redrawn flights over vintage neighborhoods like Lake’s affect some 2,500 homes, prompting a court challenge from historic districts and the city.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Aug. 29 agreed with their assessment that the FAA was “arbitrary and capricious” in revising flight procedures. FAA officials asked for an extension, and the court this month pushed the petition deadline to Nov. 16.  Local governments and residents in more than a half-dozen other areas - including Washington’s Georgetown neighborhood and California’s Newport Beach, Laguna Beach, Orange County and Culver City - have similar petitions before the court.  Attorney Steven Taber, who represents several Southern California communities with complaints, predicted legal action over flight changes will be a continuing problem across the U.S.  Aviation experts said they don’t expect the Phoenix ruling to set a precedent for other cities, but it is forcing the FAA to be more responsive.  “We certainly view it as one of the most egregious cases of a lack of community involvement,” said Chris Oswald, vice president of safety and regulatory affairs with Airports Council International-North America. The FAA has since done more outreach elsewhere, he said.  Policy analyst Rui Neiva of the Eno Center for Transportation think tank in Washington said agency officials must find a middle ground.  “In some cases, they may have to settle on a path that is less efficient, or create several additional paths,” he said.  But David Grizzle, a former FAA chief operating officer, said it’s not possible to redesign procedures to address the problem and still reap NextGen’s technology advantages.  “There is an intrinsic issue of concentrating noise in particular places that comes with precision-based navigation that is inescapable,” he said.  FAA officials knew a decade ago some homeowners would suffer more noise because of the changes, but hoped their complaints would be offset by the people who benefited, Grizzle said. But those people haven’t spoken up.  The FAA said in a statement it is reviewing the Phoenix decision and working with residents near airports around the country through “noise roundtables” to balance community interests with needed improvements to the national airspace system.  In Phoenix, “simply reverting to previous air traffic control procedures is not viable,” the agency said. The new procedures are “interdependent,” and any changes to one would have a domino effect, it said.  FAA officials claimed a “categorical exclusion” for Phoenix, which they said allowed them to forgo the customary environmental assessment because any changes in flight procedures were not expected to have an adverse impact. When Phoenix filed a challenge, the FAA sought to have it dismissed, arguing it was not filed in a timely fashion.  The court ruled that by keeping people in the dark, the agency made it impossible for the public to submit views on the project’s potential effects - something the FAA is especially required to do for historic areas and parks.  People elsewhere also complain the FAA failed to adequately explain the planned changes or provide opportunities to comment. In some areas, people say they didn’t know changes were coming because the FAA advertised them in places people wouldn’t normally look, such as government webpages.  In the Washington metro area, Georgetown University and neighborhood groups complained the FAA left them out of the loop and failed to properly assess the effect of changes at Ronald Reagan National Airport.  Residents said that until spring 2015, departing flights traveled a straight line over the Pentagon, Arlington National Cemetery and commercial areas of Rosslyn, Virginia. Now, a major departure path routes planes alongside historic Georgetown.  Roberto Vittori said he didn’t know about the FAA’s plans when he bought his home near Georgetown University’s medical school. Vittori wrote in a legal declaration last year that he spent $12,000 on soundproof glass for the home’s double-paned windows, but it was “still inadequate to muffle the noise.”  In Maryland, residents have complained about aircraft noise from Reagan National and Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan recently ordered the state’s attorney general to prepare a lawsuit against the FAA over routes he said were making families “miserable in their own homes.”  Santa Cruz, California, residents have complained of noise from planes headed to San Francisco International Airport but said they decided to work with federal officials rather than go to court.  For some 30 years, San Francisco-bound aircraft traveled over unpopulated areas, but residents were surprised last year when planes began flying closer to their homes, Denise Stansfield said.  Through the Save our Skies Santa Cruz citizens group Stansfield founded, a committee of residents, elected officials and FAA representatives began meeting to devise less obtrusive flight procedures. The process is ongoing, but residents are optimistic.  Initially, the FAA “didn’t consider the impact for people on the ground,” group member Vicki Miller said. “I think they are reassessing.”  ___  Lowy reported from Washington.",3.335616438356164,73,"[2.5, 3.5, 2.5, 2.5, 4.0, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.0, 3.5, 1.5, 5.0, 2.0, 3.5, 4.5, 2.5, 2.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 5.0, 3.5, 2.0, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 1.0, 4.5, 3.0, 2.5, 5.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.5, 3.0, 4.0, 0.5, 0.5, 2.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.0, 5.0, 1.0, 4.0, 3.5, 2.5, 2.0, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 5.0, 2.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 0.5, 1.5, 3.0, 3.0, 5.0, 4.0]"

The New York Times reported that O’Reilly had agreed to the $32 million deal to set aside allegations that include a nonconsensual sexual relationship with former Fox analyst Lis Wiehl, bringing to six the number of harassment settlements involving him. The deal was reached a month before O’Reilly signed a contract extension and three months before O’Reilly was fired because of publicity about the cases against him.

Fox’s parent company, 21st Century Fox, is awaiting a decision by British regulators regarding its purchase of the Sky satellite television company, and the issue of Fox News’ management is being considered.  Kelly, on her NBC show Monday, refuted O’Reilly’s claims that no one had complained about him, saying Fox “was not exactly a friendly environment” for women who had stories to tell about abuse.  She said she went to Fox leaders Bill Shine, who has since resigned, and Jack Abernethy, who is now president of Fox News Network, after her memoir was published last November with her anger about O’Reilly’s suggestion that people who complained about their treatment at Fox were disloyal. Kelly had written in her book about alleged harassment by Fox’s one-time leader Roger Ailes.  “Perhaps he didn’t realize the kind of message his criticism sends to young women across the country about how men continue to view the issue of speaking out about sexual harassment,” Kelly said she wrote to her bosses.  O’Reilly’s attitude of “shaming women into shutting the hell up about harassment on the grounds that it will disgrace the company” is precisely how Fox got into the mess it was in, she said. Later Monday, she posted a copy of the email she sent to her bosses. “You’ve got a hell of a guy hosting that 8 p.m. hour,” she wrote.  Kelly said she was told O’Reilly would be spoken to and, hours later, he said on the air that people who don’t like what is happening in the workplace should leave or go to human resources. She said it’s clearly not just Fox that handles the issue of harassment badly.  “This must stop,” she said. “The abuse of women, the shaming of them, the threats, the retaliation, the silence of them after the fact — it has to stop.”  O’Reilly and Kelly’s shows once ran back-to-back on Fox’s prime lineup. Now those time slots are filled by Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity. O’Reilly, speaking Monday on the radio program hosted by another ex-Fox colleague, Glenn Beck, said he found Kelly’s comment incomprehensible.  “I don’t know why Megyn Kelly is doing what she’s doing,” he said. “I helped her dramatically in her career.”  His website posted notes penned to O’Reilly by Kelly in 2009 and 2012. In one, she thanks O’Reilly for publicizing a book written by her husband. In the other, she thanks him for the “darling body suit and snuggly” given at a baby shower. “You’ve become a dear friend (no matter what you say) and I’m grateful to have you in my life,” she wrote in the note.  O’Reilly also posted a note from Gretchen Carlson, whose lawsuit against Ailes led to his downfall. She’s been critical of O’Reilly, and of Fox allowing Hannity to bring him back on the air for an interview recently. In the undated note to O’Reilly, she wrote, “thank you for being my friend.”  Carlson’s response on Twitter to the note: “So what. Still paid $32M.”  “If you still want to think I’m a bad guy, go ahead,” O’Reilly told Beck. He said the Times’ story about the Wiehl case was designed to get keep him out of the marketplace.  “This is an attack on an American citizen, me, for political purposes,” he said. “It has done enormous damage to me and my family. It is a horror show and should never happen in this country.”  On her show, Kelly said she’s still being victimized by Fox. She said Fox’s powerful public relations chief Irena Briganti is “known for her vindictiveness” and “to this day, she pushes negative articles on certain Ailes accusers, like the one you are looking at right now.”  Briganti was not at work Monday. 21st Century Fox issued a statement saying Briganti was “a valued colleague and she has our full support.”  Kelly also interviewed former Fox anchor Juliet Huddy on her show. Huddy, who appeared with her lawyer Doug Wigdor, also settled harassment claims against O’Reilly, and said she wrestled with the idea of signing non-disclosure agreements. The one she signed prevented Huddy from giving any details about her case against O’Reilly. She said she struggled with the concept, knowing that it would help other women who feel abused if they knew there were others out there like them.  Huddy said she still isn’t working in the broadcast business after leaving Fox.",3.1560283687943262,282,"[1.5, 3.5, 1.5, 3.5, 2.0, 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 4.5, 4.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 4.5, 2.5, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.0, 2.5, 5.0, 2.5, 2.5, 1.5, 2.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.0, 2.5, 4.5, 1.5, 4.0, 2.5, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 1.5, 0.5, 4.5, 4.0, 5.0, 3.0, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5, 5.0, 2.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 2.5, 0.5, 0.5, 4.5, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0, 3.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.5, 4.5, 2.0, 4.0, 2.5, 5.0, 1.0, 4.0, 3.5, 4.5, 3.0, 3.5, 3.0, 2.5, 5.0, 3.0, 3.0, 4.5, 4.0, 0.5, 1.5, 3.0, 1.5, 5.0, 3.5, 2.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.0, 1.0, 3.0, 1.0, 1.5, 3.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 1.5, 4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 3.5, 0.5, 3.5, 3.0, 3.5, 2.5, 5.0, 3.0, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.0, 2.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 1.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 2.0, 3.5, 4.5, 0.5, 4.0, 1.5, 5.0, 5.0, 3.5, 5.0, 4.0, 2.5, 4.5, 4.5, 2.5, 4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.5, 1.0, 3.0, 3.5, 0.5, 2.0, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.0, 0.5, 0.5, 3.5, 4.5, 0.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.0, 2.5, 5.0, 1.5, 3.0, 5.0, 3.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.0, 1.0, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 0.5, 2.5, 0.5, 4.0, 1.5, 4.5, 2.5, 5.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0, 3.0, 4.0, 4.0, 2.5, 3.5, 0.5, 4.5, 0.5, 4.5, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 0.5, 5.0, 2.5, 3.0, 5.0, 3.5, 2.5, 4.5, 1.5, 3.5, 4.0, 2.5, 2.5, 1.5, 2.5, 4.5, 2.5, 4.0, 2.5, 2.0, 3.5, 5.0, 1.5, 2.5, 2.5, 3.5, 3.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.0, 2.0, 3.0, 1.0, 4.5, 3.0, 5.0, 0.5, 2.0, 0.5, 4.5, 2.0, 3.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 1.0, 5.0, 0.5, 4.0, 4.5, 0.5, 4.5, 0.5, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 3.0, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 2.0, 5.0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 3.0]"

CalFire spokesman Daniel Berlant said Monday, Oct. 23, 2017, the estimate of homes and structures destroyed was boosted from 6,900 late last week to 8,400 as officials neared completion of their damage assessment. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — A non-partisan federal watchdog says climate change is already costing U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars each year, with those costs expected to rise as devastating storms, floods, wildfires and droughts become more frequent in the coming decades.  A Government Accountability Office report released Monday said the federal government has spent more than $350 billion over the last decade on disaster assistance programs and losses from flood and crop insurance. That tally does not include the massive toll from this year’s wildfires and three major hurricanes, expected to be among the most costly in the nation’s history.  The Senate on Monday gave preliminary approval to a $36.5 billion hurricane relief package that would provide Puerto Rico with a much-needed infusion of cash and keep the federal flood insurance program from running out of money to pay claims from hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. That’s on top of another $15.3 billion aid package approved last month.  The report predicts these costs will only grow in the future, averaging a budget busting $35 billion each year by 2050 — a figure that recent history would suggest is a conservative estimate.  “Climate change impacts are already costing the federal government money, and these costs will likely increase over time as the climate continues to change,” the report said.  Calculating just how much of the spending from disasters is directly attributable to the changing climate is not possible, the report’s authors conclude, but the trend is clear: “The impacts and costs of extreme events — such as floods, drought and other events — will increase in significance as what are considered rare events become more common and intense because of climate change.”  The federal government doesn’t effectively plan for these recurring costs, the report said, classifying the financial exposure from climate-related costs as “high risk.”  “The federal government has not undertaken strategic government-wide planning to manage climate risks by using information on the potential economic effects of climate change to identify significant risks and craft appropriate federal responses,” the study said. “By using such information, the federal government could take the initial step in establishing government-wide priorities to manage such risks.”  GAO undertook the study following a request from Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.  “This nonpartisan GAO report Senator Cantwell and I requested contains astonishing numbers about the consequences of climate change for our economy and for the federal budget in particular,” said Collins. “In Maine, our economy is inextricably linked to the environment. We are experiencing a real change in the sea life, which has serious implications for the livelihoods of many people across our state, including those who work in our iconic lobster industry.”  The report’s authors reviewed 30 government and academic studies examining the national and regional impacts of climate change. They also interviewed 28 experts familiar with the strengths and limitations of the studies, which rely on future projections of climate impacts to estimate likely costs.  The report says the fiscal impacts of climate change are likely to vary widely by region. The Southeast is at increased risk because of coastal property that could be swamped by storm surge and sea level rise. The Northeast is also under threat from storm surge and sea level rise, though not as much as the Southeast.  The Midwest and Great Plains are susceptible to decreased crop yields, the report said. The West is expected to see increased drought, wildfires and deadly heatwaves.  Advance copies were provided to the White House and the Environmental Protection Agency, which provided no official comments for inclusion in the GAO report.  Requests for comment from The Associated Press also received no response on Monday.  President Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax, announcing his intent to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accords and revoke Obama-era initiatives to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Trump has also appointed officials such as EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, all of whom question the scientific consensus that carbon released into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels is the primary driver of global warming.  Earlier this month Trump nominated Kathleen Hartnett White of Texas to serve as his top environmental adviser at the White House. She has credited the fossil fuel industry with “vastly improved living conditions across the world” and likened the work of mainstream climate scientists to “the dogmatic claims of ideologues and clerics.”  White, who works at a conservative think tank that has received funding from fossil-fuel companies, holds academic degrees in East Asian studies and comparative literature.  ___  Follow Associated Press environmental writer Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck  ___  Submit a confidential tip to The Associated Press at https://www.ap.org.tips",2.9,5,"[4.0, 0.5, 5.0, 0.5, 4.5]"
962,2483,10,23,2017,2017-10-23,Associated Press News,Study: NYC could see bad flooding every 5 years," Within the next three decades, floods that used to strike the New York City area only once every 500 years could occur every five years, according to a new scientific study released just days before the fifth anniversary of Superstorm Sandy.  The study, performed by researchers at several universities and published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, primarily blames the predicted change on sea-level rise caused by global warming.  “This is kind of a warning,” said Andra Garner, a Rutgers University scientist and study co-author. “How are we going to protect our coastal infrastructure?”  The researchers based their analysis on multiple models that factored in predictions for sea level rise and possible changes in the path of future hurricanes.  Many of the models had a dose of good news for the nation’s largest city: Climate changes may mean that storms are more violent, but are also likely to swing further off-shore, meaning storm surge heights aren’t likely to increase substantially through 2300.  However, rising sea levels could mean that floods of 7.4 feet (2.25 meters) or more that struck the New York city area roughly once every 500 years before 1800, and which occur roughly every 25 years now, could happen once every five years between 2030 and 2045.  Researchers made no recommendations on what public officials or others should do to prepare.  “The idea is this kind of study we hope will provide information that people making those kinds of decisions can use,” Garner said. “We know that when Sandy hit in 2012, of course, subways, tunnels flooded, power was knocked out, parts of the city were just really devastated so studies like this provide some warning.”  Other researchers included scientists from Penn State University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton University, Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, the University of Massachusetts Amherst and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.  The researchers said there is scientific consensus that global sea level will rise in the coming centuries, although it is not certain how high. They cautioned that sea-level rise at New York City could exceed 8 feet by the end of the century if, in a high-emissions future, the West Antarctic ice sheet rapidly melts.  The study expects about 5 inches to 11 inches (12.7 centimeters to 27.9 centimeters) of sea-level rise likely in New York City between 2000 and 2030.  The study examined sea level rise through the year 2300.  “I think the study is valid, but year 2300 is a long way off,” said Billy Sweet, an oceanographer for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who was not involved in it. “What is more certain is the amount of sea level rise likely to occur in the next 50 to 100 years or so and that storm surges from nor’easters and hurricanes will continue to pose a risk for New York City.”  Hurricane Sandy merged with two other weather systems into an unusual storm that devastated the oceanfront coastline and caused catastrophic flooding in New York and cities in New Jersey on Oct. 29, 2012. It was blamed for at least 182 deaths and $65 billion in damage in the U.S.  State and city officials in New York say they are planning numerous projects to guard against future flooding, including fortifying utilities and transit facilities, and note other projects are still in the design stage.

According to as study released on Monday, Oct. 23, 2017 by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the way a mother responds to her crying baby seems to be programmed into her brain circuits. Researchers found that mothers across many cultures tend to react the same way to an infant’s cry, and brain scans showed that this distressing sound activates circuitry associated with such responses. (AP Photo/Joerg Sarbach)  NEW YORK (AP) — Crying babies push the same “buttons” in their mothers’ brains no matter what their culture, a new study suggests.  The research found that mothers in 11 countries tend to react the same way to their bawling child — by picking up and talking to the baby — and that the way mothers respond seems to be programmed into their brain circuits.  An author of the study said he hopes the results will spur others to study brain responses in women who mistreat their children. Crying is a common trigger for abuse, said Marc Bornstein of the government’s National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, Maryland.  The new results were released Monday by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  The researchers analyzed videotapes of 684 mothers in 11 countries as they interacted with their infants, who were around 5 months old. The observations were done in Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Cameroon, France, Kenya, Israel, Italy, Japan, South Korea and the United States.  Analysis showed that the mothers were likely to respond to crying by picking up and talking to the infant. But they were not likely to use other responses such as kissing, distracting, feeding or burping the child. Results were similar across the various countries.  Next, researchers thought about what parts of the brain would likely be involved in the responses they saw. They focused on circuitry that’s activated when a person plans to do or say something, other circuitry that could be involved in figuring out the meaning of a cry and on brain parts known to play critical roles in maternal caregiving.  With brain scans, they found those brain areas were activated when 43 first-time mothers in the U.S. listened to recordings of their infants crying. Fifty mothers in China and Italy showed a similar result, with the Chinese moms showing different brain responses when they heard other sounds like infants laughing or babbling.  But brains of six Italian women who were not mothers reacted differently to crying, Bornstein said in an email.  “Mothers, based on their personal experience, could easily have their brains shaped in a matter of a few months to be especially sensitive” to an infant’s cry, perhaps because of hormonal changes that occur with parenting, he wrote.  In fact, one contribution of Bornstein’s work is that suggestion that brain development can continue beyond young adulthood, with motherhood as a key stimulus, commented Yale University researcher Linda Mayes, who did not participate in the study.  Helena Rutherford of Yale, who also did not participate in the study, said the brain findings make sense, and that the study was significant for showing consistency across cultures in those responses and the behavior of the mothers.  ___  Follow Malcolm Ritter at @MalcolmRitter His recent work can be found at http://tinyurl.com/RitterAP",3.9,15,"[2.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 1.5]"
987,2530,10,24,2017,2017-10-24,Associated Press News,Senate GOP moves to repeal consumer rule," The Republican-led Senate narrowly voted Tuesday to repeal a banking rule that would let consumers band together to sue their bank or credit card company to resolve financial disputes.  Vice President Mike Pence cast the final vote to break a 50-50 tie. The banking industry had been lobbying hard to roll back the regulation from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The bureau had moved to ban most types of mandatory arbitration clauses found in the fine print of agreements consumers often enter into when opening a checking account or getting a credit card.  The vote reflects the effort of the Trump administration and congressional Republicans to undo regulations that the GOP argues harms the free market. The measure now moves to President Donald Trump’s desk for his signature. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president applauded the vote.  “The rule would harm our community banks and credit unions by opening the door to frivolous lawsuits by special interest trial lawyers,” Sanders said.  Democratic lawmakers said the CFPB’s rule would have given consumers more leverage to stop companies from financial wrongdoing. They cited the sales practices at Wells Fargo and the security breach at credit company Equifax as examples of misdeeds protected through forced arbitration.  “So who does forced arbitration help? Wall Street banks and other huge corporations that never pay the price for cheating working people,” said Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio.  Richard Cordray, director of the consumer bureau, said: “Tonight’s vote is a giant setback for every consumer in this country. Wall Street won and ordinary people lost. This vote means the courtroom doors will remain closed for groups of people seeking justice and relief when they are wronged by a company.”  Republicans said the arbitration system has worked “wonderfully” for consumers. They said the payouts for the average consumer in arbitration cases are generally much larger and come more quickly than when compared to the relief gained through class-action lawsuits.  “The effort to try to characterize this as some devious system that has been created to try to stop consumers from having access to fairness is simply false,” said Sen. Mike Crapo, the Republican chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. “We have a very fair system that has been working for over 100 years in this country.”  Crapo said the average pay-out for consumers in class-action lawsuits against financial companies was just $32, but lawyers stood to make millions.  Democrats argued that consumers generally don’t have the time and means to pursue claims in arbitration, and since most disputes revolve around small amounts, they typically just give up. They said banks and other financial firms know that in the end they won’t have pay a real price for taking advantage of a consumer.  But class-actions would serve as a powerful tool for consumers, they said.  “Once again, we’re helping the powerful against the powerless,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., as the Senate neared the vote, sensing the Democrats would lose.  Two Republicans sided with Democratic lawmakers to keep the rule — Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and John Kennedy of Louisiana.  The advocacy group Consumers Union and several veterans groups, including the American Legion, lobbied to keep the rule. They said consumers would still have the option to use arbitration to resolve a dispute, if both parties want to go that route.  “Without the CFPB rule, consumers can be forced into a rigged system where they have no recourse. It’s a disgrace,” said Linda Lipsen, CEO of the American Association for Justice, an advocacy group that works to improve the legal system.  The American Bankers Association cheered the Senate vote. “Today’s vote puts consumers first rather than class-action lawyers,” said Rob Nichols, the group’s president and chief executive officer.",3.7,70,"[3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.5, 1.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 1.5, 4.5, 2.5, 0.5, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 2.5, 5.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.0, 2.5, 2.5, 5.0, 4.5, 1.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 3.0, 4.5, 5.0, 2.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.0, 3.0, 3.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0, 1.5, 5.0, 3.0, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5]"

Ten of the building's 11 floors are now devoted to retail. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan)  NEW YORK (AP) — Lord & Taylor’s flagship store in Manhattan, known for its holiday displays along Fifth Avenue, is being sold to the office space sharing company WeWork.  The nearly 100-year-old building will be converted to WeWork headquarters, with less than a quarter of the space remaining for a Lord & Taylor store. Right now, 10 of the building’s 11 floors are devoted to retail.  WeWork attracts millennials who are looking to share office space, a consumer segment that Lord & Taylor owner Hudson’s Bay and other department stores want to attract. So store executives expect the stores to benefit from WeWork members going in and out of the building, and hopes they’ll be shopping.  “This is a sign of the future,” said Faith Hope Consolo, chairman of the retail group at Douglass Elliman Real Estate. She predicted that other department stores will likely lease some of their space to corporate groups that cater to millennials. “They’re building their own traffic generators.”  Lord & Taylor will keep the whole building with its usual operations through next year’s holiday season. And the holiday displays will go on this year and next year, the company said. It didn’t say what happens beyond that. Lord & Taylor was the first to create Christmas windows for sheer entertainment, rather than for selling merchandise. It also pioneered the animated window display back in 1938.  While shoppers may have been drawn to Lord & Taylor’s windows, Consolo said she wasn’t sure how much they were shopping. Many would buy cosmetics on the first floor but didn’t often venture to the upper floors, she said. Hudson’s Bay Co., which owns Lord & Taylor, Saks Fifth Avenue and Canada’s Hudson’s Bay, said in June it was cutting 2,000 jobs in North America as it shaves costs and tries to adjust to changes in how people shop.  The $850 million sale announced Tuesday is part of a plan by Hudson’s Bay to pare down debt and reinvigorate sales. Company officials declined to say what the redesigned Lord & Taylor store of about 150,000 square feet will look like.  Richard Baker, chairman of Hudson’s Bay, told The Associated Press that WeWork will also lease space in the upper floors in three of the company main stores — Hudson’s Bay stores in Toronto and Vancouver, Canada, as well as its Galeria Kaufhof in Frankfurt, Germany.  Department stores have been struggling to follow their customers online, with many closing stores and selling lucrative real estate. Big chains like Macy’s had been under pressure from shareholders to get more value out of their real estate holdings. But Consolo agreed with Baker that the Hudson’s Bay deal with WeWork is a dramatic change in how retailers are trying to capitalize on their real estate.  “We definitely think there is a future for department stores for people who reinvest in the business,” Baker said.  On Friday, Hudson’s Bay had said that CEO Jerry Storch would step down at the end of the month.  ____  Follow Anne D’Innocenzio at http://www.Twitter.com/adinnocenzio",3.4741379310344827,58,"[3.0, 2.5, 4.5, 4.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 1.5, 3.0, 1.5, 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 3.5, 2.5, 0.5, 4.0, 0.5, 5.0, 3.0, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 5.0, 3.5, 3.0, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.0, 4.0, 3.5, 2.5, 2.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.0, 3.5, 3.0, 1.5, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5]"

And with more people coming in, McDonald’s said some also bought pricier burgers stuffed with crispy onions, kale or guacamole, which helped sales.  “We are serving more customers, more often,” said CEO Steve Easterbrook.  McDonald’s has been offering deals to fight off competition from other low-priced chains. It plans to offer more cheap eats next year, with items priced at $1, $2 and $3, the company said Tuesday.  Bill Fahy, an analyst at Moody’s, said the boost in sales is “a good indication that the company’s various initiatives are resonating well with consumers.”  Besides discounts, McDonald’s has also been tinkering with its menu as more people shun processed foods. It removed artificial preservatives from its nuggets and it plans to use fresh beef in Quarter Pounder burgers next year. And it has been modernizing its restaurants by adding mobile ordering and offering delivery through the UberEats app. About 5,000 of its nearly 14,000 U.S. locations will have delivery by the end of the year.  The company’s McCafe drinks “performed well,” said Chris Kempczinski, who oversees McDonald’s U.S. business, but he didn’t provide any numbers. The company rolled out espresso drinks, such as cappuccino and caramel macchiato, during the quarter and plans to remodel McCafes in its restaurants next year.  “McCafe can be a significant growth platform for us in the future,” Kempczinski said.  Worldwide, McDonald’s sales rose 6 percent at existing restaurants, the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said.  Overall, McDonald’s reported net income of $1.88 billion, or $2.32 per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30. That’s up from $1.28 billion, or $1.50 per share, in the same period a year ago. Adjusted earnings came to $1.76 per share, a penny above what analysts expected, according to Zacks Investment Research.  Revenue fell 10 percent to $5.75 billion, missing analyst expectations of $5.8 billion. The company said it brought in less revenue as it switched more stores from company-owned restaurants to ones owned by franchisees, especially in China and Hong Kong.

995,2543,10,25,2017,2017-10-25,Associated Press News,Analysis: Can the GOP survive the Trump presidency?," Can the traditional Republican Party survive the presidency of Donald Trump?  That existential question, which has nagged at Republicans since Trump’s stunning election one year ago, flared up anew Tuesday with Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake’s announcement that he is retiring from Congress. One of the GOP’s most consistent critics of the president, Flake was facing a tough primary challenge in next year’s election from at least one candidate with the backing of some Trump allies.  “There may not be a place for a Republican like me in the current Republican climate or the current Republican Party,” said Flake, a conservative who has worked with Democrats on issues like immigration and the Obama administration’s detente with Cuba.  The senator’s dour assessment of his future in the Republican Party gave voice to worries that have gripped the GOP heading into the midterm elections. Trump has shown little loyalty to some sitting senators, and has openly squabbled with Flake and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Some of the president’s ardent supporters — led by former White House senior adviser Steve Bannon — are actively courting GOP primary challengers who are more willing to buck the Republican establishment in Washington than line up behind its leaders.  President Donald Trump arrived at the U.S. Capitol to speak with members of the Republican caucus amid a bitter dispute with fellow Republican Sen. Bob Corker, who has been speaking out against the president's leadership skills. (Oct. 24)  Andy Surabian, a senior adviser for the pro-Trump group Great America Alliance, said Flake’s retirement is part of a trend and “should serve as another warning shot to the failed Republican establishment that backed Flake and others like them that their time is up.”  To be sure, intra-party divisions are hardly new for the GOP, which has struggled for years to reconcile its more moderate, pro-business wing with the growing crop of populists and nationalists that ultimately fueled Trump’s political rise. Trump’s election may have left Republicans with control of both the White House and Congress but it did nothing to heal the divisions. If anything, Trump — a former Democrat with no ideological mooring to conservative principles or deep ties to GOP leaders — has exacerbated the gulf between millions of GOP voters and the congressional leaders sent to Washington to represent them.  Peter Wehner, a Trump critic who served in President George W. Bush’s White House, said there’s a “struggle going on for the soul of conservatism and the Republican Party.” He urged more traditional Republicans to stay and fight for their principles instead of fleeing — though he left open the prospect that it’s a fight they ultimately may not win.  “If this party is defined by Donald Trump and Steve Bannon, then a lot of these people aren’t going to want to be a part of that party anyway,” Wehner said.  The anti-establishment forces already had one victory under their belt after firebrand jurist Roy Moore defeated incumbent Sen. Luther Strange in the Alabama GOP primary last month. Moore is considered an outlier among Republicans and hardly a guaranteed vote for McConnell if he lands in the Senate next year.  Flake’s comments Tuesday from the Senate floor came hours after Sen. Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican who has also decided not to seek re-election, declared Trump was “debasing” the United States with untruths and name-calling. Last week, Sen. John McCain lamented a climate of “half-baked, spurious nationalism” and Bush bemoaned “bullying and prejudice in our public life” — comments that appeared to be veiled criticism of Trump, though neither man mentioned the president by name.  Privately, many more Republican officials have raised deep concerns about the direction Trump is pulling the party, both on policy and tone. He’s pulled the GOP to the right on immigration only to raise the prospect of making a deal with Democrats to allow young people brought to the U.S. illegally as children to stay in the country. He’s withdrawn the U.S. from a major Pacific Rim trade pact and threatened to pull out of a long-standing deal with Canada and Mexico. The president has also drawn open support from some white nationalists, a reality that was magnified after he equivocated in his response to clashes between white supremacists and counter-protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, this summer.  But aside from occasional criticism of Trump’s tweets or most callous comments, most Republican office holders have stayed silent, in part out of fear of alienating the president’s supporters. A handful of House Republicans have taken the same path as Flake and Corker, announcing plans to retire rather than run for re-election in competitive districts.  Trent Lott, the former Republican Senate majority leader from Mississippi, blamed much of the GOP discontent on the fact that even with a Republican in the White House, the party has been unable to make good on its promises to voters. Efforts to repeal “Obamacare” have failed in embarrassing fashion. Many see the current debate over a tax overhaul package as their last best chance for a legislative breakthrough before the midterms and predict sweeping losses for the GOP if a bill doesn’t pass.  But Lott, too, said the solution for conservatives is to stay in Trump’s Republican Party, not walk away,  “You don’t complain that there’s not room for you in your party, you make room,” he said.  _  Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC",3.4,10,"[5.0, 2.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.0, 4.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.0, 3.5]"

Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, walks to a closed-door security briefing at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, Oct. 25, 2017. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)  PHOENIX (AP) — U.S. Sen. Jeff Flake’s decision to bow out of a re-election fight could spur a rush of other Republican candidates who hope to take on his only announced challenger in the Arizona primary next year.  The freshman senator’s decision came after months of saying he expected a tough primary and general election but believed he could win. Behind the scenes, though, a drumbeat of polling showed him badly damaged by comments he made about President Donald Trump in a book released over the summer and an ongoing battle with his party’s leader that began before last year’s election.  Flake faced a challenge from former state Sen. Kelli Ward, who failed in her effort to beat Sen. John McCain last year but has gained traction this year. Former Trump strategist Steve Bannon attended a fundraiser last week for Ward, who has embraced the anti-establishment, anti-incumbent wing of the party driven by Trump with help from Bannon.  But mainstream Republicans in Arizona believe Ward cannot beat U.S. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, a moderate Democrat who is the only well-known candidate running from her party. They have been searching for another GOP candidate who can draw support from Trump populists, and Flake’s decision to step aside opens the door. In the background, the White House also has been seeking another candidate.  Flake’s departure has further raised the stakes for what is sure to be a bitter and expensive election battle next year in Arizona as the GOP fights to hold on to a seat and the Democrats seek an opening to pick one up.  Ward discounts talk that she’s unelectable, saying people are rallying behind her.  “The people who are dismissive, some of them have sour grapes because they didn’t get in at the right time to be able to build the organization that I’ve built,” she said before Flake’s announcement.  Despite the party turmoil, Ward and other potential Republican candidates benefit from Arizona’s conservatism. Democrats in recent elections have hoped to make inroads, most recently when Hillary Clinton poured money and resources into the state last year only to lose by 4 percentage points. Republicans also hold every statewide office and a majority in the Legislature.  Trump boasted Wednesday of his popularity in Arizona as he ridiculed Flake.  “So, look, (Flake’s) poll numbers are terrible,” Trump said. “He’s done terribly for the great people of Arizona, a state that likes Donald Trump very much as even you will admit. And he would have never won. In fact, even in the primary, he’s way down in the primary.”  The names of other potential GOP challengers in the Senate race have been floated for months, but none has entered the race. They include state university regent Jay Heiler; former state GOP chairman Robert Graham; state Treasurer and 2016 Trump campaign chief operating officer Jeff DeWit; and Reps. Paul Gosar and Trent Franks.  The other three GOP members of Arizona’s House delegation could be wild cards — David Schweikert, Andy Biggs and Martha McSally.  A spokesman for Republican Gov. Doug Ducey said he was “absolutely not” considering running for Senate.  Republican political consultants in Arizona are split on whether there will truly be a flood of candidates.  “Somehow they all seem unlikely to me,” Constantin Querard, a top campaign consultant, said of those already in the mix. “Because if you were not going to run against a mortally wounded candidate with the support of the president and millions of dollars of outside spending, why would you suddenly be interested in the race without all of those things?”  Another longtime Republican campaign consultant, who conducted polling showing Flake in bad trouble, isn’t so sure. Chuck Coughlin said a candidate who can draw support from the pillars of the GOP establishment in Arizona — Flake, McCain, Ducey and former Gov. Jan Brewer — would be the one to take on Ward.  “The question is, who can most closely thread the needle there between Trump, McCain, Flake, Brewer, the current governor,” Coughlin said. “Who is that?”  “One thing I’d guarantee you is Kelli Ward will face a primary opponent, there’s no doubt in my mind on that,” he added.  Another potential problem for Arizona Republicans is the health of McCain, who was diagnosed this summer with an aggressive form of brain cancer and acknowledges his prognosis is poor. A vacancy in McCain’s seat before April means a second Senate race would be on the 2018 ballot.  Flake told The Associated Press as recently this month that he was in the race to win and discounted both Ward and Sinema.  By Tuesday, things were different for Flake.  “If I could run the kind of race I’d like to run and believe I could win a Republican primary, I might go forward,” he told reporters at the U.S. Capitol after his announcement. “These days, it seems that unless you’re on every policy the president has, then somehow you’re not a conservative.”  Flake is a throwback Arizona conservative, with strong small government credentials but a libertarian streak along the lines of the late Sen. Barry Goldwater. He sparred with the president over free trade, which he supports, immigration reform and opening relations with Cuba.  Those positions put him in the crosshairs of Trump and the grass-roots populists he courts.  ___  This story has been corrected to show that Rep.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)  WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump and fellow Republicans latched onto revelations tying Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign to a dossier of allegations about his ties to Russia. The president said Wednesday it was a “disgrace” that Democrats had helped pay for research that produced the document.  “It’s just really — it’s a very sad commentary on politics in this country,” Trump said in addressing reporters one day after news reports revealed that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, for several months last year, helped fund research that ultimately ended up in the dossier.  The document, compiled by a former British spy and alleging a compromised relationship between Trump and the Kremlin, has emerged this year as a political flashpoint. Law enforcement officials have worked to corroborate its claims. James Comey, FBI director at the time, advised Trump about the existence of the allegations, and the ex-spy who helped assemble the document, Christopher Steele, has been questioned as part of an ongoing probe into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump camp.  President Donald Trump has described as ""sad,"" reporting that says Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and the DNC helped pay for political research over his ties to Russia. Trump also insists there is ""great unity,"" within the GOP. (Oct. 25)  Trump has derided the document as “phony stuff” and “fake news” and portrayed himself Wednesday as an aggrieved party, posting on Twitter a quote he said was from Fox News that referred to him as “the victim.” The new disclosure about the dossier’s origins is likely to fuel complaints by Trump and his supporters that the document is merely a collection of salacious and uncorroborated claims.  “Well, I think it’s very sad what they’ve done with this fake dossier,” Trump said Wednesday, adding without elaboration that “they paid a tremendous amount of money.” He contended that Democrats had initially denied any connection to the document, but now, “they admitted it, and they’re embarrassed by it.”  Separately Wednesday, the editor of Wikileaks confirmed that his group was approached by Cambridge Analytica, a data firm working for Trump’s campaign during the 2016 election.  Julian Assange told The Associated Press that Wikileaks received a “request for information” from Cambridge Analytica. That request, which Assange would not specify, came prior to last November and was rejected. Assange’s comments came after The Daily Beast reported that Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix reached out to Assange during the presidential campaign about the possible release of 33,000 of Hillary Clinton’s missing emails. Those emails have never been publicly released.  A spokesman for Cambridge Analytica did not respond to a request for comment. Robert Mercer, a billionaire Trump supporter, is a backer of Cambridge Analytica. Former White House strategist Steve Bannon served as a vice president at the company before joining the administration.  Two people familiar with the newly disclosed dossier matter, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential client matters, told AP the funding arrangement was brokered in the spring of 2016 by a law firm representing the Clinton campaign and the DNC and that it lasted until right before Election Day. The final memo included in the dossier, a version of which was published online by Buzzfeed in January, is dated December 2016, or after the arrangement had ended.  In March of that year, the person said, the law firm of Perkins Coie was approached by Fusion GPS, a political research firm that had already begun research work on Trump on behalf of an unidentified client during the GOP primary. Fusion GPS expressed interest in continuing to create opposition research on Trump, and Perkins Coie engaged it in April 2016 “to perform a variety of research services during the 2016 election cycle,” according to a letter from the law firm’s general counsel that was obtained by AP.  The identity of the original client has not been revealed, and one of the people who spoke to AP said the law firm did not know who it was. Trump, however, hinted Wednesday that he might know the identity and that it could eventually become public.  “I have one name in mind,” the president said.  It’s unclear what Fusion GPS had dug up by the time the law firm hired it, or how much money was involved in the transaction. The Perkins Coie attorney who helped create the arrangement, Marc Elias, did not immediately return an email seeking comment, and representatives of Fusion GPS declined to comment. The Washington Post first reported the funding deal.  The Clinton campaign paid more than $5.6 million to Perkins Coie, recording the expenditures as simply “legal services,” according to Federal Election Commission records. The DNC also paid the law firm more than $2.9 million, nearly all of which was reported as “legal and compliance consulting.” The DNC did report paying the firm $66,500 for research consulting.  The new disclosure placed fresh attention on the world of opposition research and the techniques that political campaigns employ. Trump Jr.’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., received public scrutiny when it was revealed in July that he had met one year earlier with Russians at Trump Tower after being told he would be receiving damaging information on Clinton. In that case, publicly released emails show that Trump Jr. had been told the information was part of a Russian government effort to aid his father.  That June 2016 meeting is being investigated by Robert Mueller, the Justice Department’s special counsel leading an investigation into whether Trump campaign aides coordinated with Russia to influence the outcome of the election.  In a statement Tuesday night, a DNC spokeswoman said the chairman, Tom Perez, was not part of the decision-making and was unaware that Perkins Coie was working with Fusion GPS.  “But let’s be clear, there is a serious federal investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia, and the American public deserves to know what happened,” the statement said.  Former Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said on Twitter that he regretted not knowing about Steele’s hiring before the election, and that had he known, “I would have volunteered to go to Europe and try to help him.”  “I have no idea what Fusion or Steele were paid, but if even a shred of that dossier ends up helping Mueller, it will prove money well spent,” he wrote in another tweet.  ___  Associated Press writers Chad Day, Ken Thomas and Jill Colvin contributed to this report.  ___  Read the letter: http://apne.ws/UK0Ojir",3.1,20,"[1.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 2.5, 0.5, 2.5, 2.5, 1.0, 0.5, 3.0, 2.5, 4.5, 3.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.0]"

He was 85. (NASA via AP)  PHOENIX (AP) — Paul Weitz, a retired NASA astronaut who commanded the first flight of the space shuttle Challenger and also piloted the Skylab in the early 1970s, has died. He was 85.  Weitz died at his retirement home in Flagstaff, Arizona, on Monday, said Laura Cutchens of the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation. No cause of death was given.  A NASA biography says Weitz was among the class of 19 astronauts who were chosen in April 1966. He served as command module pilot on the first crew of the orbiting space laboratory known as Skylab during a 28-day mission in 1973.  Weitz also commanded the first launch of the shuttle Challenger in April 1983. The five-day mission took off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida and landed at Edwards Air Force Base in California. The Challenger was destroyed and seven crew members killed during its 10th launch on January 28, 1986.  In all, he logged 793 hours in space and retired as deputy director of the Johnson Space Center in May 1994.  Weitz was born in Erie, Pennsylvania, on July 25, 1932, and graduated from Pennsylvania State University with a degree in aeronautical engineering in 1954, according to NASA.  He then joined the Navy, serving on a destroyer before being chosen for flight training and earning his wings as a Naval Aviator in September 1956. He served in various naval squadrons, including service in Vietnam, before joining the Astronaut Corps.  According to the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation, Weitz returned to the Navy after his mission on Skylab and retired as a captain in July 1976 after serving 22 years. He then came out of retirement at age 51 to re-join NASA.  “Paul Weitz’s name will always be synonymous with the space shuttle Challenger. But he also will be remembered for defying the laws of gravity - and age,” said Curtis Brown, board chairman of the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation and an astronaut and veteran of six space flights. “Before it became commonplace to come out of retirement, Paul was a pioneer. He proved 51 was just a number.”  The foundation is supported by astronauts from the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Skylab, Space Shuttle and Space Station programs and annually provides scholarships for 45 students.

New Zealand's incoming government is hoping to make the nation greener by planting 100 million trees each year, ensuring the electricity grid runs entirely from renewable energy, and spending more money on cycle ways and rail transport. (AP Photo/Nick Perry)  WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — New Zealand’s incoming government is hoping to make the nation greener by planting 100 million trees each year, ensuring the electricity grid runs entirely from renewable energy, and spending more money on cycle ways and rail transport.  Jacinda Ardern, who takes over as prime minister this week, on Tuesday outlined agreements her Labour Party reached with other political parties joining them in the new government.  In addition to the environmental initiatives, Ardern also outlined plans to raise the minimum wage, stop foreigners from buying existing homes, and possibly change how New Zealand’s Reserve Bank operates.  The 37-year-old will be New Zealand’s youngest leader in more than 150 years and hopes to take the country on a more liberal path following nine years of rule by the conservative National Party.  “I don’t need to be influenced on climate change,” she said. “It will sit at the heart of what this government does.”  Ardern’s plan is for New Zealand to reduce its net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by the year 2050.  Some of the targets will require only incremental changes. New Zealand already generates about 85 percent of its electricity from renewable sources including hydroelectric, geothermal and wind. Ardern plans to increase that to 100 percent by 2035, in part by investigating whether solar panels can be used atop schools.  She said the country will need to double the amount of trees it plants each year, a goal she said was “absolutely achievable” by using land that was marginal for farming animals. Her plans also call for the government’s vehicle fleet to be green within a decade.  Not everybody is happy with the plans. Many farmers are worried they will be required to pay more if they are absorbed into an emissions trading scheme.  “There is concern that if this should happen, New Zealand will become less competitive with other food-producing nations,” said Katie Milne, the president of advocacy group Federated Farmers.  The government also plans to raise the minimum wage to 20 New Zealand dollars ($14) per hour over the next few years, a 27 percent increase over its current level. And Ardern said a review of the way the Reserve Bank operates would take into account factors such as employment levels and price stability. Currently the bank primarily considers inflation when setting interest rates.  Ardern also outlined a plan to spend 1 billion New Zealand dollars ($693 million) a year on the country’s smaller towns and regions to improve rail and other infrastructure.  “You’d be hard-pressed to find a region that hasn’t experienced neglect,” she said.  Ardern said she spoke to President Donald Trump for about five minutes on Monday after he called to congratulate her on her election win. She said Trump told her the election had received quite a bit of coverage in Washington and throughout the East Coast, and that she talked to him about New Zealand’s important role in the Asia-Pacific region.  “Our relationship with the U.S. is incredibly important,” Ardern said when asked about Trump. “That has not changed and it will not change.”",5.0,1,[5.0]

The British Ministry Of Defense said in a statement Monday Oct. 23, 2017, that it will give Canada the shipwrecks and artifacts of British explorer John Franklin, who tried to chart the Northwest Passage through the Canadian Arctic in 1845, all hands perished in the attempt. (AP Photo, FILE)  LONDON (AP) — Britain announced Monday it will give Canada the shipwrecks of British explorer John Franklin, who perished with his crew while trying to chart the Northwest Passage through the Arctic in the 1840s.  The HMS Erebus and the HMS Terror were found in 2014 and 2016 about 30 miles (48 kilometers) apart near King William Island in the Canadian Arctic, some 1,200 miles (2,000 kilometers) northwest of Toronto.  Under an agreement between the two countries, the wrecks were the property of Britain although Canada had custody and control of them. The U.K. Ministry of Defense said Monday it would transfer ownership to Parks Canada, but retain a small sample of artifacts.  British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon said the arrangement “will ensure that these wrecks and artifacts are conserved for future generations.”  Franklin and 128 hand-picked men set out in 1845 to find the passage — a shortcut to Asia that supposedly ran from the Atlantic to the Pacific by way of the Arctic. All of them died, making the voyage the worst tragedy in the history of Arctic exploration.  Historians believe the ships got trapped in thick ice in 1846, and Franklin and some other crew members died in the ensuing months. The survivors apparently abandoned the two ships in April 1848 in a hopeless bid to reach safety overland. Inuit lore tells of “white men who were starving” in the area as late as the winter of 1850.  Dozens of searches by the British and Americans in the 1800s failed to locate the wrecks, and some of those expeditions ended in tragedy, too. The ships were among the most sought-after prizes in marine archaeology.  Canada announced in 2008 that it would look for the ships and poured millions of dollars into the ultimately successful search.  The Terror was discovered in 24 meters (26 yards) of water in Terror Bay, west of the community of Gjoa Haven, right where an Inuit hunter said it was.  Canada’s government said Monday it recognizes the invaluable contributions of Inuit in helping find the wrecks. Environment Minister Catherine McKenna said the ships would be co-owned with the local indigenous. There are no plans to raise the ships.  “We will continue to work with our Inuit partners on the protection and presentation of the two wreck sites and artifacts for generations to come,” McKenna said in a statement.  ___  Associated Press writer Rob Gillies in Toronto contributed to this report.",4.0,2,"[4.0, 4.0]"

However, confusion still remains about the new regulations, which come at the end of a 120-day period following the United States lifting a ban on laptops in airplane cabins affecting 10 Mideast cities. The new regulations cover all the 2,100 flights from around the world entering the U.S. on any given day.  Some airlines said they had received permission to delay implementing the new rules until January.  At Dubai International Airport, the world’s busiest for international travel, long-haul carrier Emirates began questioning passengers about their luggage, liquids they were carrying and where they were coming from. Passengers also had to have their carry-on bags searched, along with their electronics.  Emirates declined to discuss the new procedures in detail on Thursday. On Wednesday, it said it would conduct “passenger pre-screening interviews” for those traveling on U.S.-bound flights in concert with other checks on electronics.  Elsewhere, things did not appear to be going so smoothly. In China, an official in the Xiamen Airlines press office, who would only give his surname as Qiu, said that the airlines received a “demand” about the new U.S. regulations and planned “to take some security measures, including security safety interviews from today on.”  “We’re not going to interview all passengers, but focus on those with a certain degree of risk when checking the passengers’ documents on the ground,” he said, without elaborating.  An official with the Eastern Airlines publicity department said that she saw media reports about security safety interviews but didn’t have immediate details on what her company was doing. An official at the Beijing Airport press center would only say: “We always strictly follow relevant regulations of the Civil Aviation Administration when conducting security checks.” Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity under regulations.  At Air China, the country’s flag carrier, an official who only gave his surname, Zhang, said it would comply.  “We will meet the demands from the U.S. side, but as for the detailed measures (we will take), it is inconvenient for us to release,” he said.  South Korea’s Transport Ministry said that the United States agreed to delay implementing the new screening for the country’s two biggest carriers, Korean Air Lines Co. and Asiana Airlines Inc., until next year on condition they deploy staff at boarding gates to monitor travelers.  Royal Jordanian, based in Amman, also has said it would introduce the new procedures in mid-January.  Other airlines with U.S.-bound flights at Seoul’s Incheon International Airport brought in as many as seven extra staff Thursday to question passengers under the new rules but there were no major delays, airport spokesman Lee Jung-hoon said.  Singapore Airlines passengers may be required to “undergo enhanced security measures” including inspection of personal electronic devices “as well as security questioning during check-in and boarding,” the carrier said on its website.  Other carriers who announced the new regulations on Wednesday included Air France, Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., the airlines of Germany’s Lufthansa Group and EgyptAir.  In Hong Kong, passengers described some of the questions they were asked.  “They asked me if I packed my own bag, where I packed it from, where I came from, they looked at my itinerary, verify where I was, who I was, from where I came from,” said Fran Young, who was travelling to Los Angeles.  Some showed displeasure.  “It’s a little inconvenient, I kind of just want to get my printed ticket and then just go inside,” passenger Gavin Lai said. “I don’t want to wait on people to interview me like that. So it’s a little annoying.”  U.S. carriers also will be affected by the new rules. Delta Air Lines said it was telling passengers traveling to the U.S. to arrive at the airport at least three hours before their flight and allow extra time to get through security. United declined to comment, while American did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  In March, U.S. officials introduced the laptop ban in the cabins of some Mideast airlines over concerns Islamic State fighters and other extremists could hide bombs inside of them. The ban was lifted after those airlines began using devices like CT scanners to examine electronics before passengers boarded planes heading to the U.S. Some also increasingly swab passengers’ hands to check for explosive residue.  The laptop ban as well as travel bans affecting predominantly Muslim countries have hurt Mideast airlines. Emirates, the region’s biggest, said it slashed 20 percent of its flights to the U.S. in the wake of the restrictions.  ___  Associated Press writers Yu Bing in Beijing, Kelvin Chan and Josie Wong in Hong Kong, Anna Johnson in Phoenix and Youkyung Lee in Seoul contributed to this report.  ___  Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellap .

1026,2590,10,26,2017,2017-10-26,Associated Press News,"House backs $4T budget, faces challenges on Trump tax plan"," Republicans powered a $4 trillion budget through the House on Thursday by a razor-thin margin, a close vote underscoring the difficulties that lie ahead in delivering President Donald Trump’s promise to cut taxes.  For now, Republicans sidestepped divisions within the party by voting 216-212 to permit them to begin work on a $1.5 trillion tax cut without fear of blocking tactics by Democrats. The legislative landscape is strewn with land mines, however, as GOP tax-writers pick winners and losers among interest groups, business sectors and rank-and-file voters.  The tax bill is the top item on the GOP agenda and would be Trump’s first big win in Congress. Republicans hope it would provide a much-needed jolt for the party’s political fortunes in advance of next year’s midterm elections. Republicans view passage of the upcoming tax measure as a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and its importance has only grown since the party’s debacle on health care.  The goal is a full rewrite of the inefficient, loophole-laden tax code in hopes of lower rates for corporations and other businesses and a burst of economic growth. But evidence is growing that some of their hoped-for bold steps — such as eliminating the deduction for state and local taxes — will be replaced by half-measures dictated by politics and a narrow margin for error.  GOP leaders scrambled in recent days to overcome resistance from House conservatives unhappy about deficits and debt, as well as opposition by lawmakers from high-tax states upset about plans to eliminate the state and local tax deduction. That could mean higher taxes for many middle-class earners, and top Republicans like Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin promise a compromise that won’t be as costly to middle-class taxpayers.  Joining all Democrats in opposing the measure were 20 Republicans, a mix of spending hawks and centrists. More than half come from New York and New Jersey and vehemently reject any effort to roll back the state and local tax deduction.  “This isn’t over,” said Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., who opposed the budget after voting for it earlier this month. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said concerns by lawmakers such as MacArthur about the deduction would be addressed in coming days, and it was the topic of a post-vote meeting that included top GOP leaders.  “We stood firm ... to let them know we’re not kidding,” said Rep. John Katko, R-N.Y., as he exited the session.  The Senate passed the budget measure last week and the House endorsed it without changes, a step designed to allow Republicans to move quickly to the tax measure in hopes of passing it into law this year. House and Senate leaders want to pass companion measures before Thanksgiving with a final compromise coming before year’s end.  Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, said immediately after the vote that he’ll release the tax measure on Nov. 1 and that a panel vote is expected the week of Nov. 6.  That timetable is ambitious as numerous details, including ways to raise revenues to help finance cuts to individual and corporate tax rates, remain unresolved. The tax plan’s popularity is not a given with voters, however, and fissures among Republicans could to slow the measure.  A battle over tax-free contributions to retirement accounts has also broken open, and Republican tax-writers have yet to lock down dozens of crucial details on tax rates and preferences. Republicans may also drop efforts to fully repeal taxes on multimillion-dollar estates, even though the idea is a longstanding feature of the party’s tax agenda.  “I’m confident that there will be a tax bill. I’m confident that it will be an improvement over current policy. How good it is yet to be determined,” said former Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, a veteran of Reagan-era tax battles and an architect of a 2001 tax cut. “You always dream of wiping things off the books and making dramatic changes, but it’s very hard to do.”  The underlying budget measure abandons the Republican Party’s promise to rein in deficits in favor of Trump’s boast of “massive tax cuts.” The measure drops proposed cuts to mandatory programs such as food stamps, though conservatives promise to take on spending cuts later.  “I still feel strongly about addressing unsustainable mandatory spending,” said Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn., who chairs the House Budget Committee. “I think we will tackle this important issue in the future. We don’t have a choice.”  Democrats united against the plan, arguing its tax cuts will pad the bank accounts of the wealthy and the balance sheets of corporations, while delivering modest relief — or none at all — to middle-income taxpayers.  “These tax cuts will not create an economic boom, but will instead lead to a higher concentration of wealth among the rich, while dramatically increasing deficits and debt,” said Rep. John Yarmuth, D-Ky.  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., urged Democrats immediately after the vote to “be fully mobilized to expose the ruinous consequences of Republicans’ plans to raise taxes on the middle class, especially as Republicans try to race their bill through the House before the American people can see the damage it will cause in their lives.”  The budget plan calls for $5 trillion in spending cuts over the decade, including cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and the Obama-era health care law, though Republicans have no plans to actually impose those cuts with follow-up legislation. Some Democrats criticized the measure for ruthless spending cuts; others took the opposite approach, failing it for tackling the deficit.",3.3378378378378377,37,"[4.5, 3.0, 0.5, 5.0, 1.0, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 2.5, 3.5, 3.0, 5.0, 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 0.5, 5.0, 4.0, 2.5, 3.0, 5.0, 2.0, 0.5, 3.5, 2.5, 4.0, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 3.0, 3.0, 3.5, 3.5]"

(AP Photo/Vincent Yu)  HONG KONG (AP) — World stock markets rose Thursday after the European Central Bank was cautious in its move to dial back on its bond-buying stimulus program.  KEEPING SCORE: France’s CAC 40 rose 1 percent to 5,426 and Germany’s DAX gained 0.6 percent to 13,036. Britain’s FTSE 100 added 0.6 percent to 7,488. Wall Street was poised to open higher. Dow futures were up 0.2 percent while those for the S&P 500 gained 0.1 percent.  ECB: The ECB said it would reduce its bond purchases to 30 billion euros ($35 billion) per month starting in January, from 60 billion euros currently. The purchases would continue at least until September 2018. The bank kept some flexibility in its statement, saying that it could increase the purchases if the 19-country eurozone endures a new economic shock. Investors are watching the news conference of ECB President Mario Draghi for more details on the bank’s stimulus outlook.  PROFIT AND LOSS: Investors were digesting the latest round of quarterly corporate earnings reports. In South Korea, automaker Hyundai Motors reported its net income plunged by a fifth in the July-September period, adding to a nearly four-year long losing streak, while LG Electronics reported a wider loss for its mobile division even as its overall business stayed profitable. Germany’s Deutsche Bank reported that net income more than doubled on cost cuts and Finnish network operator Nokia posted a wider net loss. They follow shaky earnings reports from U.S. companies including telecom giant AT&T, aerospace company Boeing and chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices.  FED SHORTLIST: Anticipation is building for President Donald Trump’s decision on who should lead the Federal Reserve once Chair Janet Yellen’s term expires in February. His choice is expected before he leaves for an Asia trip on Nov. 3. In a TV interview, he praised Yellen but also acknowledged his conflicting desire to make his own mark. Among the four other candidates, Trump’s top economic adviser Gary Cohn is now seen as out of the running.

1035,2609,10,25,2017,2017-10-25,Associated Press News,Scientists working toward reversible kind of gene editing," Scientists are altering a powerful gene-editing technology in hopes of one day fighting diseases without making permanent changes to people’s DNA.  The trick: Edit RNA instead, the messenger that carries a gene’s instructions.  “If you edit RNA, you can have a reversible therapy,” important in case of side effects, said Feng Zhang of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, a gene-editing pioneer whose team reported the new twist Wednesday in the journal Science.  A genome editing technique called CRISPR has revolutionized scientific research. It’s a biological cut-and-paste tool that lets researchers spot a gene defect inside living cells and use molecular “scissors” to snip that spot, either deleting, repairing or replacing the affected gene.  Researchers are using CRISPR to try to improve crops, develop malaria-resistant mosquitoes, grow transplantable organs inside animals, and develop treatments that one day may help genetic diseases such as sickle cell or muscular dystrophy.  There are challenges for medical use. Because a change to DNA is permanent, accidentally cutting the wrong spot could lead to lasting side effects.  And DNA repair is harder to achieve in certain cells, such as brain and muscle cells, than in others, such as blood cells — so targeting RNA may offer an important alternative, said University of California, San Diego, professor Gene Yeo, who wasn’t involved in Wednesday’s study. His team is creating its own RNA-targeting version of CRISPR.  Disease can occur when a genetic defect leaves cells making too little or too much of a particular protein, or not making it at all.  RNA, a cousin of DNA, carries the gene’s instructions to start the protein-making process. Editing RNA’s instructions should result in temporary fixes to abnormal protein production, Zhang explained. Because RNA degrades over time, the changes theoretically would last only as long as the therapy was used.  To starting figuring out how, researchers returned to nature.  This is how instructions from DNA are copied into RNA, the messenger that carries a gene’s instructions.  CRISPR was adapted for use in mammalian cells from a system that evolved in bacteria, and uses as its molecular scissors an enzyme named Cas9. Zhang’s team examined relatives in the Cas protein family and found one, Cas13, that could target RNA instead. The researchers engineered a Cas13 variety so it sticks to RNA instead of cutting it. They then fused on another protein to edit that spot and tested it in lab dishes.  The research is in its earliest stages, requiring more work before it even could be tested in animals.  But San Diego’s Yeo, who is using a different Cas approach to target RNA, praised the competing work.  “It really tells us that many Cas proteins can truly bind RNA,” he said. “The smart thing to do is to test a lot of them.”  ___  This Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

The material’s dangers have long been recognized. But a 1989 attempt to ban most asbestos products was overturned by a federal court, and it remains in widespread use. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya)  BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — Spurred by the chemical industry, President Donald Trump’s administration is retreating from a congressionally mandated review of some of the most dangerous chemicals in public use: millions of tons of asbestos, flame retardants and other toxins in homes, offices and industrial plants across the United States.  Instead of following President Barack Obama’s proposal to look at chemicals already in widespread use that result in some of the most common exposures, the new administration wants to limit the review to products still being manufactured and entering the marketplace.  For asbestos, that means gauging the risks from just a few hundred tons of the material imported annually — while excluding almost all of the estimated 8.9 million tons (8.1 million metric tons) of asbestos-containing products that the U.S. Geological Survey said entered the marketplace between 1970 and 2016.  The review was intended to be the first step toward enacting new regulations to protect the public. But critics - including health workers, consumer advocates, members of Congress and environmental groups - contend ignoring products already in use undermines that goal.  The administration’s stance is the latest example of Trump siding with industry. In this case, firefighters and construction workers say the move jeopardizes their health.  The Trump administration is retreating from a review of some of the most dangerous chemicals, including millions of tons of asbestos. The review would be limited to chemicals entering the marketplace, and not toxins already in public use. (Oct. 25)  Both groups risk harm from asbestos because of its historical popularity in construction materials ranging from roofing and flooring tiles to insulation used in tens of millions of homes. Most of the insulation came from a mine in a Montana town that’s been declared a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Superfund site and where hundreds of people have died from asbestos exposure.  “Hundreds of thousands of firefighters are going to be affected by this. It is by far the biggest hazard we have out there,” said Patrick Morrison, assistant general president for health and safety at the International Association of Fire Fighters. “My God, these are not just firefighters at risk. There are people that live in these structures and don’t know the danger of asbestos.”  The EPA told The Associated Press on Wednesday that there were measures to protect the public other than the law Congress passed last year, which mandated the review of asbestos and nine other chemicals to find better ways to manage their dangers. For example, workers handling asbestos and emergency responders can use respirators to limit exposure, the agency said in a statement.  Asbestos fibers can become deadly when disturbed in a fire or during remodeling, lodging in the lungs and causing problems including mesothelioma, a form of cancer. The material’s dangers have long been recognized. But a 1989 attempt to ban most asbestos products was overturned by a federal court, and it remains in widespread use.  The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health analyzed cancer-related deaths among 30,000 firefighters from Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco. The 2015 study concluded firefighters contract mesothelioma at twice the rate of other U.S. residents.  Firefighters also face exposure to flame retardants included in the EPA’s review that are used in furniture and other products.  “I believe the chemical industry is killing firefighters,” said Tony Stefani, a former San Francisco fireman who retired in 2003 after 28 years when diagnosed with cancer he believes resulted from exposure to chemicals in the review.  Stefani said he was one of five in his station to contract cancer in a short period. Three later died, while Stefani had a kidney removed and endured a year of treatment before being declared cancer-free.  “When I entered the department in the early 70s, our biggest fear was dying in the line of duty or succumbing to a heart attack,” he said. “Those were the biggest killers, not cancer. But we work in a hazardous-materials situation every time we have a fire now.”  Mesothelioma caused or contributed to more than 45,000 deaths nationwide between 1999 and 2015, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study in March. The number of people dying annually from the disease increased about 5 percent during that time.  In one of its last acts under Obama, the EPA said in January it would judge the chemicals “in a comprehensive way” based on their “known, intended and reasonably foreseen uses.”  Under Trump, the agency has aligned with the chemical industry, which sought to narrow the review’s scope. The EPA now says it will focus only on toxins still being manufactured and entering commerce. It won’t consider whether new handling and disposal rules are needed for “legacy,” or previously existing, materials.  “EPA considers that such purposes generally fall outside of the circumstances Congress intended EPA to consider,” said EPA spokeswoman Enesta Jones, adding the agency lacks authority to regulate noncommercial uses of the chemicals.  One of the law’s co-authors, New Mexico Democratic Sen. Tom Udall, disputes that Congress wanted to limit the review.  “It doesn’t matter whether the dangerous substance is no longer being manufactured; if people are still being exposed, then there is still a risk,” Udall told AP. “Ignoring these circumstances would openly violate the letter and the underlying purpose of the law.”  Democrats and public health advocates have criticized EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt for installing people with longstanding ties to the chemical industry into senior positions at the agency. On Wednesday, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, on a party-line vote, advanced the nomination of Michael Dourson, a toxicologist whose work has been paid for by the industry, to oversee the EPA’s chemical safety program.  Two prior appointments worked for the American Chemistry Council, the industry’s lobbying arm: Nancy Beck, deputy assistant administrator for chemical safety Nancy Beck and Liz Bowman, the associate administrator for public affairs.  The council pushed back against the Obama administration’s interpretation of the law, urging the EPA’s new leadership to narrow its review. The Trump administration did that in June.  “Did we get everything we wanted? No. But we certainly agree the (Trump) administration put forth a reasonable final rule,” said council vice president Michael Walls. Broadening the review, he added, would send the EPA “down a rabbit hole chasing after illusory risks.”  The politically influential National Association of Homebuilders, which represents the residential construction industry, fears broadly interpreting the new law would lead to burdensome regulations that are unnecessary because it says asbestos disposal rules already are adequate.  Many of those regulations are based on a 1994 Occupational Safety and Health Administration finding that materials had to contain at least 1 percent asbestos to qualify for regulation. But public health experts say the 1 percent threshold is arbitrary.  “It’s bad medicine, and it’s harmful,” said Michael Harbut, an internal medicine professor at Detroit’s Wayne State University and medical adviser to an insulation workers’ union.  “There’s still a lot of asbestos out there,” said Harbut, who helped establish criteria used by physicians to diagnose and treat asbestos-related diseases. “It’s still legal, it’s still deadly, and it’s going to be a problem for decades to come.”  ___  Follow Matthew Brown on Twitter at www.twitter.com/matthewbrownap",3.8333333333333335,3,"[2.0, 5.0, 4.5]"

Researchers at the University of Colorado have found more evidence that an increase in earthquakes on the Colorado-New Mexico border since 2001 was caused by wells that inject wastewater from oil and gas production back underground. Quakes in Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas have also been linked to the practice. (AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez, File)  DENVER (AP) — Scientists say they have more evidence that an increase in earthquakes on the Colorado-New Mexico border since 2001 has been caused by wells that inject wastewater from oil and gas production back underground, similar to human-caused quakes in Oklahoma and other states.  A paper published last week by researchers at the University of Colorado concluded that the wastewater caused a big enough increase in underground pressure to make rock formations slip along fault lines.  “You find that the pressure changes at a given depth are enough to trigger earthquakes,” said Jenny Nakai, the paper’s lead author and a doctoral student at the university.  The paper, published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth, is the latest to link wastewater injection wells to earthquakes.  Most oil and gas wells produce at least some wastewater that is too salty to use, so regulators allow energy companies to pump it back underground to get rid of it. Researchers have linked earthquakes in Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas to wastewater injection.  Oklahoma had only a few dozen earthquakes of magnitude-3.0 or greater in 2012 but had more than 900 in 2015. The number dropped to closer to 600 last year after state regulators directed energy companies to close some injection wells or reduce the volume of water they inject.  In the Raton Basin of northern New Mexico and southern Colorado, earthquakes began to increase in 2001, about two years after large-scale wastewater injection began, the U.S. Geological Survey said. The wastewater comes from wells that extract natural gas from underground coal beds.  The biggest quake in the basin since 2001 was magnitude-5.3 in 2011. It caused minor damage to buildings in Trinidad, Colorado, about 15 miles from the epicenter.  A 2014 paper by the Geological Survey blamed injection wells for the area’s quakes. The new University of Colorado study went further, using computer models and records of wastewater injection to conclude that enough pressure built up to cause the quakes.  Justin Rubinstein, a geophysicist with the Geological Survey who was the lead author of the 2014 paper, said the computer models have been used in other locations but not in the Raton Basin before now.  Rubinstein was not involved in the University of Colorado study and said he was not familiar with all its details but that the general conclusions made sense.  “It’s consistent with what my research has shown,” he said.  The University of Colorado study also found that the Raton Basin earthquakes were more widespread than previously thought, said Nakai, the lead author.  Earlier studies focused on the Colorado portion of the basin because that was the site of a 2001 swarm of 12 quakes — the strongest was magnitude-4.6 — as well as the 5.3 quake in 2011.  But seismometers recorded 1,881 quakes in the area between 2008 and 2010, and 1,442 of them were in New Mexico, Nakai said. The strongest was magnitude-3.8.  The 2008-2010 data came from a temporary deployment of seismometers as part of two other research projects funded by the National Science Foundation, Nakai said.  ___  Follow Dan Elliott at http://twitter.com/DanElliottAP .

Kennedy, bending to CIA and FBI appeals, while the National Archives came out Thursday night with a hefty cache of others.  “I have no choice,” Trump said in a memo, citing “potentially irreversible harm” to national security if he were to allow all records to come out now. He placed those files under a six-month review while letting 2,800 others come out, racing a deadline to honor a law mandating their release.  The documents approved for release capture the frantic days after the Nov. 22, 1963, assassination, during which federal agents madly chased after tips, however thin, juggled rumors and sifted through leads worldwide.  They include cables, notes and reports stamped “Secret” that reveal the suspicions of the era — around Cubans and Communists. They cast a wide net over varied activities of the Kennedy administration, such as its covert efforts to upend Fidel Castro’s government in Cuba.  For historians, it’s a chance to answer lingering questions, put some unfounded conspiracy theories to rest, perhaps give life to other theories.  Prof. Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia said it was ""ridiculous"" that so much time has passed since the assassination of President John F. Kennedy without the public release of documents. (Oct. 24)  Despite having months to prepare for disclosures that have been set on the calendar for 25 years, Trump’s decision came down to a last-minute debate with intelligence agencies — a tussle the president then prolonged by calling for still more review.  The delay sparked a round of finger-pointing among agencies and complaints that Trump should have released all records.  Roger Stone, a sometime Trump adviser who wrote a book about his theories on the assassination, urged Trump to review personally any material that government agencies still want to withhold. Trump should at least “spot check” any extensive redactions to make sure agencies are not “dabbling in acts of criminal insubordination,” Stone said in a statement.  As for the unreleased documents, Trump will impress upon federal agencies that “only in the rarest cases” should JFK files stay secret after the six-month review, officials said.  In the meantime, experts will be poring through a mountain of minutiae and countless loose threads in search of significant revelations.  In the chaotic aftermath of the assassination, followed two days later by the murder of the shooter, Lee Harvey Oswald while in police custody, FBI Director J, Edgar Hoover vented his frustration in a formerly secret report found in the files. It opened: “There is nothing further on the Oswald case except that he is dead.”  But, reflecting on Oswald less than an hour after he died, Hoover already sensed theories would form about a conspiracy broader than the lone assassin.  “The thing I am concerned about, and so is (deputy attorney general) Mr. Katzenbach, is having something issued so we can convince the public that Oswald is the real assassin,” he said.  He also reported: “Last night we received a call from our Dallas office from a man talking in a calm voice and saying he was a member of a committee organized to kill Oswald.”  Hoover said he relayed that warning to Dallas police and was assured Oswald would be sufficiently protected. Oswald was shot dead the next day by Jack Ruby.  The following message will be displayed to users with unsupported browsers: Your browser does not support the iframe HTML tag.

A document from 1975 contains a partial deposition by Richard Helms, a deputy CIA director under Kennedy who later became CIA chief, to the Rockefeller Commission, which was studying unauthorized CIA activities in domestic affairs. Commission lawyers appeared to be probing for information on what foreign leaders might have been the subject of assassination attempts by or on behalf of the CIA.  A lawyer asks Helms: “Is there any information involved with the assassination of President Kennedy which in any way shows that Lee Harvey Oswald was in some way a CIA agent or agent” — here the document ends, short of his answer.  Among the files is a more than 400-page document that appeared to describe people being monitored as potential threats to Kennedy and his successor, Lyndon B. Johnson.  Officials described one such person this way: “Subject participated in pickets against JFK in 1961. Allegedly trained in guerrilla tactics & sabotage. Considered very dangerous by those who know him. Has visited USA & Cuba. Considered armed and dangerous.”  Some suspicions missed the mark badly.  One document describes a person who sent a letter to Johnson in December 1963 stating “you’re doomed.” The document says: “Interviewed 1/23/64; friendly. Said letter was a joke. Not dangerous. Attending 5th grade.”  The collection also discloses a Sept. 14, 1962, meeting of a group of Kennedy’s senior aides, including brother Robert, the attorney general, as they discussed a range of options against Castro’s communist government.  The meeting was told the CIA would look into the possibility of sabotaging airplane parts that were to be shipped to Cuba from Canada. McGeorge Bundy, JFK’s national security adviser, cautioned that sensitive ideas like sabotage would have to be considered in more detail on a case-by-case basis.  Much of Thursday passed with nothing from the White House or National Archives except silence, leaving unclear how the government would comply with a law requiring the records to come out by the end of the day — unless Trump was persuaded by intelligence agencies to hold some back.  White House officials said the FBI and CIA made the most requests within the government to withhold some information.  Trump ordered agencies that have proposed withholding material related to the assassination to report to the archivist by next March 12 on which specific information meets the standard for continued secrecy.  That standard includes details that could cause “harm to the military defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement or conduct of foreign relations,” Trump wrote in his order. The archivist will have two weeks to tell Trump whether those recommendations validate keeping the withheld information a secret after April 26.  The full record will still be kept from the public for at least six months — and longer if agencies make a persuasive enough case for continued secrecy.  The collection includes more than 3,100 records — comprising hundreds of thousands of pages — that have never been seen by the public. About 30,000 documents were released previously — with redactions.  Whatever details are released, they’re not expected to give a definitive answer to a question that still lingers for some: Whether anyone other than Oswald was involved in the assassination.  The Warren Commission in 1964 concluded that Oswald had been the lone gunman, and another congressional probe in 1979 found no evidence to support the theory that the CIA had been involved. But other interpretations, some more creative than others, have persisted.  ___  Associated Press writers Alanna Durkin Richer in Boston and Laurie Kellman in Washington contributed to this report.",3.1666666666666665,3,"[5.0, 1.0, 3.5]"

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)  WASHINGTON (AP) — There was no dam break of Republican rancor against Donald Trump, a day after a pair of the party’s prominent senators denounced their president and invited colleagues to join them. Instead, most GOP lawmakers rallied around Trump and his agenda Wednesday, with one all but saying “good riddance” to Jeff Flake of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee.  “Maybe we do better by having some of the people who just don’t like him leave, and replace them with somebody else,” Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma told The Associated Press. “And I think that’s what’s happening.”  Trump heartily agreed, declaring that both men were retiring because they couldn’t win re-election, and “I think I’m probably helped greatly in Arizona by what happened with Sen. Flake.”  Inhofe went further than most GOP lawmakers, but he had plenty of company in his refusal to echo the criticisms of Flake and Corker. Trump himself proclaimed he was leading a party unified in its pursuit of tax cut legislation.  “There is great unity in the Republican Party,” he contended as he left the White House for a hurricane briefing and other events in Texas. Claiming a show of affection at his appearance at a Senate GOP lunch a day earlier, Trump said: “I called it a lovefest. It was almost a lovefest. Maybe it was a lovefest.” He’s said repeatedly that he got multiple standing ovations.  President Donald Trump has described as ""sad,"" reporting that says Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and the DNC helped pay for political research over his ties to Russia. Trump also insists there is ""great unity,"" within the GOP. (Oct. 25)  But if the lunch — no outsiders allowed — displayed unity of sorts, the events that preceded and followed it did the opposite. First Corker and then Flake blistered Trump with criticism, accusing him of leading the nation into a moral black hole. Both lawmakers do plan to retire at the end of next year, a semi-bombshell Flake dropped Tuesday, freeing them to speak without fear.  Flake kept it up Wednesday with an opinion piece in The Washington Post. He likened the current moment to the red scare era of the early 1950s when Sen. Joseph McCarthy threw accusations of communism at a wide range of people. McCarthy’s career ended in disgrace, his downfall hastened when an Army lawyer, Joseph Welch, confronted him at a hearing with the question: “Have you no sense of decency, Sir, at long last?”  “We face just such a time now. We have again forgotten who we are supposed to be,” Flake wrote. “There is a sickness in our system — and it is contagious.”  “Nine months of this administration is enough for us to stop pretending that this is somehow normal, and that we are on the verge of some sort of pivot to governing, to stability. Nine months is more than enough for us to say, loudly and clearly: Enough.”  Flake has contended in interviews that the Republican Party is at a tipping point, or close to one, and others will start to speak out, too.  There was scant evidence of that Wednesday on Capitol Hill, aside from the few Republicans in the House and Senate who have already made public their grievances with Trump. Nearly everyone else dodged questions on the topic, voiced unqualified support for Trump, or answered by saying that distractions aside, the GOP must remain focused on passing landmark legislation to simplify and reduce taxes.  After a drought of legislative accomplishments so far this year, a tax bill would give Republicans a major victory and a powerful argument for retaining their majorities in next year’s midterm elections, something the lawmakers desperately want.  “You know my answer. I’m focused on getting stuff done,” said Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, when asked about his colleagues’ criticisms of Trump. “He was elected. I disagree with him fairly frequently, and I do so publicly and privately. But I want to work with him to get stuff done.”  Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina refused to discuss Trump’s standing.  “I am just not going to engage in that conversation at all. There’s no benefit to anyone,” Scott said. “At the end of the day the goal is for us to keep the focus on the American people and tax reform that will help them keep more of their money.”  Sen. David Perdue of Georgia was even more direct. “We’re all professionals here. These two guys can say and do what they want to do. But right now, we’ve got a bigger issue, and the bigger issue is to get this tax bill done,” he said.  In addition to their desire to get results on taxes, many GOP lawmakers confront the political reality that despite Trump’s relatively low poll numbers nationally, he retains the loyalty of a segment of the party’s base that nearly any Republican needs to win re-election. Trump has shown he can turn viciously on critics, and few want to find themselves in his Twitter crosshairs.  Flake and Corker raised the question: Will the GOP ever part ways with its mercurial leader? Certainly not today.  ___  Associated Press writers Catherine Lucey, Richard Lardner, Eileen Putman and Andrew Taylor contributed.",3.272727272727273,11,"[5.0, 2.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.5, 0.5, 4.0, 2.5, 1.0, 3.5, 4.0]"

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)  WASHINGTON (AP) — In ringing and personal terms, President Donald Trump on Thursday pledged that “we will overcome addiction in America,” declaring opioid abuse a national public health emergency and announcing new steps to combat what he described as the worst drug crisis in U.S. history.  Trump’s declaration, which will be effective for 90 days and can be renewed, will allow the government to redirect resources in various ways and to expand access to medical services in rural areas. But it won’t bring new dollars to fight a scourge that kills nearly 100 people a day.  “As Americans we cannot allow this to continue,” Trump said in a speech at the White House, where he bemoaned an epidemic he said had spared no segment of society, affecting rural areas and cities, rich and poor and both the elderly and newborns.  “It is time to liberate our communities from this scourge of drug addiction,” he said. “We can be the generation that ends the opioid epidemic.”  Deaths have surged from opioids, which include some prescribed painkillers, heroin and synthetic drugs such as fentanyl, often sold on the nation’s streets.  Administration officials said they also would urge Congress, during end-of-the year budget negotiations, to add new cash to a public health emergency fund that Congress hasn’t replenished for years and contains just $57,000.  President Donald Trump on Thursday declared the opioid crisis a nationwide public health emergency - a step that won't bring new dollars to fight a scourge that kills nearly 100 Americans a day. (Oct. 26)  But critics said Thursday’s words weren’t enough.  “How can you say it’s an emergency if we’re not going to put a new nickel in it?” said Dr. Joseph Parks, medical director of the nonprofit National Council for Behavioral Health, which advocates for addiction treatment providers. “As far as moving the money around,” he added, “that’s like robbing Peter to pay Paul.”  Democratic House leader Nancy Pelosi said, “Show me the money.”  Trump’s audience Thursday included parents who have lost children to drug overdoses, people who have struggled with addiction, first responders and lawmakers.  Trump also spoke personally about his own family’s experience with addiction: His older brother, Fred Jr., died after struggling with alcoholism. It’s the reason the president does not drink.  Trump described his brother as a “great guy, best looking guy,” with a personality “much better than mine.”  “But he had a problem, he had a problem with alcohol,” the president said. “I learned because of Fred.”  Trump said he hoped a massive advertising campaign, which sounded reminiscent of the 1980s “Just Say No” campaign, might have a similar impact.  “If we can teach young people, and people generally, not to start, it’s really, really easy not to take ’em,” he said.  It’s a path taken by previous presidents, including Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, all of whom tried to rally the nation to confront drug abuse but fell short of solving the problem. Some people have become hooked on opioids after being prescribed prescription pain killers by doctors after injuries or surgery.  As a presidential candidate, Trump had pledged to make fighting addiction a priority. Once in office, Trump assembled a commission, led by Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, to study the problem. The commission’s interim report argued an emergency declaration would free additional money and resources, but some in Trump’s administration disagreed.

Try viewing this in a modern browser like Chrome, Safari, Firefox or Internet Explorer 9 or later.  “What the president did today was historic and it is an extraordinary beginning set of steps to dealing with this problem,” Christie told reporters at the White House after the speech.  Some also faulted the White House for not issuing a wider emergency declaration to deal with the crisis.  Rob Brandt, an Ohio man who lost his 20-year-old son to a heroin overdose in 2011, called Trump’s public health emergency order a “good incremental step” but urged greater focus on prevention and long-term treatment.  “The federal government has lagged behind in truly decisive action,” said Brandt, who opened an opioid recovery center in Medina, Ohio this year, run on private donations and grants.  “We lost 64,000 Americans last year,” he said, “and if you look at, if we were to have a foreign country attack us and kill 60,000 Americans or a terrorist attack that killed 60,000 Americans, we would print money to combat that.”  As a result of Trump’s declaration, officials will be able to expand access to telemedicine services, including substance abuse treatment for people living in rural and remote areas. Officials will also be able to more easily deploy state and federal workers, secure Department of Labor grants for the unemployed, and shift funding for HIV and AIDs programs to provide more substance abuse treatment for people already eligible for those programs.  Trump said his administration would also be working to reduce regulatory barriers, such as one that bars Medicaid from paying for addiction treatment in residential rehab facilities larger than 16 beds. He spoke of ongoing efforts to require opioid prescribers to undergo special training, the Justice Department’s targeting of opioid dealers and efforts to develop a non-addictive painkiller.  Trump said one specific prescription opioid, which he described as “truly evil,” would be withdrawn immediately from the market. White House spokesman Hogan Gildey later said he was referring to the painkiller Opana ER. That drug was pulled from the market in July at the Food and Drug Administration’s request following a 2015 outbreak of HIV and hepatitis C in southern Indiana linked to sharing needles to inject the pills.  Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said Trump’s effort falls far short of what is needed and will divert staff and resources from other vital public health initiatives.  “Families in Connecticut suffering from the opioid epidemic deserve better than half measures and empty rhetoric offered seemingly as an afterthought,” he said in a statement. He argued, “An emergency of this magnitude must be met with sustained, robust funding and comprehensive treatment programs.”  Democrats also criticized Trump’s efforts to repeal and replace the “Obamacare” health law. Its Medicaid expansion has been crucial in confronting the opioid epidemic.  Adopted by 31 states, the Medicaid expansion provides coverage to low-income adults previously not eligible. Many are in their 20s and 30s, a demographic hit hard by the epidemic. Medicaid pays for detox and long-term treatment.  Trump, meanwhile, tempered expectations even as he projected hope.  “Our current addiction crisis, and especially the epidemic of opioid deaths, will get worse before it gets better. But get better it will,” he said. “It will take many years and even decades to address this scourge in our society, but we must start in earnest now to combat national health emergency.  “Working together,” he said, “we will defeat this opioid epidemic. ... We will free our nation from the terrible affliction of drug abuse. And, yes, we will overcome addiction in America.”  ___  AP Medical Writer Carla K. Johnson reported from Chicago.

1073,2651,10,26,2017,2017-10-26,Associated Press News,"House backs $4T budget, faces challenges on Trump tax plan"," Republicans powered a $4 trillion budget through the House on Thursday by a razor-thin margin, a close vote underscoring the difficulties that lie ahead in delivering President Donald Trump’s promise to cut taxes.  For now, Republicans sidestepped divisions within the party by voting 216-212 to permit them to begin work on a $1.5 trillion tax cut without fear of blocking tactics by Democrats. The legislative landscape is strewn with land mines, however, as GOP tax-writers pick winners and losers among interest groups, business sectors and rank-and-file voters.  The tax bill is the top item on the GOP agenda and would be Trump’s first big win in Congress. Republicans hope it would provide a much-needed jolt for the party’s political fortunes in advance of next year’s midterm elections. Republicans view passage of the upcoming tax measure as a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and its importance has only grown since the party’s debacle on health care.  The goal is a full rewrite of the inefficient, loophole-laden tax code in hopes of lower rates for corporations and other businesses and a burst of economic growth. But evidence is growing that some of their hoped-for bold steps — such as eliminating the deduction for state and local taxes — will be replaced by half-measures dictated by politics and a narrow margin for error.  GOP leaders scrambled in recent days to overcome resistance from House conservatives unhappy about deficits and debt, as well as opposition by lawmakers from high-tax states upset about plans to eliminate the state and local tax deduction. That could mean higher taxes for many middle-class earners, and top Republicans like Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin promise a compromise that won’t be as costly to middle-class taxpayers.  Joining all Democrats in opposing the measure were 20 Republicans, a mix of spending hawks and centrists. More than half come from New York and New Jersey and vehemently reject any effort to roll back the state and local tax deduction.  “This isn’t over,” said Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., who opposed the budget after voting for it earlier this month. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said concerns by lawmakers such as MacArthur about the deduction would be addressed in coming days, and it was the topic of a post-vote meeting that included top GOP leaders.  “We stood firm ... to let them know we’re not kidding,” said Rep. John Katko, R-N.Y., as he exited the session.  The Senate passed the budget measure last week and the House endorsed it without changes, a step designed to allow Republicans to move quickly to the tax measure in hopes of passing it into law this year. House and Senate leaders want to pass companion measures before Thanksgiving with a final compromise coming before year’s end.  Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, said immediately after the vote that he’ll release the tax measure on Nov. 1 and that a panel vote is expected the week of Nov. 6.  That timetable is ambitious as numerous details, including ways to raise revenues to help finance cuts to individual and corporate tax rates, remain unresolved. The tax plan’s popularity is not a given with voters, however, and fissures among Republicans could to slow the measure.  A battle over tax-free contributions to retirement accounts has also broken open, and Republican tax-writers have yet to lock down dozens of crucial details on tax rates and preferences. Republicans may also drop efforts to fully repeal taxes on multimillion-dollar estates, even though the idea is a longstanding feature of the party’s tax agenda.  “I’m confident that there will be a tax bill. I’m confident that it will be an improvement over current policy. How good it is yet to be determined,” said former Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, a veteran of Reagan-era tax battles and an architect of a 2001 tax cut. “You always dream of wiping things off the books and making dramatic changes, but it’s very hard to do.”  The underlying budget measure abandons the Republican Party’s promise to rein in deficits in favor of Trump’s boast of “massive tax cuts.” The measure drops proposed cuts to mandatory programs such as food stamps, though conservatives promise to take on spending cuts later.  “I still feel strongly about addressing unsustainable mandatory spending,” said Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn., who chairs the House Budget Committee. “I think we will tackle this important issue in the future. We don’t have a choice.”  Democrats united against the plan, arguing its tax cuts will pad the bank accounts of the wealthy and the balance sheets of corporations, while delivering modest relief — or none at all — to middle-income taxpayers.  “These tax cuts will not create an economic boom, but will instead lead to a higher concentration of wealth among the rich, while dramatically increasing deficits and debt,” said Rep. John Yarmuth, D-Ky.  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., urged Democrats immediately after the vote to “be fully mobilized to expose the ruinous consequences of Republicans’ plans to raise taxes on the middle class, especially as Republicans try to race their bill through the House before the American people can see the damage it will cause in their lives.”  The budget plan calls for $5 trillion in spending cuts over the decade, including cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and the Obama-era health care law, though Republicans have no plans to actually impose those cuts with follow-up legislation. Some Democrats criticized the measure for ruthless spending cuts; others took the opposite approach, failing it for tackling the deficit.",3.505714285714286,175,"[0.5, 3.5, 1.5, 2.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 3.5, 0.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.5, 2.5, 2.5, 4.5, 2.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 1.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 1.0, 1.0, 3.5, 0.5, 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 4.5, 4.5, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0, 1.5, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 2.0, 4.0, 2.5, 0.5, 2.5, 4.0, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 2.0, 4.0, 0.5, 3.5, 1.5, 5.0, 4.0, 2.5, 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 4.5, 1.0, 4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 5.0, 3.0, 2.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.5, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5, 2.5, 3.0, 0.5, 2.5, 4.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 3.5, 2.5, 4.5, 5.0, 5.0, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 3.5, 0.5, 4.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 3.0, 3.0, 4.0, 2.5, 4.5, 2.5, 4.5, 4.5, 1.0, 3.5, 5.0, 4.0, 1.5, 0.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 1.5, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 2.5, 5.0, 3.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 2.5, 2.5, 4.5, 1.5, 2.5, 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0]"
1074,2652,10,26,2017,2017-10-26,Associated Press News,New screenings begin for passengers on US-bound flights," In this Wednesday, March 22, 2017 file photo, an Emirates plane taxis to a gate at Dubai International Airport at Dubai International Airport in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Long-haul carrier Emirates says it is starting new screening procedures for U.S.-bound passengers following it receiving ""new security guidelines"" from American authorities. (AP Photo/Adam Schreck, File)  DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — New security screenings for all passengers on U.S.-bound flights began on Thursday, with airlines worldwide questioning flyers about their trip and their luggage in the latest Trump administration decision affecting global travel.  However, confusion still remains about the new regulations, which come at the end of a 120-day period following the United States lifting a ban on laptops in airplane cabins affecting 10 Mideast cities. The new regulations cover all the 2,100 flights from around the world entering the U.S. on any given day.  Some airlines said they had received permission to delay implementing the new rules until January.  At Dubai International Airport, the world’s busiest for international travel, long-haul carrier Emirates began questioning passengers about their luggage, liquids they were carrying and where they were coming from. Passengers also had to have their carry-on bags searched, along with their electronics.  Emirates declined to discuss the new procedures in detail on Thursday. On Wednesday, it said it would conduct “passenger pre-screening interviews” for those traveling on U.S.-bound flights in concert with other checks on electronics.  Elsewhere, things did not appear to be going so smoothly. In China, an official in the Xiamen Airlines press office, who would only give his surname as Qiu, said that the airlines received a “demand” about the new U.S. regulations and planned “to take some security measures, including security safety interviews from today on.”  “We’re not going to interview all passengers, but focus on those with a certain degree of risk when checking the passengers’ documents on the ground,” he said, without elaborating.  An official with the Eastern Airlines publicity department said that she saw media reports about security safety interviews but didn’t have immediate details on what her company was doing. An official at the Beijing Airport press center would only say: “We always strictly follow relevant regulations of the Civil Aviation Administration when conducting security checks.” Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity under regulations.  At Air China, the country’s flag carrier, an official who only gave his surname, Zhang, said it would comply.  “We will meet the demands from the U.S. side, but as for the detailed measures (we will take), it is inconvenient for us to release,” he said.  South Korea’s Transport Ministry said that the United States agreed to delay implementing the new screening for the country’s two biggest carriers, Korean Air Lines Co. and Asiana Airlines Inc., until next year on condition they deploy staff at boarding gates to monitor travelers.  Royal Jordanian, based in Amman, also has said it would introduce the new procedures in mid-January.  Other airlines with U.S.-bound flights at Seoul’s Incheon International Airport brought in as many as seven extra staff Thursday to question passengers under the new rules but there were no major delays, airport spokesman Lee Jung-hoon said.  Singapore Airlines passengers may be required to “undergo enhanced security measures” including inspection of personal electronic devices “as well as security questioning during check-in and boarding,” the carrier said on its website.  Other carriers who announced the new regulations on Wednesday included Air France, Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., the airlines of Germany’s Lufthansa Group and EgyptAir.  In Hong Kong, passengers described some of the questions they were asked.  “They asked me if I packed my own bag, where I packed it from, where I came from, they looked at my itinerary, verify where I was, who I was, from where I came from,” said Fran Young, who was travelling to Los Angeles.  Some showed displeasure.  “It’s a little inconvenient, I kind of just want to get my printed ticket and then just go inside,” passenger Gavin Lai said. “I don’t want to wait on people to interview me like that. So it’s a little annoying.”  U.S. carriers also will be affected by the new rules. Delta Air Lines said it was telling passengers traveling to the U.S. to arrive at the airport at least three hours before their flight and allow extra time to get through security. United declined to comment, while American did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  In March, U.S. officials introduced the laptop ban in the cabins of some Mideast airlines over concerns Islamic State fighters and other extremists could hide bombs inside of them.

1075,2653,10,26,2017,2017-10-26,Associated Press News,Companies are looking for diverse ad teams to avoid blunders," CoverGirl executive Ukonwa Ojo was struck when the team from an ad agency entered the room to pitch ideas for revamping the cosmetic company’s image. For the first time in Ojo’s more than 20-year career in business, she found herself working with an African-American creative director.  That meeting would ultimately result in a marketing campaign that challenges conventional ideas about beauty. It features celebrity women from a spectrum of races, ages and professions, including Issa Rae of HBO’s “Insecure,” motorcycle racer Shelina Moreda, celebrity chef Ayesha Curry and dietitian Maye Musk, 69.  “To have an African-American creative director walk in the room and present this to me, I thought, ‘Oh, my God, this is amazing,’” said Ojo, who is Nigerian-American. “I think we can see the power of the work because of that.”  Diversity in the advertising industry is becoming a higher priority for consumer product companies as they try to reach a new generation of customers with evolving sensibilities on ethnicity, age, gender and sexuality.  Many companies have come to believe that having people with a variety of backgrounds in the room can not only produce a smarter marketing campaign but also help avoid the kind of blunders Kellogg and Dove were recently accused of in today’s politically combustible environment.  Despite efforts by Madison Avenue to ramp up recruiting of minorities, just 7 percent of the 67,000 people working as advertising and promotion managers in the U.S. in 2016 were African-American, less than 5 percent were Hispanic, and about 1 percent were of Asian descent, according to the U.S. Labor Department. Women accounted for about 56 percent of managers in the industry.  In the case of CoverGirl’s makeover, which replaced the company’s familiar “Easy, Breezy, Beautiful” tagline with “I Am What I Makeup,” the team from the ad agency Droga5 had two black creative directors, Shannon Washington and Ray Smiling.  “The team that worked on this idea and this campaign came from very different backgrounds — from a male and female point of view, different races, different ages,” Droga5 CEO Sarah Thompson said. “I think that more than before, what’s important is getting that narrative, that story, right and really pressure-testing. Is it authentic? Is there anything that is going to be misinterpreted?”  On Wednesday, Kellogg apologized after the artwork on its Corn Pops cereal boxes was attacked as racist. The box shows cartoon Corn Pops hanging out in a mall. The only brown one depicted is a janitor scrubbing the floor.  Dove was similarly criticized earlier this month over a commercial for a body wash. A short version of the video on Facebook showed a black woman taking off her shirt to reveal a white woman, who then removed her top to reveal a woman with a brown complexion. Social media users accused Dove of suggesting black skin is dirty.  Dove pulled the video, while Kellogg said new artwork for the cereal box will soon reach stores. Neither Unilever, the company that owns Dove, nor Kellogg has said who was behind the content.  Other brands, including Pepsi, Gap and Nivea, have faced similar controversies.  Ojo, who before joining CoverGirl was senior global director at Unilever, said her former company “always had the best intentions,” but “as humans we always have the opportunities to make a mistake.” She added: “It can minimize the chances if you have the right people around the table.”  Having more diversity around the table is seen as a safeguard at a time when companies are under pressure to produce lots of video and other marketing content quickly and cheaply for Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, often with no time to test everything out on focus groups.  “In the good old days, you would have the time to take your TV ad or print campaign and do further testing. You would see how they are rating A and B ad,” said Gene Fischer, senior vice president of media innovation at Publicis Health Media. “The world of social media doesn’t allow for that.”  Aside from trying to diversify their own ranks, some marketers are turning for help to small agencies that cater to specific ethnic groups. Being Latino, a social media marketing company, has crafted ads for Bud Light, Snickers and Coca-Cola.  “My entire company, every employee comes from the culture that we are trying to appeal to,” said Being Latino founder Lance Rios. “We know the do’s and the don’ts.”  Tiffany R. Warren, chief diversity officer at Omnicom, the parent of the some of the nation’s biggest advertising agencies, got her start in 1997 through an industry program to recruit top minority students out of college. Since then, however, she has often been the only black woman in the room.  “I know my presence in the room had led to a lot of meaningful conversations and led to creative products that were more culturally sensitive,” said Warren, who is also founder of the nonprofit group ADCOLOR, which promotes diversity in the creative fields.",3.2629310344827585,116,"[5.0, 0.5, 4.0, 5.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 0.5, 4.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.0, 0.5, 0.5, 5.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 5.0, 3.0, 2.5, 2.0, 3.5, 0.5, 3.5, 4.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 2.0, 0.5, 5.0, 2.5, 1.0, 4.5, 3.0, 4.5, 4.0, 5.0, 3.5, 2.5, 1.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 2.5, 2.5, 0.5, 3.5, 1.5, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 1.5, 0.5, 3.5, 2.5, 4.0, 5.0, 2.5, 1.0, 4.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 4.5, 3.0, 2.5, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 0.5, 5.0, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 0.5, 2.5, 3.0, 5.0, 3.0, 2.5, 2.5, 4.5, 2.0, 4.0, 4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.5, 3.0, 1.5, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5, 3.0, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5]"

Superstorm Sandy roared ashore five years ago, Monday, Oct. 29, 2012, devastating the coastlines of New Jersey, New York and parts of Connecticut and becoming one of the costliest storms in U.S. history. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig)  Five years after Superstorm Sandy was supposed to have taught the U.S. a lesson about the dangers of living along the coast, disaster planning experts say there is no place in America truly prepared for climate change and the tempests it could bring.  That is true even in New York and New Jersey, where cities and towns got slammed by deadly floodwaters that rose out of the Atlantic on the evening of Oct. 29, 2012.  While billions have been spent to repair the damage, protecting vulnerable infrastructure, people and property across the nation from the more extreme weather that climate change could bring is going to require investment on a staggering scale, easily costing hundreds of billions, perhaps trillions.  Some coastal protection projects are moving forward, but the most ambitious ideas spurred by Sandy’s onslaught are still in the design stage, with questions about whether they will ever be built.  Some wonder whether the nation has the will to undertake such ventures, even after this past season brought more catastrophic storms, including Hurricane Harvey, which swamped Houston, and Hurricane Maria, which laid waste to Puerto Rico’s electrical grid.  It's been five years since Superstorm Sandy inflicted billions of dollars in damage in New York and New Jersey, but many wonder if the region is any more prepared for extreme weather now than it was before Sandy. (Oct. 27)  “It felt after Sandy as if we might have finally had our wake-up call. We’d start to take these things seriously,” said Eric Klinenberg, director of the Institute for Public Knowledge, a think tank at New York University. “We’d make the kind of investment in climate security that we made in homeland security after Sept. 11. But of course nothing of the sort has happened.”  Some experts worry also that the ascendance of a climate-change skeptic to the White House may put the brakes on coastal protection efforts. In August, President Donald Trump rescinded President Barack Obama’s post-Sandy order requiring future sea level rise to be factored into federally funded infrastructure projects.  “Since the new administration is not using the CC word, the climate change word, it’s very hard to instill this forward-looking kind of attitude where you have to take into account sea level rise and how the flood zones expand,” says Klaus Jacob, a Columbia University scientist specializing in climate change adaptation.  And yet, some planners still hope that Sandy created momentum for projects that could serve as national models.  ___  BIG IDEAS  After Sandy, which was blamed for at least 182 deaths in the U.S. and Caribbean and more than $71 billion in damage in this country alone, a government-funded competition called Rebuild by Design produced audacious ideas for defending the coast.  One concept, dubbed The Big U, would create 10 miles (16 kilometers) of floodwalls, berms and gates around lower Manhattan. Other ideas include erecting breakwaters around Staten Island that would double as oyster beds, and reconfiguring the Meadowlands, the polluted wetlands of urban New Jersey, with berms and marshes.  The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development put up $1 billion to get those projects started, but construction hasn’t begun on any of them.  Amy Chester, Rebuild By Design’s executive director, said it will take years to complete all the planning and gain government approvals and community support. And it’s not clear how much these projects will ultimately cost.  ___  ONE CITY’S PLAN  LaTrenda Ross gets teary-eyed recalling the days after Sandy flooded the streets of Hoboken, New Jersey, a city of 50,000 people across the Hudson River from Manhattan that has been her home for 40 years.  “To not be able to go to work, to sit there in the dark, no elevators, no way out, was devastating,” she said. If something isn’t done to prevent a repeat, “there won’t even be a city of Hoboken. We might as well pack up and move now.”  New Jersey does, in fact, have a plan. Over the summer it hired an engineering firm to carry out one of the Rebuild by Design concepts: an anti-flood system for Hoboken. The $230 million project, funded by HUD, involves a series of floodwalls, pumping stations and water retention tanks.  Construction is due to start in 2019 and take at least three years.  Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer said the cost is worth it. Eighty percent of the city flooded during Sandy, she said, causing as much as $1 billion in damage. Buildings were ruined. Three of the city’s four fire stations flooded. A vital commuter train station was knocked out for months.  Laura Baird, an engineer who helped develop the plan, said had the system been in place when Sandy hit, 85 percent of the city would have been protected.  ___  PROGRESS AND DOUBT  While the grandest ideas about post-Sandy protections are still far from reality, there has been progress .  Communities on the New Jersey shore built sand dunes to hold back surf, or fortified existing ones. Power companies and New York’s subway system have put flood protections around key infrastructure. Hospitals moved electrical equipment out of basements.  The Army Corps of Engineers is scheduled to begin construction in 2019 on a 5-mile-long (8-kilometer-long), 20-foot-high (6-meter-high) seawall and promenade that would run along New York’s Staten Island in front of the neighborhoods hit hardest by Sandy. The project, which is still being designed, has an estimated price tag of $600 million and is scheduled for completion by 2022.  Michael Cappannari, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said the administration is committed to helping communities recognize the risk and defend against flooding. He cited several federally funded projects underway, including construction of boardwalks with seawalls hidden beneath them and flood-proofing of sewage treatment systems.  It’s not enough, said Jacob, the Columbia scientist.  “It’s on a pace that’s dictated by the funds that are available, politically made available,” he said. “And if that snail’s pace continues, there’s a good chance that we may have another severe storm in town or in the region that will outpace that slow pace of improving the systems.”  Politicians locally and in Congress appear reluctant to get behind enormously expensive and sometimes divisive projects to deal with a threat that often feels hypothetical.  In Hoboken, for example, one proposal for a floodwall that would have protected more of the city was rejected because it would have blocked river views. Cities throughout the country have been reluctant to curtail building on the waterfront, because those spots are in such great demand from homebuyers.  In New York City, FEMA redrew the flood maps after Sandy, nearly doubling to 71,500 the number of buildings deemed to be in high-risk zones. The city objected for fear that would raise flood insurance rates and stifle waterfront development, and last year FEMA agreed to roll the flood zones back.  Bill Golden, president of the National Institute for Coastal and Harbor Infrastructure, said worrying about spending too much is shortsighted, and he blames the inaction on “a misunderstanding of the new reality that we face.”  A study released Monday by an international team of scientists predicted that between 2030 and 2045, New York City could experience storm surges of over 7.4 feet (2.25 meters) every five years, primarily because of sea level rise. That’s up from every 25 years in recent decades.  ___  NO RETREAT  After Sandy, New York and New Jersey bought and emptied 1,250 homes in areas it deemed too difficult to protect from floods.  Patty Snyder, whose 53-year-old brother drowned when Sandy struck, was among the Staten Islanders who took a buyout. “I knew I was never going back, because I felt the city, state and federal governments never were going to do what needed to be done to stop future flooding,” she said.  But most people in the wrecked communities did return, whether because they were skeptical of the risk, confident about the planned Staten Island seawall, or simply unwilling to say goodbye to their homes.  Some homes were rebuilt on elevated foundations or pilings. Others were restored to the way they were before Sandy, leaving them just as vulnerable.  “I really don’t think it will happen again,” said Fred Steinfeld, a Staten Island resident whose basement filled with water during Sandy. “I just think that storms like that don’t happen that often.”  Dexter Dugan, whose Staten Island home got 9 feet of water, took steps to make it more storm-resistant, including putting heating and electrical systems on the second floor.  “You live near the water, it’s going to flood,” he said.  ___  For complete coverage of the five-year anniversary of Superstorm Sandy, go to https://www.apnews.com/tag/SuperstormSandy  ___  This story has been corrected to show that the damage is more than $71 billion, not $65 billion.",2.9310344827586206,29,"[4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 2.5, 2.5, 4.5, 4.0, 2.0, 5.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.5, 1.5, 2.5, 4.5, 2.5, 4.0, 2.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.5, 4.5, 0.5, 4.0, 5.0, 1.5, 5.0, 3.5, 2.5]"

A large population of already vulnerable monarch butterflies are stuck in Canada and in the Northeast. They are late on their migration south _ they should be in Texas at this time _ because unusually warm weather delayed their flight and now winds and other factors aren't making it easy or maybe even possible to go south before the coming frost. (Darlene Burgess via AP)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Monarch butterflies, those delicate symbols of spring and summer, should mostly be in Texas by now, winging their way to Mexico for the winter.  But Darlene Burgess keeps seeing colorful clusters of them — and she lives in Canada.  “As nice as this is to see, I really wish I wouldn’t see it because they’re running out of time,” said Burgess, who does evening monarch counts at Point Pelee National Park in Canada. “It’s really not good for them.”  It’s not just Canada. Swarms have been seen elsewhere, including near Cape May , New Jersey, at levels more normal for late September and early October.  Scientists say tens of thousands of the butterflies are likely to be stranded far north of where they’d normally be this time of year because of the unusually warm weather and strong winds that have kept them from migrating south, said biologist Elizabeth Howard, director of the monarch tracking non-profit Journey North .  Many of these butterflies might not even be alive if not for the warm weather. They are thought to be a sort of bonus generation — they were able to develop and emerge late in the season because it’s been so unusually warm.  Monarchs typically arrive in Mexico around Nov. 1. This many “stragglers” in Ontario and elsewhere is “definitely new territory for us,” said University of Kansas biology professor Chip Taylor, director of Monarch Watch.  Some monarchs were born late, some didn’t move south because temperatures were warm, and some couldn’t move south because winds were coming from the south for weeks and they couldn’t fly through them.  Now they may be stuck because temperatures are starting to fall. Howard said their muscles don’t work when temperatures dip into the 50s. And if they don’t freeze, they are likely to starve to death because much of the plants they need to feed their long voyage south are already gone for the season, biologists said.  “What’s really important is they’ve got to get out of town,” Howard said.  Burgess counted hundreds of them Sunday, watched several of them fight the strong wind on Tuesday and fall into the waves of Lake Erie. She saw at least 50 on Thursday.  “It’s very strange,” said Sweet Briar College biology professor Lincoln Brower, who has been studying monarchs since 1954.  Monarchs stuck up north are one of many signs of climate change toying with the natural world’s timing, such as delaying first fall freezes and bringing spring earlier, said Jake Weltzin, a U.S. Geological Survey ecologist who heads a national network which studies when plants and animals bloom, change colors, migrate and hibernate.  Karen Oberhauser, a biologist at the University of Wisconsin, saw a monarch on Oct. 20 in Madison, and sees some hope — for the butterflies if not for the planet. If not for the heat, some of these butterflies would have died as caterpillars, she noted, and some will beat the odds and make it to Mexico.  “It’s not an ominous sign for monarchs, but it is ominous,” Oberhauser said.  Monarchs have had some very lean years lately, and there is a petition to make them a threatened species. They are battling a dwindling food supply, especially milkweeds which are the only thing they eat when in the caterpillar stage, habitat loss, climate change and pesticides, Brower said.  Hopes that this would be a big bounce-back year have now dwindled. Taylor wouldn’t say it’s a good year, but it’s not as bad as some others, especially a horrible 2013-2014 season.  “Not all is lost,” Taylor said.  ___  Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears .

The pope asked the crew — three Americans, two Russians and an Italian — what gives them the most joy in their work.  Bresnik, a U.S. Marine who flew combat missions during the Iraq war, said what strikes him is that in space there are “no borders, there is no conflict, it’s just peaceful.”  The astronaut said: “People cannot come up here and see the indescribable beauty of our Earth and not be touched in their souls.”  He added: “You see the thinness of the atmosphere, it makes you realize how fragile our existence here is.”  ___  4 p.m.  Pope Francis has praised Russia’s “humanistic and religious” understanding of the power of love, during a phone call with Russian, American and Italian crew members of the International Space Station.

Russian cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin replied by noting that he had been reading St. Exupery’s “The Little Prince” while in space and was taken by the child’s understanding of love.  He told Francis “Love is the force that gives you strength to give your life for someone else.”  Francis praised his response, saying “It’s clear you have understood the message that St. Exupery so poetically explained, and that you Russians have in your blood, in your humanistic and religious tradition.”  ___  2 p.m.  The cold-call pope is setting his sights set heavenward by ringing astronauts aboard the International Space Station.

Mattis is accusing North Korea of building a nuclear arsenal to ""threaten others with catastrophe,"" and says the Trump administration remains committed to compelling the North to accept complete nuclear disarmament. Mattis pledged solidarity with the South in remarks Friday while inside the Demilitarized Zone that separates the two Koreas. (Jeon Heon-kyun/Pool Photo via AP)  PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) — On his first visit to the tense but eerily quiet frontier between North and South Korea as U.S. secretary of defense, Jim Mattis conveyed the message he hopes will win the day: Diplomacy is the answer to ending the nuclear crisis with the North, not war.  He made the point over and over - at the Panmunjom “truce village” where North literally meets South; at a military observation post inside the Demilitarized Zone, and in off-the cuff comments to U.S. and South Korean troops.  “We’re doing everything we can to solve this diplomatically - everything we can,” he told the troops after alighting from a Black Hawk helicopter that had ferried him to and from the border some 25 miles north of central Seoul.  “Ultimately, our diplomats have to be backed up by strong soldiers and sailors, airmen and Marines,” he added, “so they speak from a position of strength, of combined strength, of alliance strength, shoulder to shoulder.”  At Panmunjom, where the armistice ending the Korean war was signed in July 1953, Mattis quoted Secretary of State Rex Tillerson as saying, “Our goal is not war.” The aim, he said, is to compel the North to completely and irreversibly eliminate a nuclear weapons program that has accelerated since President Donald Trump took office.  US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis visited the Demilitarized Zone marking the border between North and South Korea. He said the administration's goal is not war, but the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. (Oct. 27)  Despite unanimous condemnation by the U.N. Security Council of the North’s missile launches and nuclear tests, “provocations continue,” Mattis said.  As Mattis arrived at Panmunjom alongside South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo, a small group of apparent tourists watched from the balcony of a building on North Korea’s side of the line that marks the inter-Korean border. Uniformed North Korean guards watched silently as Mattis and Song stood just yards away.  Atop Observation Post Ouellette, where he could see deep into North Korea and hear their broadcast taunts of the South, Mattis listened to Song recount some of the history of the 1950-53 Korean war in which thousands of Americans and perhaps more than a million Koreans died in a conflict that remains officially unsettled.  “It reminds us that we fought together in very difficult times, and we stick together today,” Mattis said inside a Demilitarized Zone of craggy terrain, millions of landmines and ghost-like reminders of the war.  The U.S. has about 28,500 troops based in South Korea and has maintained a military presence there since the Korean War ended.  Mattis’s counterpart, Song, gave the former four-star Marine general the lay of the land, noting that the North has 342 long-range artillery pieces aimed at Seoul, among other weapons. That’s a threat that cannot be defended against, Song said, so Washington and Seoul must come up with “new offensive concepts” to be able to eliminate the artillery before it can be used, should war break out.  Mattis called the North “an oppressive regime that shackles its people, denying their freedom, their welfare and their human dignity in pursuit of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery in order to threaten others with catastrophe.”  He noted that earlier this week in the Philippines, he and Song joined Southeast Asian defense ministers in committing to a diplomatic solution to the North Korea problem, even though Pyongyang and its young leader, Kim Jong Un, show no interest in negotiations.  Two other developments Thursday showed the U.S. intention to continue building diplomatic and economic pressure on Pyongyang. The Trump administration imposed sanctions on 10 North Korean officials and organizations over human rights abuses and censorship, including a diplomat in China accused of forcing North Korean asylum seekers home.  Meanwhile, a rare military exercise involving three of the U.S. Navy’s aircraft carrier strike groups was being planned for next month in the Asia Pacific, a U.S. official said. The likely exercise would happen around the time that Trump travels to the region, including to Seoul.  The three Navy carriers and the ships that accompany them are currently thousands of miles apart in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific. But they are moving through the region and could be closer together in weeks.  Trump entered office declaring his commitment to solving the North Korea problem, asserting that he would succeed where his predecessors had failed. His administration has sought to increase pressure on Pyongyang through U.N.

How that plays out should be known on Oct. 26, 2017, when long-secret files are expected to be released. (Warren Commission via AP)  WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has blocked the release of hundreds of records on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, bending to CIA and FBI appeals, while the National Archives came out Thursday night with a hefty cache of others.  “I have no choice,” Trump said in a memo, citing “potentially irreversible harm” to national security if he were to allow all records to come out now. He placed those files under a six-month review while letting 2,800 others come out, racing a deadline to honor a law mandating their release.  The documents approved for release and made public late Thursday capture the frantic days after the Nov. 22, 1963, assassination, during which federal agents madly chased after tips, however thin, juggled rumors and sifted through leads worldwide.  They include cables, notes and reports stamped “Secret” that reveal the suspicions of the era — around Cubans and Communists. They cast a wide net over varied activities of the Kennedy administration, such as its covert efforts to upend Fidel Castro’s government in Cuba.  For historians, it’s a chance to answer lingering questions, put some unfounded conspiracy theories to rest, perhaps give life to other theories.  President Trump blocked the release of hundreds of records on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, bending to CIA and FBI appeals, while the National Archives came out Thursday night with a hefty cache of others. (Oct. 26)  Despite having months to prepare for disclosures that have been set on the calendar for 25 years, Trump’s decision came down to a last-minute debate with intelligence agencies — a tussle the president then prolonged by calling for still more review.  The delay sparked a round of finger-pointing among agencies and complaints that Trump should have released all records.  Roger Stone, a sometime Trump adviser who wrote a book about his theories on the assassination, urged Trump to review personally any material that government agencies still want to withhold. Trump should at least “spot check” any extensive redactions to make sure agencies are not “dabbling in acts of criminal insubordination,” Stone said in a statement.  As for the unreleased documents, Trump will impress upon federal agencies that “only in the rarest cases” should JFK files stay secret after the six-month review, officials said.  In the meantime, experts will be poring through a mountain of minutiae and countless loose threads in search of significant revelations.  In the chaotic aftermath of the assassination, followed two days later by the murder of the shooter, Lee Harvey Oswald while in police custody, FBI Director J, Edgar Hoover vented his frustration in a formerly secret report found in the files. It opened: “There is nothing further on the Oswald case except that he is dead.”  But, reflecting on Oswald less than an hour after he died, Hoover already sensed theories would form about a conspiracy broader than the lone assassin.  “The thing I am concerned about, and so is (deputy attorney general) Mr. Katzenbach, is having something issued so we can convince the public that Oswald is the real assassin,” he said.  He also reported: “Last night we received a call from our Dallas office from a man talking in a calm voice and saying he was a member of a committee organized to kill Oswald.”  Hoover said he relayed that warning to Dallas police and was assured Oswald would be sufficiently protected. Oswald was shot dead the next day by Jack Ruby.  A document from 1975 contains a partial deposition by Richard Helms, a deputy CIA director under Kennedy who later became CIA chief, to the Rockefeller Commission, which was studying unauthorized CIA activities in domestic affairs. Commission lawyers appeared to be probing for information on what foreign leaders might have been the subject of assassination attempts by or on behalf of the CIA.  A lawyer asks Helms: “Is there any information involved with the assassination of President Kennedy which in any way shows that Lee Harvey Oswald was in some way a CIA agent or agent” — here the document ends, short of his answer.  Among the files is a more than 400-page document that appeared to describe people being monitored as potential threats to Kennedy and his successor, Lyndon B. Johnson.  Officials described one such person this way: “Subject participated in pickets against JFK in 1961. Allegedly trained in guerrilla tactics & sabotage. Considered very dangerous by those who know him. Has visited USA & Cuba. Considered armed and dangerous.”  Some suspicions missed the mark badly.  One document describes a person who sent a letter to Johnson in December 1963 stating “you’re doomed.” The document says: “Interviewed 1/23/64; friendly. Said letter was a joke. Not dangerous. Attending 5th grade.”  The collection also discloses a Sept. 14, 1962, meeting of a group of Kennedy’s senior aides, including brother Robert, the attorney general, as they discussed a range of options against Castro’s communist government.  The meeting was told the CIA would look into the possibility of sabotaging airplane parts that were to be shipped to Cuba from Canada. McGeorge Bundy, JFK’s national security adviser, cautioned that sensitive ideas like sabotage would have to be considered in more detail on a case-by-case basis.  Much of Thursday passed with nothing from the White House or National Archives except silence, leaving unclear how the government would comply with a law requiring the records to come out by the end of the day — unless Trump was persuaded by intelligence agencies to hold some back.

White House officials said the FBI and CIA made the most requests within the government to withhold some information.  Trump ordered agencies that have proposed withholding material related to the assassination to report to the archivist by next March 12 on which specific information meets the standard for continued secrecy.  That standard includes details that could cause “harm to the military defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement or conduct of foreign relations,” Trump wrote in his order. The archivist will have two weeks to tell Trump whether those recommendations validate keeping the withheld information a secret after April 26.  The full record will still be kept from the public for at least six months — and longer if agencies make a persuasive enough case for continued secrecy.  The collection includes more than 3,100 records — comprising hundreds of thousands of pages — that have never been seen by the public. About 30,000 documents were released previously — with redactions.  Whatever details are released, they’re not expected to give a definitive answer to a question that still lingers for some: Whether anyone other than Oswald was involved in the assassination.  The Warren Commission in 1964 concluded that Oswald had been the lone gunman, and another congressional probe in 1979 found no evidence to support the theory that the CIA had been involved. But other interpretations, some more creative than others, have persisted.  ___  https://interactives.ap.org/jfk-documents/  ___  Associated Press writers Alanna Durkin Richer in Boston and Laurie Kellman in Washington contributed to this report.",3.1666666666666665,15,"[4.0, 2.5, 3.0, 5.0, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 2.0, 0.5, 4.0, 3.5, 2.5, 2.0, 4.0, 3.5]"

A computer server crucial to a lawsuit against Georgia election officials was quietly wiped clean in July 2017, just after the suit was filed. Data on the server could have indicated whether Georgia elections were manipulated by malicious hackers. (AP Photo/Alex Sanz, File)  A computer server crucial to a lawsuit against Georgia election officials was quietly wiped clean by its custodians just after the suit was filed, The Associated Press has learned.  The server’s data was destroyed July 7 by technicians at the Center for Elections Systems at Kennesaw State University, which runs the state’s election system. The data wipe was revealed in an email sent last week from an assistant state attorney general to plaintiffs in the case that was later obtained by the AP. More emails obtained in a public records request confirmed the wipe.  The lawsuit, filed July 3 by a diverse group of election reform advocates, aims to force Georgia to retire its antiquated and heavily criticized election technology. The server in question, which served as a statewide staging location for key election-related data, made national headlines in June after a security expert disclosed a gaping security hole that wasn’t fixed six months after he reported it to election authorities.  WIPED OUT  It’s not clear who ordered the server’s data irretrievably erased.  The Kennesaw elections center answers to Georgia’s secretary of state, Brian Kemp, a Republican running for governor in 2018 and the suit’s main defendant. His spokeswoman issued a statement Thursday saying his office had neither involvement nor advanced warning of the decision. It blamed “the undeniable ineptitude” at the Kennesaw State elections center.  After declining comment for more than 24 hours, Kennesaw State’s media office issued a statement late Thursday attributing the server wiping to “standard operating procedure.” It did not respond to the AP’s question on who ordered the action.  Plaintiffs in the lawsuit, mostly Georgia voters, want to scrap the state’s 15-year-old vote-management system — particularly its 27,000 AccuVote touchscreen voting machines, hackable devices that don’t use paper ballots or keep hardcopy proof of voter intent. The plaintiffs were counting on an independent security review of the Kennesaw server, which held elections staging data for counties, to demonstrate the system’s unreliability.  Wiping the server “forestalls any forensic investigation at all,” said Richard DeMillo, a Georgia Tech computer scientist following the case. “People who have nothing to hide don’t behave this way.”  STATE SECURITY  The server data could have revealed whether Georgia’s most recent elections were compromised by hackers. The plaintiffs contend results of both last November’s election and a special June 20 congressional runoff— won by Kemp’s predecessor, Karen Handel — cannot be trusted.  Possible Russian interference in U.S. politics, including attempts to penetrate voting systems, has been an acute national preoccupation since the Obama administration sounded the alarm more than a year ago.  Kemp and his GOP allies insist Georgia’s elections system is secure. But Marilyn Marks, executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, a plaintiff, believes server data was erased precisely because the system isn’t secure.  “I don’t think you could find a voting systems expert who would think the deletion of the server data was anything less than insidious and highly suspicious,” she said.  NOW YOU SEE IT, NOW YOU DON’T  It could still be possible to recover relevant information from the server.  The FBI is known to have made an exact data image of the server in March when it investigated the security hole. The Oct. 18 email disclosing the server wipe said the state attorney general’s office was “reaching out to the FBI to determine whether they still have the image” and also disclosed that two backup servers were wiped clean Aug. 9, just as the lawsuit moved to federal court.  On Wednesday, the attorney general’s office notified the court of its intent to subpoena the FBI seeking the image.  Atlanta FBI spokesman Stephen Emmett would not say if that image still exists. Nor would he say whether agents examined it to determine whether the server’s files might have been altered by unauthorized users.  FAILING TO SERVICE THE SERVER  A 180-page collection of Kennesaw State emails, obtained Friday by the Coalition for Good Governments via an open records search, details the destruction of the data on all three servers and a partial and ultimately ineffective effort by Kennesaw State systems engineers to fix the main server’s security hole.  As a result of the failed effort, sensitive data on Georgia’s 6.7 million voters — including Social Security numbers, party affiliation and birthdates — as well as passwords used by county officials to access elections management files remained exposed for months.  The problem was first discovered by Atlanta security researcher Logan Lamb while doing online research in August 2016. He informed the election center’s director at the time, noting in an email “there is a strong possibility your site is already compromised.”  Based on his review of the emails, Lamb believes that electronic polling books could have been altered in Georgia’s biggest counties to add or drop voters or to scramble their data. Malicious hackers could have altered the templates of voting machine memory cards to skew results. An attacker could even have potentially modified “ballot-building” files to corrupt the outcome, said Lamb, who works at Atlanta-based security firm Bastille Networks.  THE BIGGER PICTURE  Though striking, the wayward election server is seen as just part of a much larger problem.  The Department of Homeland Security says 21 states had elections systems scanned or penetrated by Russia-backed hackers last year, though there’s no evidence they altered voting outcomes.  But computer security experts say it’s possible Russians or other malicious actors have sown undetected booby traps in the highly decentralized U.S. voting landscape. In June, a leaked National Security Agency memo showed that 122 elections officials in various states were targeted with phishing emails crafted by Russian agents intent on stealing their passwords.  CALL TO INVESTIGATE  Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr was urged Thursday to investigate. GOP state Rep. Scot Turner: “They should go and look at who did it and why they did it and see ... whether there was criminal intent.” Carr’s office declined comment.  Georgia U.S. Rep Hank Johnson, a Democrat, separately said the server wipe “appears to be a willful and premeditated destruction of evidence” by election officials, adding, “Georgia voters should be as outraged as I am.”  Sara Henderson, executive director of Common Cause Georgia, noted Kemp has repeatedly denied involvement in the university’s decisions on voting machine security.  “Georgia is not creating a climate of voting integrity for our citizens by continuing to blame shift,” Henderson said via email.  ___  Frank Bajak on Twitter: http://twitter.com/fbajak",3.1710526315789473,38,"[3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.5, 1.5, 5.0, 2.5, 2.0, 1.5, 1.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5, 5.0, 2.0, 2.0, 4.0, 2.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.0, 2.0, 1.5, 0.5, 4.0, 2.0, 5.0, 1.0, 0.5, 2.5, 1.0, 4.0, 2.5, 4.5]"

Bush and former head of the Republican Party.(AP Photo/Steve Helber, File)  RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Virginia’s gubernatorial election stands as a test for the anti-Donald Trump resistance, and whether it can energize voters and donors for the less glamorous races featuring traditional Democratic politicians.  The Nov. 7 contest pits Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, a physician, Army veteran and former state senator, against Ed Gillespie, onetime aide to President George W. Bush and former head of the Republican Party. The current governor, Democrat Terry McAuliffe, is term-limited.  The stakes in Virginia are immense: Though Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton won the state by five percentage points in 2016, Republicans typically are more likely to turn out in off-year statewide elections. Northam has led in most polls, but the race is close. A loss would be devastating after Democrats failed to capture any GOP-held seats in contested special congressional elections earlier this year that galvanized anti-Trump activists.  The next Virginia governor also will have a major say in the state’s next congressional redistricting. A Republican wave in statehouse elections around the country in 2010 — just prior to the last redistricting — has helped the GOP maintain a firm grip on the House.  Former President Barack Obama highlighted the importance of the Virginia race last week at his first large political rally since leaving office, urging Democrats not to get “a little sleepy” in the off-year election.  “I think that it’s great that you hashtag and meme,” the former president told a crowd in Richmond, “but I need you to vote.”  Northam bested former Rep. Tom Perriello, a populist favorite of the resistance who was backed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, in the Democratic primary. Sanders’ political operation, Our Revolution, recently endorsed six Democrats running for the state House of Delegates, but did not endorse Northam. Diane May, a spokeswoman for the group, said it can only endorse candidates recommended by local members and none in Virginia recommended Northam.  Some activists say it’s obvious that the liberal wing of the party isn’t as engaged in the governor’s race.  “We absolutely want to see them win, but that’s the difference between inspiring and driving a Democratic base to get out there for you and someone who you just want to win,” said Charles Chamberlain, executive director of the group Democracy For America. “If he doesn’t win, this will be why.”  Fundraising underscores some ambivalence.  Northam has raised $8 million more than Gillespie through September. He had $5.7 million cash on hand at the end of last month compared with Gillespie’s $2.5 million.  But Northam’s fundraising advantage is due largely to his in-state fundraising efforts, not to out-of-state activists pouring money in. Northam and Gillespie have each raised about $2.5 million from out-of-state contributors, not including Washington-based donors like the Democratic Governors Association and its GOP equivalent, according to nonprofit money tracker the Virginia Public Access Project.  And Northam hasn’t reported any donations from Democratic super donors like billionaires George Soros and Donald Sussman who largely funded his primary opponent’s campaign.  Still, others in the resistance say they’re working hard in the governor’s race and see no lack of enthusiasm. The prominent anti-Trump group Indivisible has sent three paid staffers to Virginia and recently asked its chapters across the country to organize phone banks to help Northam and Democrats in the Virginia state legislative races.  “We have folks who are clamoring to make the calls from across the country,” said Isaac Bloom, the group’s organizing director.  Northam spokesman David Turner said the campaign just came off a record-breaking voter canvassing last weekend and “there’s a lot of enthusiasm and excitement on the ground in Virginia.” He said Obama’s visit has helped highlight to out-of-state activists the importance of this race, particularly when it comes to redistricting.  Act Blue, which channels small-dollar donations to Democratic candidates, says that more than triple the number of people have donated to Virginia races this year as did in all of 2013. Democrats have gained six state legislative seats in special elections in Oklahoma, Florida and New Hampshire even as they lost the more headline-drawing congressional elections.  “We’re just seeing people plain engaged,” Act Blue Executive Director Erin Hill said.  The group Flippable has targeted five House of Delegate races in the state and expects to net as many donations as it did for Democrat Jon Ossoff in the Georgia special congressional election he lost earlier this year. Co-founder Catherine Vaughan said Democrats need to re-learn the importance of state elections after losing more than 1,000 state legislative seats and several governor’s races during the Obama years.  “Democrats kind of dropped the ball there,” Vaughan said, adding she worries that in the rush to win back the House in 2018, activists could lose sight of the importance of state-level wins again.  Michael Casentini, 41, a small business owner in Los Angeles, was devastated by Trump’s election and desperate for ways to fight back. In May, he wrote a $215 check to Ossoff as that race became a rallying cry for the anti-Trump resistance.  Casentini obsessively follows the news, so he knows there’s a tight race for Virginia governor next month. But he didn’t know the name of the Democratic candidate.  “People are tired, people are exhausted,” Casentini said in an interview.  But after talking about the Virginia race with a reporter, he said he realized he should make a donation to Northam. “That’s another one we liberals need to jump on,” Casentini said.  ____  Riccardi reported from Denver.",3.6666666666666665,3,"[3.5, 2.5, 5.0]"

(AP Photo/John Minchillo, File)  NEW YORK (AP) — A conservative website with strong ties to the Republican establishment triggered the investigation into Donald Trump’s past that ultimately produced the dossier that alleged a compromised relationship between the president and the Kremlin.  The Washington Free Beacon on Friday confirmed it originally retained the political research firm Fusion GPS to scour then-candidate Trump’s background for negative information, a common practice known as “opposition research” in politics. Leaders from the Free Beacon, which is funded largely by Republican billionaire Paul Singer, insisted none of the early material it collected appeared in the dossier released later in the year detailing explosive allegations, many uncorroborated, about Trump compiled by a former British spy.  “During the 2016 election cycle we retained Fusion GPS to provide research on multiple candidates in the Republican presidential primary, just as we retained other firms to assist in our research into Hillary Clinton,” wrote the site’s editor-in-chief, Matthew Continetti, and chairman Michael Goldfarb. They continued: “The Free Beacon had no knowledge of or connection to the Steele dossier, did not pay for the dossier, and never had contact with, knowledge of, or provided payment for any work performed by Christopher Steele.”  Earlier in the week, reports revealed that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee continued funding Fusion’s work after the original GOP source lost interest.  Trump this week called it a “disgrace” that Democrats had helped pay for research that produced the document. But the original source of the research remained a secret.  The president himself hinted that he knew the Republican source earlier in the week, but he refused to share it. The White House had no immediate comment Friday night about the Free Beacon’s involvement.  The Washington Free Beacon was initially founded as a project of the conservative nonprofit group Center for American Freedom, as an alternative to liberal news sites run by progressive nonprofits. The Center for American Freedom was organized as a 501(c)4 and did not reveal its donors, but Singer was the sole funder of the site as recently as 2014, according to a Republican political veteran familiar with the site. The veteran spoke on condition of anonymity to detail the newspaper’s financial background.  The Free Beacon first retained Fusion to investigate Trump in the fall of 2015 and ended its relationship after Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination in late spring of 2016, according to a person close to Goldfarb, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share private discussions.  The website and its leaders have strong ties throughout the Republican establishment. Goldfarb was deputy communications director on John McCain’s presidential campaign. Singer was backing Florida Sen. Marco Rubio’s presidential bid at the time of the Free Beacon’s involvement. And one of Singer’s closest associates, Republican operative Dan Senor, served as Speaker Ryan’s chief adviser during the 2012 president campaign.  A representative to Singer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Rubio denied any knowledge of the Fusion research or the dossier this week.  “As far as whether it was my campaign, it wasn’t and I’ll tell you why,” he told CNN. “I was running for president. I was trying to win. If I had anything against Donald Trump that was relevant and credible and politically damaging, I would’ve used it. I didn’t have it.”  The document, compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele, emerged this year as a political flashpoint in the broader debate over Trump’s ties to Russia.  A person close to Singer said the billionaire was not aware of Steele’s involvement or the dossier until earlier this year when it was published. The person was not authorized to share internal discussions.  Law enforcement officials have worked to corroborate the dossier’s claims. James Comey, FBI director at the time, advised Trump about the existence of the allegations, and Steele has been questioned as part of an ongoing probe into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump camp.  The U.S. intelligence community has determined that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. election. Special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating the Russian interference and whether it was tied to Trump’s campaign.  The House Intelligence Committee will help verify whether the Free Beacon had any involvement with Steele or his dossier, according to Jack Langer, a spokesman for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes.  “The Beacon has agreed to cooperate with the House Intelligence Committee to help the Committee verify this assertion,” Langer said.  In a statement Saturday, Langer said an agreement had been reached that will secure the committee’s access to Fusion GPS bank records necessary for its investigation.

Edgar Hoover as he talks about the death of Lee Harvey Oswald, released for the first time on Thursday, Oct. 26, 2017, is photographed in Washington.

The government was required by Thursday to release the final batch of files related to Kennedy's assassination in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963. But President Donald Trump delayed the release of some of the files, citing security concerns. (AP Photo/Jon Elswick)  WASHINGTON (AP) — It was a showdown 25 years in the making: With the world itching to finally get a look at classified Kennedy assassination files, and the deadline for their release just hours away, intelligence officials were still angling for a way to keep their secrets. President Donald Trump, the one man able to block the release, did not appreciate their persistence. He did not intend to make this easy.  Like much else surrounding investigations of the 1963 killing of President John F. Kennedy, this week’s release of 2,800 records from the JFK files was anything but smooth. It came together only at the last minute, with White House lawyers still fielding late-arriving requests for additional redactions in the morning and an irritated Trump continuing to resist signing off on the request, according to an account by two White House officials. They spoke only on condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions.  The tale of the final hours before the congressionally mandated 25-year release deadline on Thursday adds a new chapter to the story of Trump’s troubled relationship with his spy agencies. He again flashed his skepticism and unpredictability in dealing with agencies long accustomed to a level of deference. Intelligence officials, meanwhile, were again left scratching their heads about a president whose impulses they cannot predict.  And those officials had their own story tell, some rejecting the notion they were slow to act on Trump’s expectations for the documents. The CIA began work months ago to get its remaining assassination-related documents ready for release on Thursday, according to a person familiar with the process. The person, who was not authorized to publicly to discuss the process and spoke only on condition of anonymity, said the goal was to have all the agency’s documents ready to be released in full or with national security redactions before the deadline.  Since taking office, Trump has challenged the integrity of intelligence leaders, moved to exert more control over U.S. spying agencies and accused his predecessor of using government spycraft to monitor his campaign. In the JFK files matter, one White House official said, Trump wanted to make clear he wouldn’t be bullied by the agencies.  Whatever occurred in the lead-up to deadline day, Trump was irritated Thursday that agencies still were arguing for more redactions. The president earlier in the week had tweeted to tease the release of the documents, heightening the sense of drama on a subject that has sparked the imaginations of conspiracy theorists for decades. Under a 1992 law, all of the records related to the assassination were to be made public unless explicitly withheld by the president.  Just before the release Thursday, Trump wrote in a memorandum that he had “no choice” but to agree to requests from the CIA and FBI to keep thousands of documents secret because of the possibility that releasing the information could still harm national security. Two aides said Trump was upset by what he perceived to be overly broad secrecy requests, adding that the agencies had been explicitly warned about his expectation that redactions be kept to a minimum.  “The president and White House have been very clear with all agencies for weeks: They must be transparent and disclose all information possible,” White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah said Friday.  Late last week, Trump received his first official briefing on the release in an Oval Office meeting that included Chief of Staff John Kelly, White House Counsel Don McGahn and National Security Council legal adviser John Eisenberg. Trump made it clear he was unsatisfied with the pace of declassification.  Trump’s tweets, an official said, were meant as a signal to the intelligence community to take seriously his threats to release the documents in their entirety.  According to White House officials, Trump accepted that some of the records contained references to sensitive sources and methods used by the intelligence community and law enforcement and that declassification could harm American foreign policy interests. But after having the scope of the redactions presented to him, Trump told aides he did not believe them to be in the spirit of the law.  On Thursday, Trump’s top aides presented him with an alternative to simply acquiescing to the agency requests: He could temporarily allow the redactions while ordering the agencies to launch a new comprehensive examination of the records still withheld or redacted in part. Trump accepted the suggestion, ordering that agencies be “extremely circumspect” about keeping the remaining documents secret at the end of the 180-day assessment.  “After strict consultation with General Kelly, the CIA and other agencies, I will be releasing ALL JFK files other than the names and addresses of any mentioned person who is still living,” Trump wrote in a Friday tweet. “I am doing this for reasons of full disclosure, transparency and in order to put any and all conspiracy theories to rest.”  Trump returned to the topic in a Saturday night tweet: “JFK Files are released, long ahead of schedule!” The deadline set by law came Thursday, the day the documents were released.  ___  Associated Press writer Deb Riechmann contributed to this report.",3.8333333333333335,3,"[3.5, 4.0, 4.0]"

(David McKeown/Republican-Herald via AP)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Winter is coming ... later. And it’s leaving ever earlier.  Across the United States, the year’s first freeze has been arriving further and further into the calendar, according to more than a century of measurements from weather stations nationwide.  Scientists say it is yet another sign of the changing climate, and that it has good and bad consequences for the nation. There could be more fruits and vegetables — and also more allergies and pests.  “I’m happy about it,” said Karen Duncan of Streator, Illinois. Her flowers are in bloom because she’s had no frost this year yet, just as she had none last year at this time either. On the other hand, she said just last week it was too hot and buggy to go out — in late October, near Chicago.  The trend of ever later first freezes appears to have started around 1980, according to an analysis by The Associated Press of data from 700 weather stations across the U.S. going back to 1895 compiled by Ken Kunkel, a meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Environmental Information.  To look for nationwide trends, Kunkel compared the first freeze from each of the 700 stations to the station’s average for the 20th Century. Some parts of the country experience earlier or later freezes every year, but on average freezes are coming later.  The average first freeze over the last 10 years, from 2007 to 2016, is a week later than the average from 1971 to 1980, which is before Kunkel said the trend became noticeable.  This year, about 40 percent of the Lower 48 states have had a freeze as of Oct. 23, compared to 65 percent in a normal year, according to Jeff Masters, meteorology director of the private service Weather Underground.  Duncan’s flowers should be dead by now. According to data from the weather station near her in Ottawa, Illinois, the average first freeze for the 20th century was Oct. 15. The normal from 1981 to 2010 based on NOAA computer simulations was Oct. 19. Since 2010, the average first freeze is on Oct. 26. Last year, the first freeze in Ottawa came on Nov. 12.  Last year was “way off the charts” nationwide, Kunkel said. The average first freeze was two weeks later than the 20th century average, and the last frost of spring was nine days earlier than normal.  Overall the United States freeze season of 2016 was more than a month shorter than the freeze season of 1916. It was most extreme in the Pacific Northwest. Oregon’s freeze season was 61 days — two months — shorter than normal.  Global warming has helped push the first frosts later, Kunkel and other scientists said. Also at play, though, are natural short-term changes in air circulation patterns — but they too may be influenced by man-made climate change, they said.  This shrinking freeze season is what climate scientists have long predicted, said University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Jason Furtado.  A shorter freeze season means a longer growing season and less money spent on heat. But it also hurts some plants that require a certain amount of chill, such as Georgia peaches, said Theresa Crimmins, a University of Arizona ecologist. Crimmins is assistant director of the National Phenology Network . Phenology is the study of the seasons and how plants and animals adapt to timing changes.  Pests that attack trees and spread disease aren’t being killed off as early as they normally would be, Crimmins said.  In New England, many trees aren’t changing colors as vibrantly as they normally do or used to because some take cues for when to turn from temperature, said Boston University biology professor Richard Primack.  Clusters of late-emerging monarch butterflies are being found far further north than normal for this time of year, and are unlikely to survive their migration to Mexico.  Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said natural variability, especially an El Nino, made last year exceptional for an early freeze, but “it represents the kind of conditions that will be more routine in a decade or two” because of man-made climate change.  “The long-term consequences are really negative,” said Primack, because shorter winters and hotter temperatures are also expected to lead to rising seas that cause worse flooding during heavy storms.  In suburban Boston, Primack and his wife are still eating lettuce, tomatoes and green beans from their garden. And they are getting fresh figs off their backyard tree almost daily.  “These fig trees should be asleep,” Primack said.  ___  AP data journalist Nicky Forster contributed to this story from New York.

Public education officials in New Mexico have retreated from proposed science standards that would have deleted or omitted references to evolution, human contributions to global warming and Earth's age. (AP Photo/Morgan Lee, file)  SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — Public education officials in New Mexico have retreated from proposed science standards that would have deleted or omitted references to evolution, human contributions to global warming and Earth’s age.  Scores of scientists and engineers from Los Alamos National Laboratory — the birthplace of the atomic bomb that is located in energy-dominant New Mexico — joined a broad backlash against the standards promoted by Republican Gov. Susana Martinez’s administration.  Responding to public outrage, education officials went back this week to a template followed by at least 18 states and designed to make science education more engaging and effective.  ___  WHAT PROMPTED THE FIGHT?  In its first overhaul of science teaching guidelines since 2003, New Mexico relied on Next Generation Science Standards designed by a consortium of states and the National Academy of Sciences.  Public Education Secretary Christopher Ruszkowski proposed a New Mexico-specific version that would ensure “flexibility and local control” for science materials, curriculum and classroom lessons.  That version dropped references to evolution and Earth being 4.6 billion years old. The study of global warming was couched in vague terms of temperature “fluctuations.” It added guidelines for studying the state’s oil and natural gas industry, mining and ski resort snowmaking.  Science teachers associations recognized concessions to those who doubt human-caused climate change and scientific evolutionary theory. More than 60 leading scientists at Los Alamos took out a full-page newspaper ad, pressuring state officials to backtrack.  School boards and business associations described a setback in efforts to prepare students for college and careers.  Hundreds flocked to a public hearing to denounce the plan as teachers unions, faith leaders and Democratic officials protested on the education department’s lawn. Indoors and out, no one spoke in support of the science changes.  ___  WHY ARE SCIENCE STANDARDS DIVISIVE?  The proposal would have left less-experienced teachers at the mercy of personal opinions about climate change from parents and onlookers, said Glenn Branch, deputy director of the nonprofit National Center for Science Education that defends teaching evolution and other science-based classroom subjects.  He said science standards have become a battleground for climate change issues in several states, citing West Virginia as the most prominent example of evasive language in school teaching guidelines.  Plus, in the energy-reliant state of New Mexico, public school districts depend on billions of annual dollars in tax revenue, fees and royalties from the oil and natural gas sector that are channeled through state government.  School administrators in oil-heavy southeastern New Mexico tread lightly on what causes climate change.  “We literally have gas wells right next to our playgrounds,” said T.J. Parks, superintendent of Hobbs Municipal Schools. “I’m certainly not going to throw any stones at the oil industry. That is who we are.”  At the same time, Parks said advanced placement classes and testing dominate teaching decisions about science in his district. In Hobbs, there was no controversy, he said.  Chris Norris, who has two elementary school children in the Santa Fe public schools, said the proposal felt like an assault on scientific theory and the state’s enlightened reputation.  “It bothers me intensely,” he said. “It doesn’t represent us.”  Ruszkowski, the head of public education, said his office developed the tailored science standards during informal conversations with students, teachers and parents. He has declined to name anyone in those discussions.  ___  WHAT WAS THE SOLUTION?  Ruszkowski said Wednesday night that the science standards would not include the contentious changes. The final version trimmed passages about local accomplishments in science and industry from 35 to a half-dozen.  People on both sides claimed a measure of victory, including Ruszkowski for following through on promises to listen to the public.  State Sen. Mimi Stewart of Albuquerque, chairwoman of an influential education committee, expressed pride in the outpouring of public concern — from scientists in particular — noting that the Democratic-controlled Legislature has little authority to intervene in education department decisions on academic standards.",4.029411764705882,17,"[4.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 2.0, 5.0, 4.5, 1.5, 4.0, 3.0, 5.0, 4.0, 2.5, 5.0]"
1117,2695,10,29,2017,2017-10-29,Associated Press News,Indonesia court upholds seizure of illegal fishing vessel," Indonesia says it has won a two-year court battle that confirms the legality of the government’s seizure of a Thai vessel linked to human trafficking and illegal fishing in Indonesian waters.  Minister of Fisheries and Maritime Affairs Susi Pudjiastuti said the “monumental” ruling from a court in Aceh province shows that governments can win in the fight against cross-border crime.  Pudjiastuti said in a statement this week that the ministry plans to make the refrigerated cargo ship Silver Sea 2 part of a museum to teach the public about illegal fishing.  The ship was seized by Indonesia’s navy in August 2015 amid a crackdown on illegal fishing and after an Associated Press investigation showed its links to human trafficking in the fishing industry.  Several months before its capture, the ship and Thai fishing trawlers had abruptly left an island in remote eastern Indonesia, where the Thai fishing industry held trafficked crew members captive, to escape a government crackdown on illegal fishing.  The AP, which was investigating slavery on fishing vessels, subsequently identified where the cargo ship had fled using satellite images from U.S.-based DigitalGlobe that became evidence in the Indonesian government’s court case.  Pudjiastuti said the vessel’s violations included intentionally turning off electronic systems that allowed the ship’s location to be tracked by maritime authorities and other vessels. DNA testing was used to prove that the $1.5 million of fish on board was from Indonesian waters.  When identified in the DigitalGlobe satellite images, the Silver Sea 2 was in Papua New Guinea waters, receiving illegal Indonesian catch from two fishing trawlers in a process known as transshipment.  It was captured by an Indonesian navy vessel off the island of Sumatra after returning to Indonesian waters. The Thai captain was detained and a probe launched into suspected human trafficking, transporting illegal fish and off-loading the catch at sea.  The Pulitzer Prize-winning AP investigation resulted in the freeing of more than 2,000 men from Myanmar, Cambodia, Thailand and Laos, more than a dozen arrests, the changing of U.S. legislation, and lawsuits.

Yoshinaga said Friday the company’s vehicle inspections have been flawed for years, carried out by workers unauthorized to do the task. (Daisuke Suzuki/Kyodo News via AP)  TOKYO (AP) — The head of Japanese automaker Subaru bowed deeply in apology Friday as the company admitted that it has been carrying out flawed inspections of its Japan-made cars for years.  The announcement by Subaru’s chief executive and president, Yasuyuki Yoshinaga, was the latest in a flurry of such scandals. Earlier this month Nissan Motor Co. recalled more than 1 million domestically made cars because of faulty routine tests.  Subaru will submit a report on the problem to the government on Monday, Yoshinaga told reporters. He said a domestic recall is likely, spanning the entire Subaru lineup totaling 255,000 vehicles.  “We are truly sorry, and we apologize,” Yoshinaga said, after bowing deeply. “We all wanted to do the tests properly.”  The government ordered automakers to check their inspection procedures after Nissan apologized for allowing unauthorized employees to do final vehicle checks for years.  The scandals have stunned the public and cast a shadow over this nation’s prized image for “monozukuri” or craftsman-like production, reputed for high quality and meticulousness.  Yoshinaga said the faulty inspections for Subaru’s finished products had been going on for 30 years. The workers involved did not fully realize their method was wrong, and a thorough review of the entire inspection system is needed, he said.  Workers who didn’t have enough experience to do checks borrowed Japanese “hanko” seals from authorized employees and stamped documents to show vehicles had passed the tests, according to the company. The recalls are expected to cost 5 billion yen ($44 million), it said.  Subaru, formerly called Fuji Heavy Industries, is partnered with Toyota Motor Corp., a top shareholder. Toyota and Honda Motor Co. have said they did not have dubious inspections. Toyota said it was checking with Subaru on the reported irregularities.  Nissan is recalling more than a million vehicles in Japan to re-inspect them, and has set up an investigative team that includes a third party to get to the bottom of the scandal and prevent a recurrence.  The problem does not affect Nissan vehicles sold outside Japan and is not believed to have affected vehicle safety as they were final-stage checks.  But the scandal raises serious questions about ethics and professionalism at Nissan, which makes the Leaf electric car and Infiniti luxury models, and is allied with Renault SA of France and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. of Japan.  Reporters peppered Subaru’s Yoshinaga with questions about why it took so long after the Nissan scandal for Subaru to come forward.  “I always wanted to make my company a great company, and I now know we had not done enough,” he said. “I am so ashamed that my company has become a cause for tarnishing Japanese monozukuri.”  The auto industry has been hit by a series of scandals.  Nissan took a controlling stake in Mitsubishi Motors last year after that company was caught inflating fuel economy figures for its minicar models, which are also sold under the Nissan brand.  Japanese supplier Kobe Steel acknowledged recently it had systematically falsified data on its products, including steel, aluminum, copper and other materials, affecting some 500 companies including major global automakers, as well as the aircraft, electronics and railway industries.  Volkswagen AG of Germany acknowledged in 2015 that it had equipped its diesel cars with illegal software that enabled cheating on U.S. emissions tests. Volkswagen has agreed to more than $20 billion in fines and civil settlements over the scandal.  Air-bag maker Takata Corp. filed for bankruptcy protection after some 100 million air-bag inflators were recalled worldwide.

(AP Photo/Koji Sasahara)  NEW YORK (AP) — Some of the biggest companies in the world had their best day in years Friday as Microsoft and Alphabet soared following strong third-quarter reports, as did online retail giant Amazon. U.S. stocks set more records as their winning streak extended to a seventh week.  Intel made its biggest gains in three years, while Microsoft had its biggest jump in two years and Alphabet, Google’s parent company, made its largest move in more than a year after each company’s results were better than Wall Street expected. Amazon jumped 13 percent, its biggest move in two and a half years, after it got a big boost from its latest “Prime Day” promotion and the purchase of the Whole Foods grocery store chain.  “The transition to cloud computing really played a role in all of those tech results to some extent,” said Brad Sorensen, the director of market and sector analysis for the Schwab Center for Financial Research. Technology companies get a lot of their profits outside the U.S. compared to other industries, so the improving global economy is helping them more.  Other stocks were mixed: retailers fell after J.C. Penney cut its annual forecasts. Drugstores, drugmakers, health care suppliers and pharmaceutical distributors and retailers fell.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 20.67 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,581.07. The Dow Jones industrial average made a comparatively modest gain of 33.33 points, or 0.1 percent, to 23,434.19 as drugmaker Merck and oil company Chevron skidded after their third-quarter reports.

Elsewhere Facebook rose $7.25, or 4.2 percent, to $177.88, its largest gain August 2015. Apple advanced $5.64, or 3.6 percent, to $163.05.  Amazon posted strong results and gave an optimistic outlook for the holiday season. Its stock jumped $128.52, or 13.2 percent, to $1,100.95.  Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook are the five most valuable companies on the S&P 500, and with investors clamoring to send them higher, Wall Street didn’t pay quite as much attention to some strong economic data. The Commerce Department estimated that the U.S. economy grew 3 percent between July and September even though the country was hit by two major hurricanes. That was better than analysts had anticipated.  Aside from those giant companies, stocks were mixed. J.C. Penney fell to an all-time low after it cut its profit forecast, saying it’s been lowering prices to try clearing out unsold goods. Its stock lost 54 cents, or 14.8 percent, to $3.12. Other retailers like Macy’s and Foot Locker tumbled as well.  Toy maker Mattel plunged after the company posted a huge third-quarter loss and said it will slash spending and stop paying quarterly dividends. The stock lost $1.37, or 8.9 percent, to $14.  Drugstores and prescription drug distributors fell for a second day following reports that Amazon is receiving state licenses allowing it to do business as a prescription drug wholesaler. Walgreens Boots Alliance lost $2.63, or 3.9 percent, to $64.48 and pharmaceutical distributor McKesson lost $7.92, or 5.5 percent, to $135.62.  However, Jefferies and Co. analyst Brian Tanquilut wrote that Amazon appears to have taken out licenses to sell medical equipment, not drugs. He said the company may stick to medical devices and over-the-counter medicines for now, because in order to distribute prescription drugs Amazon would need to establish relationships with pharmacy benefits managers and health insurers.

The Associated Press has learned the Education Department is considering only partially forgiving federal loans for students defrauded by for-profit-colleges. That would mean abandoning the Obama administration’s policy of fully erasing that debt. Under President Barack Obama, tens of thousands of students deceived by now-defunct for-profit schools had over $550 million in such loans canceled completely. The possible change could leave many students scrambling after expecting full forgiveness. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — The Education Department is considering only partially forgiving federal loans for students defrauded by for-profit colleges, according to department officials, abandoning the Obama administration’s policy of erasing that debt.  Under President Barack Obama, tens of thousands of students deceived by now-defunct for-profit schools had over $550 million in such loans canceled.  But President Donald Trump’s education secretary, Betsy DeVos, is working on a plan that could grant such students just partial relief, according to department officials. The department may look at the average earnings of students in similar programs and schools to determine how much debt to wipe away.  The officials were not authorized to publicly comment on the issue and spoke on condition of anonymity.  If DeVos goes ahead, the change could leave many students scrambling after expecting full loan forgiveness, based on the previous administration’s track record. It was not immediately clear how many students might be affected.  A department spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday.  But the Trump team has given hints of a new approach.  In August, the department extended its contract with a staffing agency to speed up the processing of a backlog of loan forgiveness claims. In the procurement notice, the department said that “policy changes may necessitate certain claims already processed be revisited to assess other attributes.” The department would not further clarify the meaning of that notice.  DeVos’ review prompted an outcry from student loan advocates, who said the idea of giving defrauded students only partial loan relief was unjustified and unfair because many of their classmates had already gotten full loan cancellation. Critics say the Trump administration, which has ties to the for-profit sector, is looking out for industry interests.  Earlier this year, Trump paid $25 million to settle charges his Trump University misled students.  “Anything other than full cancellation is not a valid outcome,” said Eileen Connor, a litigator at Harvard University’s Project on Predatory Student Lending, which has represented hundreds of defrauded students of the now-shuttered Corinthian Colleges. “The nature of the wrong that was done to them, the harm is even bigger than the loans that they have.”  “Even more importantly, it is completely unfair that a happenstance of timing is going to mean that one student who’s been defrauded is going to have full cancellation and the next is not,” Connor said.  A federal regulation known as borrower defense allows students at for-profit colleges and other vocational programs to have their loans forgiven if it is determined that the students were defrauded by the schools. That rule dates to the early 1990s. But it was little used until the demise of Corinthian and ITT for-profit chains in recent years caused tens of thousands of students to request that the government cancel their loans.  In the last few months of the Obama administration, the Education Department updated the rule to add protections for students, shift more financial responsibility onto the schools and prevent schools from having students sign away their right to sue a school.  That change was set to take effect in July, but DeVos has frozen it and is working on a new version. She argued that the Obama regulation was too broad and could cancel the loans of some students without a sound basis.  DeVos has come under criticism for delaying consideration of over 65,000 applications for loan forgiveness under the borrower defense rule. The agency hasn’t approved a single claim since DeVos took office in February.  Jennifer Wang, an expert with the Institute of College Access and Success, said the Obama administration was providing full loan cancellations to students.  “It would be totally different from what was happening under the last administration,” Wang said. “It’s not equitable; it’s not fair for students. If she provides partial relief, it’s that she only cares what’s fair for schools and not students.”  Abby Shafroth, an attorney at the National Consumer Law Center, said the agency could be faced with lawsuits, especially from Corinthian students, whose classmates had received full forgiveness.",3.1984126984126986,63,"[2.5, 4.5, 3.5, 2.0, 4.5, 3.0, 3.0, 1.0, 3.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0, 0.5, 1.5, 1.5, 4.5, 1.5, 2.0, 3.5, 4.0, 2.5, 3.5, 0.5, 5.0, 2.5, 4.5, 3.5, 3.0, 3.0, 4.0, 3.5, 2.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 2.5, 1.5, 4.0, 0.5, 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5, 2.5, 2.0, 4.5, 5.0, 2.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 2.5, 4.5, 3.5, 2.5]"

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is expected to take up the agreement at its next meeting on Nov. 30.  In a statement, Prince Mohammed said that Saudi Arabia “affirms its readiness to extend the production cut agreement, which proved its feasibility by rebalancing supply and demand.”  The effect of the production limits approved by major oil countries has been muted by rising output from U.S. shale-oil producers. The prince said that high demand for oil has absorbed the increased supply from shale oil.  “The journey toward restoring balance to markets, led by the Kingdom, is proving successful despite the challenges,” he said.  On Friday, Brent Crude, the international benchmark oil, rose above $60 for the first time since 2015 as traders grew increasingly confident that OPEC will continue to limit pumping.  The slump in oil prices that began in mid-2014 has created budget problems for Saudi Arabia and other major producers. Prince Mohammed has laid out a sweeping plan to wean Saudi Arabia off its near total dependence on oil exports.  Jim Krane, an energy expert at Rice University in Houston, said Saudi Arabia needs to keep oil prices up to balance its budget and make the upcoming public sale of stock in Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil company, attractive to investors.  “Nobody is going to want a piece of Saudi Aramco with oil under $40, which is where it would be if OPEC wasn’t choking off supply,” he said.  Krane said OPEC cutbacks and higher prices would help boost U.S. production in Texas and North Dakota.",3.524390243902439,41,"[0.5, 3.0, 3.0, 2.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 5.0, 2.5, 2.0, 5.0, 4.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.0, 3.0, 5.0, 4.0, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 1.5, 5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 2.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 1.5, 3.5, 3.5]"

But what exactly defines this middle class, championed and courted for its votes by both sides? Lawmakers and experts have differing views on the numbers. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)  WASHINGTON (AP) — What is middle class?  President Donald Trump and Republican leaders are promoting their tax-cutting plan as needed relief for the stressed American middle class and a catalyst for job creation.  Democrats say they’re the ones looking out for the middle class, by fighting against proposed tax cuts that would benefit big companies and the wealthy but hurt the average American. It’s not easy to exactly define this middle class, whose members are championed and courted for their votes by both sides. Lawmakers and experts have differing views on the numbers.  The Tax Policy Center sets its “middle quintile” — third slice of five — of household income, including tax-exempt employee benefits like health insurance, at $48,300 to $85,600 a year. But be careful about calling that middle class, it says — there’s no formal definition.  Other experts see the middle-income range at around $44,000 to $72,000 (middle quintile), or $72,000 to $112,000 (fourth quintile, both based on 2015 data).  At the high end, Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama, as candidates, defined middle class as earning up to $250,000 a year. That raised eyebrows because it’s in about the top 5 percent of incomes, and the two Democrats had pledged not to raise taxes on the middle class.  The House narrowly passed a GOP budget on Thursday. Speaker Paul Ryan expressed enthusiasm, while Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said it was ""drawing a line in the sand"" between the middle class and extremely wealthy. (Oct. 26)  The median, or midpoint, U.S. household income was $57,617 last year, according to the Census Bureau.  Trump, in his rallying pitches for the far-reaching tax overhaul that is his main legislative priority, sounds the theme constantly. “We will cut taxes for hard-working, middle-class families,” he pledges. “It is time to ignite America’s middle-class miracle once again.”  To fill middle-class stockpots, Trump is promising that the tax cuts would bring a $4,000 or $5,000 pay raise annually for the average family. Skeptical tax experts and Democrats say the claim is based on fuzzy math.  Pro-tax cut troops have fanned out to middle-class neighborhoods around the country with a message to voters on their doorsteps: slashing taxes for corporations would unleash an economic bonanza. The resulting new jobs, faster growth and ample pay raises would help them and everyone else, the residents are told.  “That sort of trickle-down ... is a very hard message,” says James Thurber, professor and founder of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University. “Because of the burden of governing, they (the Republicans) have a problem having an effective messaging system.”  For the opposition Democrats, on the other hand, “It’s easier to have a clear message here that the tax plan would hurt the middle class and the working class,” Thurber suggested.  The nearly $6 trillion tax plan calls for cutting the corporate tax rate from 36 percent to 20 percent, reduced taxes for most individuals, and doubling the standard deduction used by most average Americans to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for families. The number of tax brackets would shrink from seven to three or four, with respective tax rates of 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent and to be determined. Inheritance taxes on multimillion-dollar estates would be repealed.  The middle-class family could take advantage of a heftier child tax credit and the extra money that could come from the bigger standard deduction.  But there are too many holes in the spare nine-page plan, like the income levels tied to each tax bracket and what might happen to other deductions used by middle-class people, to know how it actually would affect individual taxpayers and families.  A chief architect of the plan, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Kevin Brady, was pressed by reporters this past week: Will it truly help the middle class? Can the Republicans guarantee that everyone will get a break, that no ordinary person will end up paying more?  “The elevator goes down at every (income) level. ... I can guarantee that every American will be better off,” said Brady, R-Texas. He acknowledged, though, “It could be that a singular exception exists.”  But mainly Brady’s answer was stay tuned: The proposed income levels to correspond with each tax bracket will soon be revealed.  That’s where the math comes in. Under the current regime of seven brackets, the biggest group of U.S. taxpayers (about 30 percent) falls in the second-lowest bracket, paying a 15 percent tax rate. An individual with taxable annual income between $9,325 and $37,950 is in that group. Because it’s the largest group, some might consider it as standing in for the middle class.  Some critics of the Republican plan say that because it would eliminate the 15 percent bracket, some people who’ve been taxed at 15 percent could be pushed into the next higher bracket, 25 percent.  That’s not yet known, says Daniel Berger, a research associate at the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution. It totally depends on where the plan masters set the income levels.  “It’s theoretically possible that everyone in the 15 percent bracket would go to the lower bracket, the higher bracket, or they would split between the two,” Berger said.  Jared Walczak, a senior policy analyst at the conservative Tax Foundation, notes that an earlier Republican plan floated last year set the 25 percent tax rate for the same income level as currently, $37,950 to $91,900. If the new plan kept that income range unchanged or raised the bottom amount for the 25 percent rate, no one now paying 15 percent would be pushed into a higher rate, Walczak said.",3.236842105263158,76,"[3.0, 4.0, 2.5, 2.5, 2.0, 4.0, 0.5, 4.5, 1.0, 3.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.5, 4.0, 4.5, 2.5, 1.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 3.0, 2.0, 3.5, 2.5, 0.5, 5.0, 4.5, 5.0, 0.5, 3.5, 2.5, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 1.5, 4.0, 2.5, 4.5, 2.5, 0.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.0, 0.5, 2.0, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 1.0, 4.5, 2.5, 3.5, 2.5, 4.5, 3.0, 3.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.0, 3.0, 4.0]"

Thirty two infants were among those moved after the hospital was flooded and lost power. (AP Photo/ John Minchillo, File)  NEW YORK (AP) — Their lives began with one of the most dramatic stories of Superstorm Sandy: the evacuation of 32 newborn babies from a major New York City hospital that got flooded and lost power. Hospital staffers tended to laboring women in the dark and carried mothers and tiny infants — 21 of them in intensive care — down stairways into the thick of the 2012 storm. Doctors and nurses squeezed air pumps by hand to fill some of the most fragile babies’ little lungs.  In the end, every one was delivered to safety.  Five years later, some of those babies are kindergarteners with mementos of the storm in their birthday celebrations, keepsake boxes and even their names. Their parents remember the experience with awe, humor, gratitude and the chagrin of sharing a day of personal joy with a natural disaster.  One mom tells her son: “We were the lucky ones that day.”  ___  Oct. 29, 2012: 9 a.m.  “I know this is the worst possible timing,” Tamar Weinstock said as she woke her husband, Allon, “but I think my water just broke.”  Tamar’s due date was three weeks off. But their first child was coming, and so was Sandy, a 1,000-mile-wide behemoth with nearly 100-mph winds pushing a huge swell of ocean toward the coast of New Jersey and New York. The Weinstocks hurried from their home in the Long Island City section of Queens to NYU Langone Health’s Tisch Hospital, set along the East River in midtown Manhattan.  Five years ago, these little boys were born in New York City as Superstorm Sandy roared up the east coast. Today, their parents remember the experience with an appreciation and gratitude of sharing a day of joy with a natural disaster. (Oct. 26)  “Oh, my God, this is happening in the middle of a hurricane,” thought Tamar, a banker.  “You’re in the best possible place,” staffers reassured her.  With the hospital-room shades pulled down, the couple took in only snatches of the storm from the room’s TV. They noticed the electricity flicker at 7 p.m., but generators kicked in.  Then, at 8:30 p.m., the backup power failed, and the hospital plunged into darkness.  Monitors went silent. Electronics that keep patient records were useless. Elevators stopped.  Labor didn’t. “You just have to keep going with what you’re doing,” Tamar realized.  ---  WORKING AGAINST TIME  NYU Langone had thought it could handle Sandy. After moving out sometimes frail patients before an ultimately uneventful Hurricane Irene in 2011, the hospital was allowed to stay open during Sandy after assuring city officials it had generators and fuel ready.  Then the storm raised the East River by more than 10 feet, crippling a nearby power plant and pouring more than 15 million gallons of water through air vents and other openings into the hospital’s basement. The water triggered sensors that shut off fuel to the generators providing power for 322 patients.  Dr. William Schweizer, the obstetrics safety chief that night, and his colleagues had about 10 patients in labor and others who had just delivered, including one who’d had a premature baby. And the physicians, nurses and aides would have to get them all out of the hospital.  But first, the doctors decided, they would deliver babies who appeared ready to arrive by midnight, rather than risk births in ambulances.  Out came flashlights, emergency glow sticks, and techniques from a less technological era. Doctors would use stethoscopes, along with battery-operated devices, to monitor unborn babies’ heartbeats. Nurses would keep track of contractions with watches, pens and paper.  “We just dealt with our own familiarity with a process that has been going on for as long as mankind has been,” Schweizer said.  “People pulled out of their soul what they could do,” he says.  --  NOTHING ELSE MATTERS  Doctors and nurses gathered by Tamar’s bed. They needed to deliver the baby. Now.  Tamar didn’t feel ready. The staffers rallied her.  At 10:29 p.m., the Weinstocks saw their son for the first time — by flashlight.  “You hear your baby crying for the first time, and nothing else really matters,” says Allon, a construction project manager.  These days, their son Stone is a kindergartener so awesome that Awesome is his unofficial middle name, bestowed by a cousin. Glow sticks are a go-to favor at his birthday parties. Like several other new parents from that night, the Weinstocks credit NYU Langone — which has since undertaken more than $1 billion in floodproofing improvements — with maintaining calm and control in an unforeseen situation.  But the Weinstocks, both of them 37, make sure Stone knows he’s fortunate to be celebrating a day that was catastrophic for many others in New York City. Sandy killed 43 people and damaged or destroyed tens of thousands of homes and apartments.  “You almost feel guilty that for us it’s such a happy moment, because that’s what started our family,” Allon says. “But it’s not lost on us what everybody else went through.”  ___  GET MY BABY BACK  Staffers were in Julz Donald’s darkened room, explaining that the hospital where she’d had daughter Freda that morning was being evacuated. Donald said she could walk out.  “I didn’t actually realize where we were,” the 42-year-old marketing researcher says, chuckling.  They were on the 13th floor — and the stairs were the only way down.  The first families to leave were those whose babies had health issues. Then, around 2 a.m. Donald and husband Mark Potts were escorted by a doctor, nurses, medical students and volunteers down a stairway by flashlight. At the hospital’s insistence, a nurse carried a tightly swaddled Freda.  “Let’s get down these stairs so I can get my baby back,” Donald thought.  Her legs were exhausted by the time they reached a lobby illuminated by the flashing lights of dozens of ambulances — “like a scene out of ‘Die Hard,’” recalls Potts, 38, who works in advertising.  The Long Island City family keeps its hospital-issued flashlight in a “birth box” for Freda, a wry girl who likes Irish dance, writing, beluga whales, the color purple — but not the wind.  ___  CALL ME SANDRA  Dmitry and Daria Shurba were about to take newborn daughter Masha home when they settled on her middle name: Sandra, after the storm.  The Stamford, Connecticut, couple’s second child was born at NYU Langone around noon on the day of the storm. Dmitry, a 42-year-old auto sales manager, was returning from getting celebratory flowers and wine when the power went out, with Daria in a 13th-floor room.  After he got there, the windows rattled so ominously that the family waited in a hallway for its turn to walk down.  The Shurbas figured their daughter should be proud of being born during a historic storm, and she is. She sometimes asks to be called by her middle name, says Daria, 39, an information technology project manager.  “I call her my little hurricane, at times,” Daria says. “She has a great heart and everything, so she’s tough.”  ___  STRONGER THAN THE STORM  Kenneth Hulett III weighed just over 2 pounds (0.9 kilograms), with feet the size of fingernails. He’d just been born 2½ months early, by emergency Caesarian section, and rushed to NYU Langone’s neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU. Doctors had determined he might have a rare and potentially serious genetic disorder.  His parents, Emily Bolton-Blatt and Kenneth Hulett Jr., were still in a recovery room when the power went out. Hulett raced up to the darkened NICU, where he recalls a nurse asking him to watch the numbers displayed on a machine running on backup batteries. So he watched, unsure what the numbers meant, wondering how long the batteries would last, hoping for the best.  “This is a natural disaster happening while our son was just born,” says Hulett, 34, an Army veteran pursuing a computer engineering technology degree. “One of the happiest moments in your life ... but then, with the chaos around it, it’s just all of the emotions mixed into one.”  Then the word came: evacuate.  Worried about Bolton-Blatt but unable to leave their son’s side, Hulett followed the tiny boy, clasped in a nurse’s arms, down nine flights of narrow stairs lined by people with flashlights. The nurse and a doctor pumped air into Kenny’s lungs by squeezing a plastic bulb over and over, as a security guard carried an oxygen tank and two nurses toted monitors.  “Let us get to safety” was Hulett’s only thought as he sloshed through heavy rain to an ambulance.  Kenny would be hospitalized for another three months before coming home to Flushing in Queens.  Now a talkative, engaging kid, he has needed surgeries for a cleft palate but hasn’t been affected by the genetic disorder that was a concern before his birth. He plays with his family’s cat, eyeballs cartoons and giggles occasionally as his parents tells visitors the first chapter of his life story.  For his first birthday, his grandmother had a banner made with a custom message:  “Stronger than the storm.”  ___  Associated Press video journalist Joseph B.

Trump and Vice President Mike Pence came out recently with statements on opioids and humanitarian aid that appear big, bold and immediate. An AP Fact Check finds there’s less than meets the eye to them. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)  WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump and his vice president came out this past week with initiatives that are not as big, bold or immediate as they appeared.  Despite the drum-roll implied in Mike Pence’s recent remarks to Christians, the U.S. is not suddenly walking away from U.N. humanitarian relief programs and switching all that money directly to persecuted religious groups. And Trump’s action on the opioid epidemic counts on a powerful anti-drug punch from advertising, a feeble weapon at least in the past.  A look at their statements and other rhetoric from the week:  TRUMP on a planned ad campaign against the opioid epidemic: “I think that’s going to end up being our most important thing. Really tough, really big, really great advertising, so we get to people before they start.” — remarks Thursday.  THE FACTS: He may prove history wrong, but past marketing efforts to scare young people from using drugs had poor results. More broadly, Trump’s declaration of opioid overdoses as a public health emergency is not as consequential as it might sound. It does not bring new dollars to the anti-opioids fight. It does make it easier for the government to shuffle resources and make other changes, such as expanding access to medical services in rural areas.  U.S. President Donald Trump declares the opioid crisis a nationwide public health emergency - a step that won't bring new dollars to fight a scourge that kills nearly 100 Americans a day but will expand access to medical services in rural areas. (Oct. 26)  As for advertising, the government spent nearly $1 billion from 1998 to 2004 on a campaign to discourage illegal drug use by young people. A study financed by the National Institutes of Health concluded in 2008 that the campaign “had no favorable effects on youths’ behavior” and may have prompted some to experiment with drugs, an unintended “boomerang” effect.  A 2009 review of 20 studies of school-based D.A.R.E. programs found that students in the programs were about as likely to try drugs as those who didn’t. Founded in the early 1980s, D.A.R.E sent police officers into thousands of U.S. schools to warn about the dangers of drugs.  More recently, anti-drug campaigns have appealed to teenagers’ desire for independence and self-control rather than drug fears. A 2011 study of the government’s “Above the Influence” campaign suggested eighth-graders who had seen the campaign were slightly less likely to have tried marijuana than those who had not.  ___  PENCE, on redirecting U.S. humanitarian foreign aid: “While faith-based groups with proven track records and deep roots in these communities are more than willing to assist, the United Nations too often denies their funding requests. My friends, those days are over. ... . Tonight, it is my privilege to announce that President Trump has ordered the State Department to stop funding ineffective relief efforts at the United Nations. And from this day forward, America will provide support directly to persecuted communities through USAID.” — remarks Wednesday to a group helping Christians in the Middle East.  THE FACTS: “From this day forward” is a stretch, as are Pence’s other references to immediate change. The government is to study the matter. Studies take time, especially when multiple agencies are involved, and lead to conclusions that can’t always be foreseen at the start.  State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said not all U.N. relief programs would be cut off from U.S. financing. “The U.N. will still get some of its money for this, but we will look for other avenues in which to more efficiently fund these types of religious minorities so that they can eventually return back home,” Nauert said.  A White House official says the goal is to make sure necessary levels of relief are steered to persecuted religious minorities in the Middle East and as part of that, more grants will go directly to religious organizations and other groups. An analysis will be done by the State Department, U.S. Agency for International Development and the Office of Management and Budget, in conjunction with the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., “to determine how appropriated funds can best be spent,” the official said. This background was shared on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to be identified.  ___  Also from this past week:  TRUMP: “Bob Corker, who helped President O give us the bad Iran Deal & couldn’t get elected dog catcher in Tennessee, is now fighting Tax Cuts....” And: “Corker dropped out of the race in Tennesse when I refused to endorse him, and now is only negative on anything Trump. Look at his record!” — tweets Tuesday.  THE FACTS: Trump, who spelled Tennessee right the first time, continues to label the Republican senator an enabler of the Iran nuclear deal when he was a leading critic of it. Corker had nothing to do with the 2015 international agreement forged by the U.S. and other world powers to constrain Iran’s ability to build a nuclear arsenal. He argued at the time that President Barack Obama should have made the international pact a treaty subject to approval by the Senate. When Obama didn’t do that, Corker helped fellow senators write legislation that subjected the accord to periodic congressional review. The legislation would have blocked the deal if that effort got enough votes. It didn’t. Obama brought the deal into effect, not Congress.  On Corker’s political fate, Trump actually urged Corker to stand for re-election next year during a private meeting in September, the AP learned. And Corker’s chief of staff, Todd Womack, said Trump called Corker after that to ask that he reconsider his decision to leave the Senate. Trump “reaffirmed that he would have endorsed him, as he has said many times,” the aide said. Trump has not substantiated his competing claim that he withheld an endorsement of Corker and that’s why the senator decided to leave Washington.  ___  Trump, on a contract landed by Boeing from Singapore Airlines: “In terms of the orders it’s about $13.8 billion and most importantly it’s about 70,000 jobs.” — at the signing of a “certificate of purchase” staged at the White House on Monday.  THE FACTS: Yes, but.  Boeing says the order will “sustain” more than 70,000 direct and indirect U.S. jobs for the company, its suppliers and others. The company did not say they were new jobs. The estimate of jobs and the value of the contract is based on full list price of the 39 planes Singapore Airlines has agreed to buy. Airlines routinely receive deep discounts from the list price of planes. So the contract, while unquestionably a big one, may end up worth less than $13.8 billion and have a less dramatic effect on employment than billed.  The contract wasn’t as new as it appeared: Singapore Airlines announced Feb. 9 that it signed a letter of intent to order the 39 planes from a U.S. manufacturer. Boeing booked the order in June but did not identify the buyer until this past week. Given the lengthy negotiations involved in airline purchases, it’s clear the order — announced by Singapore Airlines less than three weeks after Trump was sworn in — largely came together when Barack Obama was president. It’s unlikely either president had much to do with it.  ___  Associated Press writers Darlene Superville, Josh Lederman, Ken Thomas, Jill Colvin and Matthew Perrone in Washington and David Koenig in Dallas contributed to this report.  ___  Find AP Fact Checks at https://apnews.com/tag/APFactCheck",3.65,10,"[2.5, 4.5, 4.0, 2.5, 2.5, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 0.5]"

In the 20th century, abuse outbreaks of cocaine, heroin, and other drugs like methamphetamine, would emerge and then fall back. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan)  NEW YORK (AP) — While declaring the opioid crisis a national public health emergency Thursday, President Donald Trump said: “Nobody has seen anything like what’s going on now.”  He was right, and he was wrong.  Yes, this is the most widespread and deadly drug crisis in the nation’s history. But there has been a long string of other such epidemics, each sharing chilling similarities with today’s unfolding tragedy.  There was an outbreak after the Civil War when soldiers and others became addicted to a new pharmaceutical called morphine, one of the first of many man-made opioids. There was another in the early 1900s after a different drug was developed to help “cure” morphine addiction. It was called heroin.  Cocaine was also developed by drugmakers and sold to help morphine addiction. It cleared nasal passages, too, and became the official remedy of the Hay Fever Association. In 1910, President William H. Taft told Congress that cocaine was the most serious drug problem the nation had ever faced.  Over the next century, abuse outbreaks of cocaine, heroin, and other drugs like methamphetamine, marketed as a diet drug, would emerge and then fall back.  “There are one or two or three wolves ahead of the pack that seem to be the most pressing threat, their jaws closest to you,” said David Courtwright, a University of North Florida historian who has written books on U.S. drug epidemics. “But there’s always a pack. The history is that the lead wolves keep shifting.”  Trump vowed in his recent remarks “we will free our nation from the terrible affliction of drug abuse.” But the grim reality is that these drugs never disappear completely once they’ve emerged.  The good news, though, is that drug epidemics do fade considerably — usually because reduced supply and demand eventually diminish the number of new addictions, experts say. And that history offers some hope for the future.  The following message will be displayed to users with unsupported browsers: Your browser does not support the iframe HTML tag. Try viewing this in a modern browser like Chrome, Safari, Firefox or Internet Explorer 9 or later.  THE 1800s: BETTER — AND MORE DANGEROUS — MEDICINES  Most U.S. drug epidemics over the past two centuries were sparked by pharmaceutical companies and physicians pushing products that gradually proved to be addictive and dangerous. In the 1800s the drug was often opium, usually sold as a liquid in products like laudanum, and given to patients for pain or trouble sleeping. Mary Todd Lincoln, President Lincoln’s wife, took it for headaches and became addicted.  The drug was also used to get high. “Opium fiends” smoked it in opium dens like those in San Francisco’s Chinatown. Rev. Frederick Masters, a 19th century Methodist missionary, described opium dens in that city as dark, fumy basements “sepulcher-like in their silence save for the sputtering of opium pipes or the heavy breathing of their sleeping victims.”  The young nation’s drug problem grew because of morphine, a painkiller derived from opium through a chemical process that was perfected by E. Merck & Company of Germany. It made battlefield injuries more bearable for Civil War soldiers, but so many veterans got hooked that morphine addiction was sometimes called “the army disease.”  It would get worse. Cocaine and heroin were soon developed — in part to help morphine addiction.  Merck introduced cocaine, which became a prime ingredient in a variety of over-the-counter tonics for sinus problems and other ailments. Because of its energizing effects, beverage makers put it in their wines and sodas and laborers in the South sniffed it to get through grueling work shifts.  Bayer, another German pharmaceutical company, began marketing heroin in the 1890s. It often came in pill form, without prescription, and was used to treat the flu and respiratory ailments. But it came to be sniffed — and later injected — by those looking for a more intense high or a substitute for other drugs, whether it was morphine in 1905 or opioid pain pills like Vicodin in 2015.  THE EARLY 1900S: FROM CURE TO CURSE  In the early 1900s cocaine shifted from a consumer fad into reviled epidemic, as physicians began documenting addiction problems and police chiefs linked recreational cocaine use to prostitution and violent crime. It led to the first national effort to contain a drug epidemic: In 1914, Congress passed the Harrison Act, which said cocaine and heroin could be sold only as a prescription medicine, not in over-the-counter remedies or in consumer products.  Historians believe a growing stigma attached to cocaine use was the main reason the epidemic declined, but they say enforcement of the Harrison Act — and its impact on prices — also was important. Cocaine and heroin got much more expensive when they were driven underground.  Drugs were still abused in the later years in pockets of society — cocaine use was rampant in Hollywood in the 1920s, for example. But economics and politics helped prevent large-scale epidemics for a time. The Great Depression meant few had the disposable income for an illicit drug habit, and World War II decimated the supply of drugs from overseas.  “There’s no customs patrol more efficient than a U-boat,” said Courtwright, the University of North Florida historian.  MID- 20TH CENTURY: THE FIRST WAR ON DRUGS  Alcohol and cigarettes were — and remain — the nation’s primary addictions. Both kill far more people than drugs. But since the middle of the century, there’s been wave after wave of other drug abuse outbreaks.  Amphetamines, developed in the 1930s, took off in the 1950s. Marketed by drug companies and promoted by doctors, they were used for weight loss, anxiety and depression. Methamphetamine, developed by the Burroughs Wellcome drug company, was often prescribed as a diet pill and abused by those attracted by the surge of energy it produced. Users who injected it were known as “speed freaks.”  “The speed freak is, in many ways, an outcast in a society of outcasts. He is regarded as a fool by heroin addicts, as insane and violent by those using psychedelics and marijuana, and a ‘bust’ by non-drug using hustlers,” wrote Dr. Roger Smith, a criminologist who studied drug use in San Francisco in the late 1960s.  Greater regulation of the drugs in 1970, along with the stigma attached to speed freaks, caused the drugs to recede as others became more widely used.  In the 1960s and 1970s, heroin use surged, prompted in part by Vietnam War soldiers who were exposed to it while fighting overseas. Unlike the doctor-driven previous drug epidemics, this one victimized poor inner-city neighborhoods most.  In 1970 and 1971, in New York City, more adolescents, many of them black and Puerto Rican, died of heroin-related incidents than any other cause. There was little compassion then for heroin addicts, recalled John de Miranda, a longtime addiction professional who worked with homeless men in Boston’s South End in the early 1970s. “We basically cared for the men nobody else wanted to deal with,” he said.  President Richard Nixon’s 1971 “war on drugs” declaration kicked off a long period of attacking the drug problem with beefed up law enforcement and tougher sentences for users and dealers. The approach did cut down foreign shipments of heroin and marijuana, but those successes were temporary and many historians argue Nixon’s war ultimately was a losing effort.  LATE 20TH CENTURY: COCAINE ON HIGH  Heroin use faded in the late ’70s, but cocaine was on its way back, first in powder form and then becoming an epidemic of crack in the 1980s when a supply glut prompted dealers to sell hardened cocaine rocks that sold for $5 to $10 on the street.  Many young thrill-seekers, wary of heroin and needles, thought crack was less dangerous because it was smoked like marijuana.  Like the heroin surge before it, crack was seen as tied to urban blight and violent crime. This triggered a new drug war, including the “this is your brain on drugs” TV spots that showed frying eggs, and harsh jail sentences for the sale and possession of crack that were far more severe than the penalties for regular cocaine.  The crack epidemic died out in the 1990s, tailing off at roughly the same time both in cities that aggressively arrested people and cities that didn’t. Experts said the police crackdown contributed, but more important was society’s growing repulsion to the drugs. Families and communities were shattered by crack-related murders and arrests. The drug’s users came to be regarded as disgraceful “crackheads.” Even risk-taking kids, looking for new highs, started to avoid crack.  TODAY’S OPIOID EPIDEMIC  In 1900, when cocaine and heroin were legal and popular, there were 250,000 Americans with a drug addiction, according to one historical estimate. That was about 1 in 300 Americans. The estimate today is 1 in 133, and the drugs are deadlier than ever.  “In all my years I’ve worked in the substance abuse field, I’ve never had so many patients die,” said Joan Hartman, vice president of behavioral health services for Illinois-based Chestnut Health Systems, who has been working in treatment for three decades.  There were fewer than 3,000 overdose deaths in 1970, when a heroin epidemic was raging in U.S. cities. There were fewer than 5,000 recorded in 1988, around the height of the crack epidemic.  More than 64,000 Americans died from drug overdoses last year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  This epidemic started around 1995, kicked off by a drug called OxyContin, which like heroin and morphine before it, was meant to be a safer and more effective opioid. OxyContin and competitor drugs were designed to release the medication slowly over long periods of time, making them and supposedly safe and effective enough to use for months to treat chronic pain. But patients found themselves hooked and wanting more, and drug abusers found they could crush the tablets and snort or inject them, delivering the drug to the bloodstream much more quickly.  Aggressive marketing and distribution pushed hundreds of millions of pills into communities. Then more and more addicts turned to cheaper alternatives, bought illegally, like heroin and fentanyl, an opioid medication developed to treat intense, end-of-life pain in cancer patients that is 50 to 100 times more powerful than morphine.  “It’s a very complex epidemic” that is nowhere close to being over, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, the CDC’s principal deputy director, in an interview earlier this year.  LESSONS OF THE PAST  What has worked for previous epidemics?  The supply is often reduced by a combination of regulations, law enforcement and economics. And historians say that demand slows when drug users became so outcast that even those looking for a risky thrill or a way to escape began to stay away.  Past epidemics have also shown what doesn’t work. Many experts, including some in law enforcement, say that arresting users and dealers does not seem to slow epidemics. “We cannot arrest our way out of the heroin and opioid addiction crisis,” said Brian Moran, Virginia’s secretary of public safety and homeland security, speaking at a federal hearing in July.  But while health experts want to urge people to shun drugs to reduce the number of new addictions, they say ostracizing the people already suffering from addiction does little to help them. It may even impede attempts to get people into treatment, Hartman said.  Health officials are fighting the current epidemic on three fronts: Preventing overdose deaths, helping people recover from addiction, and preventing new addictions.  There appears to be some success on the first front. The number of new addictions may be receding.  A recent federal report noted a downward trend in “opioid misuse” in adults younger than 50. Prescription rates are falling, though they remain far higher than years ago. And according to a closely watched University of Michigan study of adolescents, use of the opioids OxyContin and Vicodin has been low and falling for several years. In 2016, heroin use was the lowest in the survey’s 41-year history.  “I suspect we may be past the peak (of the epidemic), at least in terms of initiation,” said Jonathan Caulkins, a drug policy scholar at Carnegie Mellon University.  The other two fronts — preventing deaths and treating addiction — are not so promising, despite more attention and money flowing to programs. Deaths are still rising, and University of Pittsburgh researchers estimate as many as 300,000 will die from overdoses over the next five years.  “Honestly, we’re at a point where the horses are out of the barn after the gate has closed,” said Dan Werb, an expert at the University of California, San Diego. “I’m not optimistic about the capacity of our classic approaches to rein this in.”",4.45,10,"[4.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0]"

Bush and former head of the Republican Party.(AP Photo/Steve Helber, File)  RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Virginia’s gubernatorial election stands as a test for the anti-Donald Trump resistance, and whether it can energize voters and donors for the less glamorous races featuring traditional Democratic politicians.  The Nov. 7 contest pits Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, a physician, Army veteran and former state senator, against Ed Gillespie, onetime aide to President George W. Bush and former head of the Republican Party. The current governor, Democrat Terry McAuliffe, is term-limited.  The stakes in Virginia are immense: Though Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton won the state by five percentage points in 2016, Republicans typically are more likely to turn out in off-year statewide elections. Northam has led in most polls, but the race is close. A loss would be devastating after Democrats failed to capture any GOP-held seats in contested special congressional elections earlier this year that galvanized anti-Trump activists.  The next Virginia governor also will have a major say in the state’s next congressional redistricting. A Republican wave in statehouse elections around the country in 2010 — just prior to the last redistricting — has helped the GOP maintain a firm grip on the House.  Former President Barack Obama highlighted the importance of the Virginia race last week at his first large political rally since leaving office, urging Democrats not to get “a little sleepy” in the off-year election.  “I think that it’s great that you hashtag and meme,” the former president told a crowd in Richmond, “but I need you to vote.”  Northam bested former Rep. Tom Perriello, a populist favorite of the resistance who was backed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, in the Democratic primary. Sanders’ political operation, Our Revolution, recently endorsed six Democrats running for the state House of Delegates, but did not endorse Northam. Diane May, a spokeswoman for the group, said it can only endorse candidates recommended by local members and none in Virginia recommended Northam.  Some activists say it’s obvious that the liberal wing of the party isn’t as engaged in the governor’s race.  “We absolutely want to see them win, but that’s the difference between inspiring and driving a Democratic base to get out there for you and someone who you just want to win,” said Charles Chamberlain, executive director of the group Democracy For America. “If he doesn’t win, this will be why.”  Fundraising underscores some ambivalence.  Northam has raised $8 million more than Gillespie through September. He had $5.7 million cash on hand at the end of last month compared with Gillespie’s $2.5 million.  But Northam’s fundraising advantage is due largely to his in-state fundraising efforts, not to out-of-state activists pouring money in. Northam and Gillespie have each raised about $2.5 million from out-of-state contributors, not including Washington-based donors like the Democratic Governors Association and its GOP equivalent, according to nonprofit money tracker the Virginia Public Access Project.  And Northam hasn’t reported any donations from Democratic super donors like billionaires George Soros and Donald Sussman who largely funded his primary opponent’s campaign.  Still, others in the resistance say they’re working hard in the governor’s race and see no lack of enthusiasm. The prominent anti-Trump group Indivisible has sent three paid staffers to Virginia and recently asked its chapters across the country to organize phone banks to help Northam and Democrats in the Virginia state legislative races.  “We have folks who are clamoring to make the calls from across the country,” said Isaac Bloom, the group’s organizing director.  Northam spokesman David Turner said the campaign just came off a record-breaking voter canvassing last weekend and “there’s a lot of enthusiasm and excitement on the ground in Virginia.” He said Obama’s visit has helped highlight to out-of-state activists the importance of this race, particularly when it comes to redistricting.  Act Blue, which channels small-dollar donations to Democratic candidates, says that more than triple the number of people have donated to Virginia races this year as did in all of 2013. Democrats have gained six state legislative seats in special elections in Oklahoma, Florida and New Hampshire even as they lost the more headline-drawing congressional elections.  “We’re just seeing people plain engaged,” Act Blue Executive Director Erin Hill said.  The group Flippable has targeted five House of Delegate races in the state and expects to net as many donations as it did for Democrat Jon Ossoff in the Georgia special congressional election he lost earlier this year. Co-founder Catherine Vaughan said Democrats need to re-learn the importance of state elections after losing more than 1,000 state legislative seats and several governor’s races during the Obama years.  “Democrats kind of dropped the ball there,” Vaughan said, adding she worries that in the rush to win back the House in 2018, activists could lose sight of the importance of state-level wins again.  Michael Casentini, 41, a small business owner in Los Angeles, was devastated by Trump’s election and desperate for ways to fight back. In May, he wrote a $215 check to Ossoff as that race became a rallying cry for the anti-Trump resistance.  Casentini obsessively follows the news, so he knows there’s a tight race for Virginia governor next month. But he didn’t know the name of the Democratic candidate.  “People are tired, people are exhausted,” Casentini said in an interview.  But after talking about the Virginia race with a reporter, he said he realized he should make a donation to Northam. “That’s another one we liberals need to jump on,” Casentini said.  ____  Riccardi reported from Denver.",3.111111111111111,9,"[2.5, 3.0, 2.5, 3.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.5, 4.0, 3.0]"

(Courtesy of Eric Paddock via AP, File)  LAS VEGAS (AP) — Scientists are preparing to do a microscopic study of the Las Vegas gunman’s brain, but whatever they find, if anything, likely won’t be what led him to kill 58 people in the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history, experts said.  Stephen Paddock’s brain is being sent to Stanford University for a months-long examination after a visual inspection during an autopsy found no abnormalities, Las Vegas authorities said.  Doctors will perform multiple forensic analyses, including an exam of the 64-year-old’s brain tissue to find any possible neurological problems.  The brain will arrive in California soon, and Stanford has been instructed to spare no expense for the work, The New York Times reported. It will be further dissected to determine if Paddock suffered from health problems such as strokes, blood vessel diseases, tumors, some types of epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, degenerative disorders, physical trauma and infections.  Dr. Hannes Vogel, Stanford University Medical Center’s director of neuropathology, would not discuss the procedure with The Associated Press and referred questions to officials in Clark County, where Las Vegas is located. They also refused to provide details.  Vogel told The Times that he will leave nothing overlooked to put to rest much of the speculation on Paddock’s health as investigators struggle to identify a motive for the shooting.  The examination will come about a month after Paddock unleashed more than a thousand bullets through the windows of a 32nd floor suite at the Mandalay Bay casino-hotel into a crowd below attending an outdoor country music festival. After killing 58 people and wounding hundreds more, Paddock took his own life with a shot through his mouth, police say.  Investigators working around the clock remain frustrated by a lack of clues that would point to his motive. Authorities have resorted to putting up billboards in southern Nevada seeking tips and now the intensive brain study that medical experts say likely won’t yield definitive answers.  If a disease is found, experts say it would be false science to conclude it caused or perhaps even contributed to the massacre, even if that explanation would ease the minds of investigators and the world at large.  “There’s a difference between association and causality, and just because you have anything, doesn’t mean it does anything,” said Brian Peterson, president of the National Association of Medical Examiners and chief coroner of Wisconsin’s Milwaukee County.  The microscopic study is not a standard practice but is regularly used as needed. Families sometimes request such a detailed examination to better understand their own genetic risks.  Peterson said it’s also common in high-profile cases such as Paddock’s, where so much is riding on the results that all forensic options must be exhausted.  Douglas Fields, a neuroscientist who studies the rage circuit in brain systems, said horribly violent events, such as mass shootings and terrorism, rarely involve actual brain abnormalities but can be triggered by psychiatric problems.  Perpetrators often are suicidal psychopaths who are motivated to commit heinous crimes because they have internalized their isolation and anti-social behavior as an existential threat for themselves, he said.  “When police look for motive, it’s kind of misplaced in cases like this because they appear to be crimes of rage. There’s no motive for crimes of rage. It’s a crime of passion,” Fields said.  One such case involved the University of Texas shooter Charles Whitman, who fatally shot 13 people in 1966 from a clock tower on the Austin campus. Whitman was found to have a pecan-sized tumor in his brain, though the suggestion that it caused his rampage is still debated decades later.  Peterson, who is not involved in the Paddock case, said an initial inspection that is standard for any autopsy would generally include dissecting the brain at one-centimeter intervals to look for issues identifiable to the trained eye — infection, tumor, symmetry, bleeding and blood vessel abnormality.  A further study would involve a microscopic focus on the tissue cells, such as using stains to determine different types of dementia and other degenerative diseases, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which is sometimes found in people who have suffered repetitive brain trauma.  There also would likely be a review of the brain at a molecular level though DNA, Peterson said.  Experts say the brain study on Paddock will be a worthy effort for scientific reasons.  Dr. Paul S. Appelbaum, a psychiatry expert at Columbia University, said that at minimum, it might yield something even tangential that can be passed on to the public, such as awareness for psychological disorders or brain diseases.  “Are we ever going to know for certain what caused his brain to do that?” Appelbaum asked. “Probably not from a neuropathological examination, but it’s not unreasonable to ask and see whether it might contribute to our understanding of what occurred.”  ___  Follow Sally Ho at https://twitter.com/_sallyho.",3.9285714285714284,7,"[4.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.0, 2.5, 3.0, 5.0]"

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Top U.S. national security officials on Monday warned congressional Republicans and Democrats demanding a new war authorization that existing laws governing combat operations against terrorist groups are legally sufficient and that repealing them prematurely could signal the United States is backing away from the fight.  During testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis urged Congress to tread carefully. If lawmakers are compelled to replace the post-Sept. 11, 2001, laws, the two secretaries cautioned them against imposing restrictions and conditions on American military forces that allow their enemies “to seize the initiative.”  Tillerson and Mattis said President Donald Trump doesn’t have permission from Congress to attack North Korea, but they indicated the U.S. Constitution gives him that power in certain circumstances where U.S. citizens and national security interests are being imminently threatened.  The response troubled several Democrats who have expressed concerns over Trump’s confrontational statements toward North Korea and its budding arsenal of nuclear weapons. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., asked if the act of possessing a nuclear weapon capable of striking the U.S. qualified as an imminent threat, but both witnesses declined to answer.  Senior U.S. national security officials told Congress a new war authorization is not needed to conduct combat operations against terrorist groups and warned repealing current law could signal the U.S. will give up the fight. (Oct. 30)  “Secretaries Tillerson and Mattis’s responses to my questions about the Administration’s war powers in North Korea were very worrying,” Murphy said. “The fact is, no president has unlimited power to start a war without congressional approval.”  Murphy and several other Democrats are planning to introduce legislation that would prohibit Trump from starting a pre-emptive war against North Korea, absent an imminent threat or without express authorization from Congress.  The testimony from Tillerson and Mattis came as the deadly ambush in Niger earlier this month is igniting a push among many lawmakers to update the legal parameters for combat operations overseas.  Roughly 800 U.S. service members are in Niger as part of a French-led mission to defeat the extremists in West Africa. There are hundreds more American forces in other African countries.  The bulk of the nearly three-hour hearing centered on arcane but crucial laws known as authorization for use of military force. One, to fight al-Qaida, was approved a week after the Sept. 11 attacks. A separate authorization for the war in Iraq approved by Congress in 2002 also remains in force.  Tillerson and Mattis said if Congress does pursue a new authorization for foes such as Islamic State militants, it’s imperative the existing laws not be rescinded until a new one is fully in place. Tillerson and Mattis also said any new war authorization, like the existing ones, should not have any geographic or time restrictions so as not to tip the enemy off.  “We cannot put a firm timeline on a conflict against an adaptive enemy who would hope that we haven’t the will to fight as long as necessary,” Mattis said. “Instead we must recognize that we are in an era of frequent skirmishing, and we are more likely to end this fight sooner if we don’t tell our adversary the day we intend to stop fighting.”  A growing number of congressional Republicans and Democrats, many of whom were startled by the depth of the U.S. commitment in Niger and other parts of Africa, have been demanding a new war authorization. They’ve argued that the dynamics of the battlefield have shifted over the past 16 years and it’s past time to replace the post-Sept. 11 authorization to fight al-Qaida with a law that reflects current threats.  Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., highlighted the fact that none of the 21 members of the committee were members of the Senate when the 2001 war authorization was approved. Flake and Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., are sponsoring legislation for a new war authority for operations against the Islamic State group, al-Qaida and the Taliban.  Flake said he understood the reluctance expressed by Mattis and Tillerson not to telegraph when U.S. troops might depart a particular war zone. But he said that concern is “overwhelmed in a big way by not having Congress buy in, and us not having skin in the game.”  “It simply allows us to criticize the administration, Republican or Democrat, if we don’t like what they’re doing because we haven’t weighed in,” Flake said.  U.S. troops also are battling an enemy — Islamic State militants — that didn’t exist 16 years ago in a country — Syria — that the U.S. didn’t expect to be fighting in. Nor did the 2001 authorization anticipate military confrontations with the Syrian government. Trump in April ordered the firing of dozens of Tomahawk missiles at an air base in central Syria, and American forces in June shot down a Syrian Air Force fighter jet.  Beyond that, Trump has approved a troop increase in Afghanistan, the site of America’s longest war, and the U.S. backs a Saudi Arabia-led coalition carrying out airstrikes in Yemen.  But previous attempts to ditch the old authorization and force Congress to craft a new one have failed.  “So far, Congress has been unable to bridge the gap between those who see a new (war authorization) as primarily an opportunity to limit the president and those who believe constraining the commander in chief in wartime is unwise,” said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., the committee chairman. “And unfortunately, the inability to reconcile this divide without threatening the existing authorization has allowed the status quo to prevail.”  ___  Associated Press writers Andrew Taylor and Josh Lederman contributed to this report.  ___  Follow Richard Lardner on Twitter at http://twitter.com/rplardner",3.409090909090909,11,"[5.0, 0.5, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0, 1.5, 0.5]"

Attorneys for both defendants filed papers with the court Sunday, Oct. 29. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig)  NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — The defense in the bribery trial of U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez rested its case Monday, shortly after the judge turned down a bid to have a mistrial declared over his rulings during the trial.  Neither the Democratic senator from New Jersey nor co-defendant Salomon Melgen, a Florida eye doctor, testified during the trial, which in its ninth week. Closing arguments are expected later this week after the judge and attorneys settle on instructions for the jury.  An indictment charges Menendez and Melgen with a long-running bribery scheme in which Menendez allegedly traded political influence for gifts including flights on Melgen’s private jet between the U.S. and Melgen’s home at a Dominican Republic resort.  Both men have claimed the gifts were an expression of their longtime friendship, and that there was no bribery arrangement.  The most serious charge they face, honest services fraud, carries a maximum 20-year prison sentence.  Among witnesses the defense team called were two U.S. senators — Republican Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who has known Menendez for more than two decades, and Democrat Cory Booker, who represents New Jersey alongside Menendez.  Both testified last week that they knew Menendez to be honest and trustworthy.  On Monday, U.S. District Judge William Walls began by chastising defense attorneys for a mistrial request he said was devoid of “even palpable merit.”  Attorneys had accused Walls during a weekend filing of tying their hands by limiting what evidence and witnesses they could present to the jury.  The filing alleged Walls’ rulings deprived the defendants “of their Fifth and Sixth Amendments rights to a fair trial, to an adequate defense, and to confront the witnesses against them.”  In strongly worded remarks Monday, Walls chided the defense for “failing to acknowledge that they are bound by the rules of evidence.  “There’s not even palpable merit to what you wish,” he added.  Central to an indictment that charges the men with bribery, fraud and conspiracy is that in return for the gifts, Menendez pressured executive branch officials to help the ophthalmologist with his $8.9 million Medicare billing dispute and with a stalled port screening contract in the Dominican Republic.  Defense attorneys alleged they weren’t allowed to introduce evidence that would show Menendez’s intent in meeting with those officials was to discuss broad policy issues and not Melgen’s specific concerns.  Walls frequently has justified his rulings by saying the defense’s evidence is either irrelevant or repetitive and that Melgen’s disputes aren’t an issue for the jury to decide — only whether a bribery arrangement existed.  On Monday, the judge didn’t budge.  The defense “wants to spend morning, noon and night” discussing details of the port contract and the Medicare dispute,” he said. “It’s a question for this court to determine when enough is enough.”  Walls already has denied previous requests to have the case thrown out, most recently two weeks ago when defense attorneys alleged prosecutors hadn’t proved evidence of bribery under a narrowed definition of the crime stemming from a U.S. Supreme Court decision last year.  That decision, which overturned the conviction of former Republican Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, will weigh heavily over the instructions Walls give to jurors this week.  The McDonnell decision has led courts to overturn the convictions of at least three other public officials in recent months, including former Democratic U.S. Rep. William Jefferson of Louisiana, primarily based on the content of the jury instructions.",3.3333333333333335,3,"[5.0, 4.5, 0.5]"

Health care consumers in most of the country are encountering a world of confusion and chaos as the open enrollment period to sign up for coverage approaches. The outlook is decidedly different in the 12 states that operate their own marketplaces. California, Colorado, Minnesota and other states that operate autonomous exchanges are pulling out all the stops to inform consumers. Briva Health is MNsure's largest enrollment partner. (AP Photo/Jim Mone)  ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — The Trump administration’s efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act have health care advocates and insurers concerned that the open enrollment period will be one of chaos and confusion.  That’s not true everywhere.  A dozen states operate their own health insurance marketplaces, maintaining control over advertising and the help they can offer consumers. That will create a striking difference when open enrollment begins Wednesday between those states and the others that rely on the federal marketplace, essentially creating a tale of two countries.  For the individual health insurance market in much of the country, the Trump administration has slashed spending on advertising by 90 percent and drastically reduced budgets for the groups that help consumers choose a plan.  It cut the open enrollment period in half, to six weeks. Shortening the sign-up window further, the federal government will shut down its online marketplace, healthcare.gov, for 12 hours of maintenance nearly every Sunday during open enrollment.  The 12 states with their own exchanges are free to chart their own course and make it easier on consumers.  Nine have extended open enrollment beyond Dec. 15 — by a week in some states and six weeks in others.  They also can make their own decisions about spending because their budgets are free from Washington politics. State-run exchanges typically pay for their operations through fees charged to insurers on plans sold through their marketplace.  Minnesota, Colorado and Washington will continue heavy advertising for their exchanges. Thousands of enrollment specialists will continue to help consumers navigate insurance plans in California and New York.  For many of these states, 2018 looks like a payoff for the political risks and costs they assumed when they decided to set up their own exchanges.  “When I think about what’s going on at the federal level, I’m sure glad we have the reins here at the state,” said Allison O’Toole, director of Minnesota’s health insurance exchange, MNsure.  With the help of a separate and costly state program that is keeping premiums stable for 2018, O’Toole said she thinks Minnesota’s exchange may be on track for its best year yet.  No state is totally immune from the spikes in insurance premiums since the health care overhaul launched in 2014.  Many states are bracing for double-digit rate hikes in the individual market, from an average increase of 12.5 percent in California to jumps of roughly 45 percent in Florida and nearly 60 percent in Iowa. Premiums for the most popular plans are up 34 percent nationwide, on average.  Millions of shoppers, whether they buy coverage on HealthCare.gov or through their state’s marketplace, will see another modest spike after Trump’s decision earlier this month to halt payments to insurers that help cover some consumers’ deductibles and co-pays. Trump called those cost-sharing payments “bailouts” to insurance companies.  The federal subsidy on actual premiums remains, but some state officials are concerned that consumers will be confused and believe those, too, have been eliminated. The worry is that they simply would not bother to shop for a plan, thinking they couldn’t afford it. About 12 million Americans buy individual overage on the exchanges, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.  The morning after Trump’s Oct. 12 announcement, Colorado’s Connect for Health exchange sent an email blast to current and prospective enrollees, stressing that “financial help is still available for 2018.”  That’s the kind of autonomy that gives states with an independent marketplace an upper-hand, said Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.  “That’s where state-based exchanges are maybe in the best position to help stabilize markets, by just putting extra resources into educating consumers in a very confusing time,” he said. “They have the ability to dial that up at times like this.”  Amid the changes at the federal level, California is staying the course. As always, open enrollment on Covered California, the state marketplace, will run through January.  Its $66 million advertising budget is steady from last year — and more than six times the total that HealthCare.gov will spend in all 38 states it covers.  Peter Lee, Covered California’s executive director, was perplexed by the Trump administration’s decision to gut advertising spending. With premiums on the rise and confusion mounting, promotion and marketing are more critical than ever, he said.  “Health insurance needs to be sold. To walk away from selling it is a formula for increased costs,” Lee said.  In Washington state, lawmakers set aside an extra $1.5 million to help their marketplace cut through the confusion.  The state’s Healthplanfinder has added four enrollment centers — for a total of six — and is running digital and radio ads that promote the exchange as a beacon of stability amid the uncertainty in much of the rest of the nation.  Chief Marketing Officer Michael Marchand is grateful for Washington’s independence from the federally run marketplace. That is particularly true when it comes to so-called navigators, the specialists who fan out across the state to help consumers study various plans and enroll.  State-based exchanges in Washington and elsewhere are maintaining their funding levels at a time when the federal government has slashed navigator grants from $63 million to $36 million.  “They have to play by the house rules,” Marchand said of the states using the federal marketplace. “That’s a difficult thing.”",3.888888888888889,9,"[3.5, 4.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 1.5, 4.0, 5.0]"

The Federal Emergency Management Agency said Oct. 27, it had no involvement in the decision to award a $300 million contract to help restore Puerto Rico's power grid to a tiny Montana company in Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke’s hometown. FEMA said in a statement that any language in the controversial contract saying the agency approved of the deal with Whitefish Energy Holdings is inaccurate. (AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa, File)  SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — The head of Puerto Rico’s power company said Sunday the agency is cancelling its $300 million contract with Whitefish Energy Holdings amid scrutiny of the tiny Montana company’s role in restoring the island’s power system.  The announcement by Ricardo Ramos came hours after Gov. Ricardo Rossello urged the utility to scrap the deal for Whitefish’s help in rebuilding the electrical system from the damage inflicted by Hurricane Maria.  “It’s an enormous distraction,” Ramos said of the controversy over the contract. “This was negatively impacting the work we’re already doing.”  The current work by Whitefish teams will not be affected by the cancellation and that work will be completed in November, Ramos said. He said the cancellation will delay pending work by 10 to 12 weeks if no alternatives are found.  Ramos said he had not talked with Whitefish executives about his announcement. “A lawsuit could be forthcoming,” he warned.  Whitefish spokesman Chris Chiames told The Associated Press that the company was “very disappointed” in the governor’s decision, and said it would only delay efforts to restore power.  He said Whitefish brought 350 workers to Puerto Rico in less than a month and it expected to have a total of 500 this week. Chiames said the company completed critical work, including a project that will soon lead to a half million people in San Juan getting power.  “We will certainly finish any work that (the power company) wants us to complete and stand by our commitments,” he said.  Roughly 70 percent of the U.S. territory remains without power more than a month after Maria struck on Sept. 20 as a Category 4 storm with winds of up to 154 mph (245 kph). Ramos said Sunday that the total of cost of restoring the system would come to $1.2 billion.  The cancellation is not official until approved by the utility’s board. Ramos said it would take effect 30 days after that.  Ramos said the company already has paid Whitefish $10.9 million to bring its workers and heavy equipment to Puerto Rico and has a $9.8 million payment pending for work done so far.  Ramos said cancellation of the contract will not lead to a penalty, but it’s likely the government will pay at least $11 million for the company to go home early, including all costs incurred in the month after the cancellation.  Federal investigators have been looking into the contract awarded to the small company from Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke’s hometown and the deal is being audited at the local and federal level.  Ramos said the company contacted Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority two days before the storm hit, at a time when it was becoming clear the hurricane could cause massive damage.  Ramos earlier said he had spoken with at least five other companies that demanded rates similar to those of Whitefish, but also wanted a down payment the agency did not have.  He said Sunday he hadn’t consulted with anyone else about signing the deal and didn’t notify the governor’s office for a week. He again praised Whitefish’s work.  “They’re doing an excellent job,” he said.  “There’s nothing illegal here ... Of that, we’re sure,” he said, adding that he welcomes a federal investigation. “The process was done according to the law.”  Ramos said his agency at first believed the Federal Emergency Management Agency pre-approved contracts, something the agency has denied.  FEMA said it has not approved any reimbursement requests from the power company for money to cover repairs to the island’s electrical system. The contract said the utility would not pay costs unallowable under FEMA grants, but it also said, “The federal government is not a party to this contract.”  FEMA has raised concerns about how Whitefish got the deal and whether the contracted prices were reasonable. The 2-year-old company had just two full-time employees when the storm hit, but it has since hired more than 300 workers.  The White House had no comment Sunday. Last week, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the federal government had no role in the process that led to awarding the contract.  “This was something solely determined by the Puerto Rican government,” she said Friday.  Rossello said he has requested that crews from New York and Florida come help restore power in Puerto Rico as he criticized the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for not meeting its goals. The agency could not be immediately reached for comment.  The governor also announced the appointment of an outside coordinator to oversee the power company’s purchase and contracting division.  “If something illegal was done, once again, the officials involved in that process will feel the full weight of the law, and I will take administrative actions,” Rossello said.  A Whitefish contract obtained by The Associated Press found that the deal included $20,277 an hour for a heavy lift Chinook helicopter, $650 an hour for a large crane truck, $322 an hour for a foreman of a power line crew, $319 an hour for a journeyman lineman and $286 an hour for a mechanic. Each worker also gets a daily allowance of $80 for food, $332 for a hotel room and $1,000 for each flight to or from the mainland.  The company is based in Whitefish, Montana. Zinke, a former Montana congressman, knows Whitefish CEO Andy Techmanski, and Zinke’s son also had a summer job at a Whitefish construction site.  “I had absolutely nothing to do with Whitefish Energy receiving a contract in Puerto Rico,” Zinke recently said in a statement linked to a tweet. “Any attempts by the dishonest media or political operatives to tie me to awarding or influencing any contract involving Whitefish are completely baseless.”  Democrats also have questioned the role of HBC Investments, a key financial backer of Whitefish. The Dallas-based company’s founder and general partner, Joe Colonnetta, has contributed thousands of dollars to President Donald Trump and other Republicans. Chiames, the Whitefish spokesman, has said that Colonnetta’s political donations were “irrelevant” and that the company would cooperate with any federal authorities.  This week, Rep. Rob Bishop, the Utah Republican who heads the House Natural Resources Committee, sent the power company director a letter demanding documents, including those related to the contract with Whitefish and others that show what authority the agency has to deviate from normal contracting processes.  “Transparent accountability at (the power company) is necessary for an effective and sustained recovery in Puerto Rico,” his office said in a statement.  A federal control board that oversees Puerto Rico’s finances announced this week that retired Air Force Col. Noel Zamot will be in charge of power reconstruction efforts. Rossello and other officials have rejected the appointment, saying the local government is in charge of a power company that is $9 billion in debt and had struggled with outages before hurricanes Irma and Maria last month.",3.6818181818181817,110,"[3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 2.5, 1.5, 4.0, 3.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 5.0, 3.0, 3.5, 4.5, 2.0, 5.0, 5.0, 3.5, 5.0, 2.5, 3.5, 3.0, 2.0, 5.0, 0.5, 4.0, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.0, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 0.5, 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 3.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 1.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 2.5, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 3.0, 2.5, 4.0, 4.5, 2.5, 2.5, 2.0, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 2.5, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 2.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.0, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5, 2.5, 0.5, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 3.0, 3.5]"
1182,2779,10,30,2017,2017-10-30,Associated Press News,Some separatist-minded Catalans urge civil disobedience,"People wave ""estelada"" or pro independence flags outside the Palau Generalitat in Barcelona, Spain, after Catalonia's regional parliament passed a motion with which they say they are establishing an independent Catalan Republic, Friday, Oct. 27, 2017. (AP Photo/Emilio Morenatti)  BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — As the last customers finished their drinks at sidewalk cafes one warm October night, three silver-haired activists armed with a long-handled broom and a bucket quietly plastered posters on a nearby wall: “Hola nou pais” — “Hello new country.”  That birth was exactly what they and many others were celebrating in Catalonia, a prosperous northeastern region whose lawmakers voted in favor of independence from Spain on Friday. The Spanish government was aghast, quickly triggering unprecedented constitutional measures to fire the regional government and take direct control of many of Catalonia’s affairs in order to thwart secession.  Some separatist-minded Catalans have vowed to carry out a wave of civil disobedience in response to the application of Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution, saying they refuse to recognize Madrid’s authority. A few days before the vote, Catalonia’s now-sacked foreign affairs minister, Raul Romeva, said he believed the region’s civil servants — who number about 200,000 — would continue following orders from “the elected and legitimate institutions” rather than from Madrid.  But secession is not a simple process. A highly disputed referendum Oct. 1 was declared illegal by Spain’s constitutional court and boycotted by Catalans who want to stay a part of Spain. It also was marred by violence when national police clashed with people determined to vote.  The desire for independence is far from unanimous in Catalonia, which saw hundreds of thousands fill the streets Sunday in favor of remaining in Spain.  Exactly how Madrid imposes its authority on the region, and how independence-minded Catalan leaders and their supporters react, will be critical to how the drama plays out.  Since democracy was restored in Spain after dictator Gen. Francisco Franco’s death in 1975, Catalonia has run its own local institutions, including public media, schools, police, firefighters and health facilities.  Among the first to hint that Madrid’s takeover wouldn’t go smoothly were Barcelona’s firefighters. Even before Article 155 was invoked, they issued a statement describing the central government’s threats to do so as “the most serious attack suffered by Catalonia since 1939,” the start of Franco’s dictatorship.  “We do not recognize any other authority than our President, our Government and our Parliament,” the statement said. “We will only obey the Catalan legality, which has all our legitimacy.”  What this might translate into, however, is unclear. It is hardly likely that firefighters would refuse to extinguish blazes because of a political disagreement over who runs the fire department.  Marc Ferrer, a 43-year-old firefighter and spokesman for the Fire Brigade for Independence platform, said resistance would take a more symbolic form, with local services playing a “cat-and-mouse” game with Madrid.  “Even they don’t know how to apply Article 155,” he said. He refused to say what plans were being made for disobedience, citing security reasons.  “We are not going to do anything, we have never done anything, that puts people at risk,” he stressed, adding that disobedience could mean refusing to display an official flag on the fire station or a Spanish insignia on fire trucks.  “The response from the Spanish state — the only thing they understand — is repression. For us, it’s passive resistance and disobedience,” Ferrer said. “Now we will have to obey the minister. We won’t do it, because we are convinced that our cause is just and noble.”  But it is unclear how many civil servants would be willing to participate in general insubordination, particularly if they risk being fired. One of the major civil servants’ unions, the CSIF, rejected Romeva’s call for civil disobedience as “irresponsible.”  The union “considers that the vast majority of public employees in Catalonia will be on the side of the law,” it said in a statement.  One key area is whether Madrid takes direct control of Catalonia’s public media, as it has threatened.  “It’s difficult to say what will happen, because we are regulated by parliamentary law,” said Monica Terribas, a prominent Radio Catalan journalist and news presenter, noting that local media were producing balanced reporting on all issues.  “The public media in Catalonia are very professional,” she said. “If they want to intervene in the editorial programs, the professionals will not allow that.”  Catalonia’s three main public media outlets — TV3, Catalunya Radio and the ACN news agency — described Madrid’s threat as “a direct attack on the citizens of Catalonia and a denial of the right to true, objective, pluralistic, balanced information, a fundamental right in any democracy.”  Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has been at pains to point out he wasn’t seeking to abolish Catalonia’s self-governance, but rather to secure it by removing regional officials who had gone rogue and broken the law by declaring a new country. He has called a regional election for Dec. 21.  One of the most critical reactions could be from the region’s police force, the Mossos d’Esquadra, who had been seen by some as being too passive in not intervening to halt the Oct. 1 vote.  Spanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido sent an open letter Sunday to the police, calling for cooperation and unity.  “We are in a new era. And in this new scenario the Mossos d’Esquadra will once again be the police of all Catalans,” he wrote.  Initial indications pointed to a relatively smooth transition of power.  Valentin Anadon, spokesman for the main regional police union, FEPOL, which represents about 60 percent of the 17,000 members, was critical of Article 155 but said the police would always uphold the law.  Speaking before Madrid invoked the constitutional powers, Anadon hoped intervention into regional police would be “the least-invasive possible.”  But the idea that police might disobey orders wasn’t something he saw happening.  “The police are there to comply with the laws. Disobedience might be an option for a politician ... but this is something that the members of the police have no room for maneuver in,” he said.  “We are here to comply with the laws, period. The police of Catalonia must be the police of all Catalans,” Anadon said.  ___  Associated Press writer Aritz Parra contributed to this report.",3.6842105263157894,38,"[3.5, 1.0, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.0, 3.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 4.0, 3.5, 2.5, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.0, 5.0, 1.0, 2.5, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 2.5, 2.0, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0]"
1183,2780,10,29,2017,2017-10-29,Associated Press News,Why the explosive growth of e-commerce could mean more jobs,"Why the explosive growth of e-commerce could mean more jobs  In this Aug. 3, 2017, photo, workers prepare to move products at an Amazon fulfillment center in Baltimore. While jobs have been lost in brick-and-mortar stores, many more have been gained from e-commerce and warehousing. Amazon accounts for much of the additional employment. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)  WASHINGTON (AP) — When the robots came to online retailer Boxed, dread came, too: The familiar fear that the machines would take over, leaving a trail of unemployed humans in their wake.  “I had a lot of people asking me, ‘What is going to happen to us?’” says Veronica Mena, a trainer for the e-commerce startup, recalling the anxiety that rippled through her co-workers after company executives announced plans to open an automated warehouse in nearby Union, New Jersey.  Yet their fears didn’t come to pass.  When the new warehouse opened this spring, workers found that their jobs were less physically demanding than at the older, manual warehouse in Edison, New Jersey. Instead of walking thousands of steps a day loading items onto carts, employees could stand at stations as conveyor belts brought the goods to them.  And rather than cutting jobs, the company added a third shift to keep up with rapidly growing demand.  What happened at Boxed — and has occurred elsewhere — suggests that widespread fears about automation and job loss are often misplaced. Automation has actually helped create jobs in e-commerce, rather than eliminate them, and stands to create more in the years ahead. By accelerating delivery times, robotics and software have made online shopping an increasingly viable alternative to bricks-and-mortar stores, and sales have ballooned at online retailers.  The surge in e-commerce has required the rapid build-out of a vast network of warehouses and delivery systems that include both robots and human workers. The robots didn’t take jobs from people, because many of the jobs didn’t exist before.  “We’re not looking to do the same work with half the people,” said Rick Zumpano, vice president for distribution at Boxed. “Since we’re growing, we need everyone.”  Newer robotic technologies do loom as a threat to some e-commerce jobs. Startup robotics companies are developing robot arm prototypes, for example, that can pick goods from shelves. Those devices may replace some workers over the next decade.  But the explosion of e-commerce and the ease of automation are leading e-commerce companies to build more warehouses. So even if each warehouse employs fewer workers, the proliferation of new warehouses is projected to generate hiring across the industry.  In the meantime, jobs have been lost at storefront retailers, which have suffered under the e-commerce onslaught. Venerable chains such as Toys “R″ Us, RadioShack, and Payless Shoesource have all filed for bankruptcy this year.  There are widespread fears that things will get only worse for the nation’s 16 million retail workers. Self-checkout kiosks and experimental stores like Amazon’s Go , which has no cashiers, could theoretically eliminate millions of retail jobs.  But worries about a “retail apocalypse” have missed a more important trend: E-commerce actually leads to more jobs by paying people to do things we used to do ourselves.  When people shop online, tasks that once filled their days — driving to a store, searching through aisles for a product, bringing it to a cashier and paying for it — are now done by warehouse employees and truck drivers. People spend less time shopping than in the past, research shows.  Joe Song, an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch who has studied government data, has found that working women are spending less time shopping — nearly 25 hours less per year compared with a decade earlier. Song attributes the time savings mainly to e-commerce. Families increasingly outsource shopping to e-commerce employees, just as many have long outsourced other household tasks to child care workers or house cleaners. In each case, jobs are created.  That means the bankruptcies and store closings in the retail sector aren’t the complete picture. While jobs have been lost in stores, many more have been gained from online shopping. Michael Mandel, an economist at the Progressive Policy Institute, calculates that the number of e-commerce and warehousing jobs has leapt by 400,000 in the past decade, easily offsetting the loss of 140,000 brick-and-mortar retail jobs.  Amazon accounts for much of the additional employment. Yet it’s also at the vanguard of automation. Since 2014, Amazon has deployed 100,000 robots in 25 warehouses worldwide. At the same time, it’s nearly tripled its hourly workforce, from roughly 45,000 to nearly 125,000.  Its use of robotics has shaved the operating costs for a warehouse by about 20 percent, according to a report by Deutsche Bank. Such savings, in turn, have lowered the cost for Amazon to open new facilities — and hire more workers.  Mandel points out that it’s a lot like what happened more than a 100 years ago, when Henry Ford’s installation of assembly lines — an early form of automation — helped reduce the price of cars, which boosted demand so much that Ford needed more workers.  Robots have displaced many manufacturing workers in the past two to three decades, enabling factories to produce more with fewer employees.  Yet e-commerce and warehousing are growing far faster than manufacturing is — a crucial difference that lessens the impact of automation. E-commerce sales are surging roughly five times as fast as storefront retail sales, according to market research firm Forrester. By 2022, they’re expected to account for 17 percent of all retail sales, up from 13 percent this year.  From a handful of distribution centers in 2000, Amazon now has more than 240 warehouses and smaller delivery facilities, according to MWPVL, a consulting firm. Those warehouses have created tens of thousands of jobs and boosted wages in some communities, which many local employers call “the Amazon effect.”  But Amazon is not the only company that has experienced growth due to e-commerce.  Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, recently opened its sixth e-commerce campus near Orlando, Florida. Like the others, it includes a million square foot warehouse.  Walmart is also expanding its online grocery pickup service to 2,000 stores, double the 1,000 where it is now available. It allows Walmart’s customers to order groceries online, but requires more workers, not fewer. Ravi Jariwala, a spokesman, says Walmart has created a new job classification — “personal shopper” — to do what customers once did themselves: Pick and package orders.  And XPO Logistics, which ships mostly appliances and other heavy goods, has hired 3,000 warehouse workers in the past year to keep up with growing e-commerce, bringing its total to 26,000. It’s adding a million square feet of warehouse about every four to six weeks, says Ashfaque Chowdhury, president of XPO’s supply chain in the Americas and Asia.  Chowdhury says items that many people wouldn’t have felt comfortable buying on the internet not long ago — from refrigerators to treadmills to furniture — are becoming routine online purchases. And the company is also planning to open a million square foot warehouse in the Midwest exclusively to handle returns.  All these trends have been helped by automation’s ability to hold down costs, such as Walmart’s use of drones to help track its warehouse inventory.  Still, a tour of Boxed’s gleaming new warehouse in Union makes it easy to see why people worry that automation costs jobs. Everywhere you look you see machines and rows of neatly organized pallets of goods.  But not so many workers. Through the 140,000-square-foot building, two miles of conveyor belts quietly whisk plastic bins containing customers’ orders. One machine stamps mailing labels on boxes. Spread thinly along the conveyor belts, roughly three dozen workers operate on the floor.  Among the first stops on the conveyor is a four-story-high robotic contraption known as “Perfect Pick.” It enables one employee filling orders to choose from 700 items. An automated container, the iBOT, zips up and down and back and forth among the Perfect Pick’s shelves, where products are stored.  The iBOT retrieves small items — health and beauty products and snack foods — and brings them to the employee, who places them in bins.  At Amazon’s much larger warehouse in Baltimore, there are more workers, but also a lot more robots. They lift shelves of goods and roll them to the company’s pickers, who select items that customers have ordered before the robots return the shelves to storage.  Even so, there are still jobs at both warehouses for people to do. At Boxed, the bins glide from the Perfect Pick to other employees, who select additional items to complete an order. A separate group, the packers, puts everything in pastel-hued boxes for shipment. Fitting multiple items of different shapes and textures into a box is something people still do much better than robots.  Barbara Ward, 56, is a packer at Boxed, and like all her colleagues, she writes a thank-you note for each order she packages. It’s part of Boxed’s effort to preserve some aspects of the conventional shopping experience. When a customer has ordered diapers, a packer might write a congratulatory note.  At Amazon’s Baltimore warehouse, employees called “stowers” are needed to stock the shelves that are carried by robots. And that requires human judgment: Software suggests to workers where each item should be placed. But it’s an employee’s responsibility to make sure the shelves, which are tall and narrow, remain balanced.  There are also “problem solvers” who position themselves near a scale on a conveyor belt that weighs each package as it whizzes by. If the weight isn’t consistent with what’s supposed to be in the box, the package is set aside for a problem solver, who opens the box to see whether the order was filled correctly.  The warehouse covers the equivalent of 17 football fields and was opened in 2015, one of the first to be designed with robots in mind. Still, it employs 5,000 people.  Amazon and Boxed say their automated warehouses actually employ more workers than their non-automated warehouses do, because they handle far more volume.  And many employees say all the technology and machinery has made their jobs better.  Mena, 34, vastly prefers Boxed’s new facility to the manual warehouses where she previously worked. At one warehouse, owned by a medical equipment manufacturer, Mena says she would walk 15,000 steps a day to fill orders, according to her Fitbit. That’s about 7.5 miles.  “There’s less lifting to do,” she adds, now that goods are moved by conveyor belt rather than carts. “There are a lot of little things that make the job better.”  And with Boxed growing rapidly, she was promoted to trainer less than a year after starting as a temporary employee picking orders.  Ward, meanwhile, says she expects to be able to work longer at Boxed because her job is less physically demanding, thanks to automation.  Jobs are growing off the warehouse floor, as well. The explosion of online commerce is also building demand for higher-paying jobs in software and robotics. Nearly 14 percent of software job listings are now posted by retailers, according to data analyzed by Glassdoor, the job recruitment website. That share has doubled from 2012, says Andrew Chamberlain, Glassdoor’s chief economist.  And the software jobs are not as concentrated in places like Silicon Valley. Dallas, for example, has experienced a surge in software jobs, partly because of greater hiring by Home Depot.  “That’s a huge change,” Chamberlain said. “Software-related jobs are a bellwether of automation.”  Amazon’s career website lists nearly 5,000 open software jobs and 250 in machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence. Walmart is advertising 475 software and technology jobs, including data analysts, programmers, and software engineers.  These aren’t folks who just maintain websites.  When a customer shops on Boxed’s website, software calculates what size box will be needed and how much empty space it will contain, Zumpano said. Just before checkout, the website will recommend products that would fill the box’s empty space, yet not so many that the order would require another box.  Automation and robotics will only get more sophisticated in the future, which will threaten some jobs.  Amazon runs an annual “picking” contest in which mostly startup firms and universities compete to see which team’s robot can most efficiently pick items from a shelf and place them in a box.  “What’s going to happen next is robotic arms, combined with vision technology and suction technology,” says Marc Wulfraat, president of MWVPL, a consulting firm. “You can be darn sure that Amazon will take the first swing at it.”  But it could take several years for such robots to be put into widespread use. For now, they work mostly with items in boxes and other rigid shapes, Wulfraat says. They can’t yet handle bulkier items such as basketballs or softer items like clothes.  “Robotic hand technology is still pretty far off,” Boxed’s CEO, Chieh Huang, says. The company recently installed robots in its three other manual warehouses to transport goods to workers, as an alternative to conveyor belts. They didn’t lay off any employees.  And Mandel argues that if additional automation, such as robotic pickers, lowers costs further, it could create new markets for products and services, such as custom-made goods.  Wulfraat predicts that hundreds of smaller warehouses will be built in large cities to shorten delivery times to as low as an hour, particularly for groceries. Amazon already has 53 such facilities, and its competitors will be forced to follow suit.  “You’re going to need distribution facilities in the backyard of every city,” Wulfraat says. Those facilities will be smaller and cheaper and won’t be worth fully automating.  Automation is also more likely in the coming years to make up for labor shortages rather than replace workers, Wulfraat says.

1214,2812,10,31,2017,2017-10-31,Associated Press News,Ex-Trump adviser’s guilty plea poised to rattle White House," In this Aug. 25, 2016, file photo, Sam Clovis speaks during a news conference as then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, left, watches before a campaign rally in Dubuque, Iowa. George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign aide belittled by the White House as a low-level volunteer was thrust on Oct. 30, 2017, into the center of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign. Papadopoulos communicated most with then-Trump campaign adviser Clovis and campaign chairman Paul Manafort according to an official with the foreign policy advisory council. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)  WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump dismissed George Papadopoulos on Tuesday as a “liar” and a mere campaign volunteer, but newly unsealed court papers outline the former adviser’s frequent contacts with senior officials and with foreign nationals who promised access to the highest levels of the Russian government.  They also hint at more headaches for the White House and former campaign officials. Papadopoulos, now cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller as he investigates possible coordination between Russia and Trump’s 2016 White House campaign, is poised to dish.  Records made public Monday in Papadopoulos’ case list a gaggle of people who were in touch with him during the campaign but only with such identifiers as “Campaign Supervisor,” ″Senior Policy Advisor” and “High-Ranking Campaign Official.” Two of the unnamed campaign officials referenced are in fact former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his business associate Rick Gates, both. charged with financial crimes in an indictment unsealed Monday.  The conversations described in charging documents cut to the heart of Mueller’s investigation, reflecting Papadopoulos’ efforts to arrange meetings between Trump aides and Russian government intermediaries and revealing how he learned the Russians had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton in the form of “thousands of emails.”  White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders says Donald Trump campaign staffer George Papadopoulos' guilty plea is an example of a person who ""did the wrong thing"" while ""the president's campaign did the right thing. (Oct. 31)  Though the contacts may not by themselves have been illegal, the oblique but telling references to unnamed people — including “Professor” and “Female Russian National” — make clear that Mueller’s team has identified multiple people who had knowledge of back-and-forth outreach efforts between Russians and associates of the Trump election effort.  It’s a reality that challenges the administration’s portrait of Papadopoulos as a back-bench operator within the campaign, an argument repeated Tuesday by White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who dismissed him as a “volunteer” with a minimal role.  In charging the 30-year-old Papadopoulos with lying to the FBI, Mueller’s team is warning of a similar fate for anyone whose statements deviate from the facts.  “I think everyone to whom Mueller and his team wanted to send a message heard loud and clear the message,” said Jacob Frenkel, a Washington defense lawyer.  The White House had braced over the weekend for an indictment of Manafort and for allegations of financial misconduct that it could dismiss as unrelated to the campaign or administration. Then came the unsealing of Papadopoulos’ guilty plea and an accompanying statement of facts that detailed his desire to set up a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, and his cooperation with prosecutors since his arrest at an airport last summer.  The extent of the contacts is substantial. During a six-month period ending Aug. 15, Papadopoulos met, telephoned, Skyped or emailed his three foreign contacts or five different Trump campaign officials a total of 29 times. He also traveled twice to London and once to Italy. Another trip to Moscow was canceled.  There are clear indications that prosecutors probing possible criminal activity have leaned on Papadopoulos to gather more information about the campaign as they probe possible criminal activity.  He was arrested in July, but the case was not unsealed until Monday, giving prosecutors weeks to debrief him for information. He was initially arrested on false statements and obstruction of justice allegations, but pleaded guilty only to lying to the FBI, a possible token of leniency for further cooperation.  In court papers, prosecutors have said prematurely making the case public would restrict his ability to be a “proactive cooperator,” which legal experts say could including surreptitious techniques like wearing a microphone to record conversations.  “I would infer from that that he was working proactively on behalf of the prosecutors, which would mean going out and obtaining evidence,” said former Justice Department prosecutor Peter Zeidenberg.  Though the campaign officials and other people referenced in the complaint are not named, it’s nonetheless possible to ferret out the identities of several.  For instance, Joseph Mifsud is the “London professor” who figures prominently in the case as a would-be link between the Trump campaign and Russia, according to a comparison of court papers and emails obtained by The Associated Press. Mifsud confirmed to The Telegraph newspaper that he is the professor.  In court papers, Mifsud is described as having met repeatedly with Papadopoulos and having offered to set up meetings with Russian officials who could provide “thousands of emails” with damaging information about Clinton.  Papadopoulos told the FBI he did not tell anyone in the campaign about the “dirt” because he thought the foreign contact might be a “nothing.”  The professor is also credited in the document with introducing Papadopoulos to a woman referred to as a “female Russian national” who served as a potential link to the Russian government. Papadopoulos described her incorrectly in emails to Trump campaign officials as Putin’s niece. She has not yet been identified publicly.  Mifsud, a vocal Putin backer, told the newspaper the FBI case lacks credibility and that he did not tell anyone he could produce emails that would weaken the Clinton campaign.  Papadopoulos’ place on the Trump campaign was formalized in March when Trump adviser Sam Clovis released the names of eight foreign policy advisers amid public pressure on Trump to disclose his foreign policy team.  A lawyer representing Clovis confirmed in a statement that he was the person, identified as the “Campaign Supervisor” in court papers, who brought Papadopoulos onto the advisory committee. In court papers, the unnamed supervisor receives some of Papadopoulos’ email exchanges about his attempts to line up a meeting with the Russians, appearing to encourage the effort at one point by responding “Great work.” He also later encouraged Papadopoulos to travel to Russia on his own.  The lawyer’s statement said Clovis opposed any trip to Russia for Trump or his campaign staff but noted that Clovis may not have made his opposition known when “a volunteer made suggestions on a foreign policy matter.”  The foreign policy advisory council on which Papadopoulos sat met on a monthly basis throughout the spring and summer for a total of about six times, according to an official involved with the group. Papadopoulos, who was based in London at the time, did not attend all of the meetings, but he did attend a dinner meeting of the advisers in late June at the Capitol Hill Club in Washington with Attorney General Jeff Sessions.  Trump released a photo of the meeting on social media.  Papadopoulos, who had no formal responsibilities, communicated most with Clovis and Manafort, according to an official involved with the group who was unauthorized to disclose internal campaign activities. Papadopoulos angered some on the foreign policy team in early May by urging former British Prime Minister David Cameron to apologize after calling Trump “divisive, stupid and wrong.”  ___  Associated Press writers Steve Peoples in Washington and Greg Katz in London contributed to this report.",3.076923076923077,13,"[4.0, 0.5, 4.0, 2.5, 5.0, 3.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 0.5, 3.0, 4.5]"

Chuck Schumer of N.Y., center, speaks to reporters following the weekly Democratic policy luncheon on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Oct. 31, 2017. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell exhibited no interest Tuesday in considering legislation shielding the special counsel from Donald Trump, even as Republicans warn the president against interfering with Robert Mueller’s investigation.  McConnell’s remarks came as Trump has continued using Twitter to complain about the continued focus on “phony Trump/Russia” connections, instead of on Hillary Clinton and Democrats. They also came a day after Mueller’s inquiry into Russian meddling during the 2016 presidential race yielded a guilty plea and two indictments of Trump campaign officials.  Two bipartisan bills were introduced months ago that would make it harder for a special counsel to be fired. After an initial flurry of support, the bills have stalled as Trump has softened his public criticism of Mueller.  “We’ve got plenty of things we have to do between now and the end of the year that will take up floor time,” McConnell, R-Ky., said Tuesday when asked if he’d bring the measures to the Senate floor if Trump impedes Mueller’s work.  At one point, Trump’s legal team looked into potential conflicts surrounding the team Mueller has hired, including the backgrounds of members and political contributions by some members of his team to Clinton.  McConnell, who has expressed confidence in Mueller’s work, said the Senate’s role in the investigation is being performed by the chamber’s Intelligence committee.  “That’s our role in it, and special counsel has his job to do, and we’re going to concentrate on what we’re doing here,” said McConnell.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a brief interview that he’d not asked McConnell to bring the bills protecting Mueller to the Senate floor, saying, “We’ll see what happens.” On Monday, Schumer called for swift congressional action should Trump interfere with the investigation.  Legislation sponsored by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., would prevent the firing of any special counsel unless the dismissal was first reviewed by a panel of three federal judges. Legislation co-sponsored by Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., would let any Justice Department special counsel challenge their removal in court.  The Senate GOP’s No. 2 leader complimented the guilty plea by George Papadopoulos for lying to FBI agents about Russian contacts.  “I think hopefully it will send a message to everybody else to cooperate with the investigation and to answer the FBI’s questions and not to lie,” said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. “So I thought that was a very positive move from that standpoint.”  Other Republicans made clear their opposition to any presidential interference in Mueller’s work, including Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., another GOP leader. Blunt said he wasn’t concerned that Trump might take on Mueller more aggressively but added, “I’m also not for it.” He said firing Mueller “would be a big mistake.”  “Everybody that I know does not think that’s a good idea,” Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who’s clashed with Trump, said of a Mueller firing. “I don’t know what the actual reaction would be if it happened. I doubt if it’s going to, but I’ve been wrong almost every time.”  Jay Sekulow, Trump’s personal lawyer, shot down the possibilities of firing Mueller and or the president pardoning people caught up in the probe.  “The president has not indicated to me or to anyone else that I work with that he has any intent on terminating Robert Mueller,” Sekulow said in an interview Tuesday with ABC’s “Good Morning America.”  On pardons, he said: “I have not had a conversation with the president regarding pardons. And pardons are not on the table.”  Besides Papadopoulos’ guilty plea, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates have both pleaded not guilty to conspiracy and money laundering charges.  White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters after the charges were released that “there is no intention or plan to make any changes in regards to the special counsel.”  Lawmakers have been on guard since May, when Trump abruptly fired FBI Director James Comey and Mueller was appointed.  ___  AP reporter Matthew Daly contributed.",3.3461538461538463,26,"[4.5, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 0.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 5.0, 2.5, 4.0, 0.5, 4.0, 3.5, 1.5, 0.5, 2.5, 5.0]"

Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign aide belittled by the White House as a low-level volunteer was thrust on Oct. 30, 2017, to the center of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, providing evidence in the first criminal case that connects Trump’s team and intermediaries for Russia seeking to interfere in the campaign. (Donald Trump's Twitter account via AP)  WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Tuesday that a former campaign aide thrust into the center of special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe “has already proven to be a liar.”  On Twitter, Trump sought to dismiss George Papadopoulos, who has provided key evidence in the first criminal case connecting Trump’s team to alleged intermediaries for Russia’s government.  Said Trump: “Few people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar. Check the DEMS!”  Papadopoulos was approached by people claiming ties to Russia and offering “dirt” on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of emails, according to court documents unsealed Monday. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about the conversations and has been cooperating with investigators, the documents said.  Papadopoulos’ guilty plea and the possibility that he’s working with Mueller’s team came as an unexpected twist in the mounting drama surrounding the criminal probe. A separate welter of charges Mueller announced Monday against Trump’s ex-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his longtime aide Rick Gates do not appear directly related to their work for Trump.  But Papadopoulos’ case cuts close to the central question of Mueller’s investigation: Did Russia try to sway the election? Did Trump’s campaign know?  “The Russians had emails of Clinton,” Papadopoulos was told by a professor with ties to Russia during a breakfast meeting at a London hotel in April. U.S. investigators said that the following day, Papadopoulos then emailed a Trump campaign policy adviser, “Have some interesting messages coming in from Moscow about a trip when the time is right.”  The court papers do not name the professor. But a comparison of conversations cited in the court papers and emails previously obtained by The Associated Press show the professor is Joseph Mifsud, honorary director of the London Academy of Diplomacy. Mifsud did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Papadopoulos was arrested in July and has been interviewed repeatedly by authorities, the filing said. After entering his guilty plea he was ordered not to contact other Trump officials and prohibited from foreign travel. In one of the unsealed files, an FBI agent working for Mueller bluntly hinted that more former Trump associates could soon be questioned.  Papadopoulos’ lawyer, Thomas M. Breen, based in Chicago, declined to comment on the guilty plea but noted that “we will have the opportunity to comment on George’s involvement when called upon by the court at a later date. We look forward to telling all of the details of George’s story at that time.”  The incident echoes elements of a June 2016 meeting involving Donald Trump Jr. and other campaign officials at Trump Tower. The president’s son organized that sit down with a Russian lawyer who was offering negative information about Clinton.  The White House immediately cast Papadopoulos as a mere volunteer with little influence during last year’s campaign. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said his role was “extremely limited” and that “no activity was ever done in an official capacity on behalf of the campaign.”  Trump named Papadopoulos to his foreign policy advisory council in March 2016, among a short list of experts amid growing public pressure on Trump to demonstrate he had a bench of foreign policy expertise.  During a March 21, 2016 meeting with The Washington Post editorial board, Trump called Papadopoulos an “excellent guy.”  Shortly afterward, Trump tweeted a photo of his advisory council meeting, with Papadopoulos among a handful of advisers at the president’s table. In his plea filing, Papadopolous admitted that he told Trump and other top campaign national security officials during that meeting that he had made contact with intermediaries for Russia who said they could set up a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.  The court filings recount Papadopoulos’ meetings abroad starting in March 2016, after he’d been named to Trump’s board. Papadopoulos initially told the investigators the meetings came before, and later admitted that was untrue. Papadopoulos also deleted a Facebook post about his travels, the documents said.  The court filings say he met first with the professor who boasted of damaging emails and then later with an unnamed Russian woman, who claimed to be related to Putin and sought to arrange a meeting between Trump and the Russian leader. The professor also introduced Papadopoulos to a third unnamed person who claimed he had connections to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The two men then exchanged emails about a possible meeting between Trump campaign aides and Russian government officials.  The third man is Ivan Timofeev, according to the emails obtained by the AP. Timofeev is director of programs at a Moscow think tank, the Russian International Affairs Council. In a statement posted in August on the council’s website, Timofeev acknowledged his 2016 contacts with Papadopolous, saying his group “requested an official inquiry concerning Mr. Trump or his team members’ possible visit.” He said the council regularly hosts officials from the U.S. and that the Trump campaign “initiative was a matter of routine” for the council.  The court records didn’t specify which emails the Russian claimed to have.  The timing of the new disclosures about Clinton emails may be significant because the scope of the Kremlin’s efforts to hack Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee were just beginning to be understood by March 2016, weeks before Papadopoulos was told of damaging emails.  It’s unclear how frequently Papadopoulos was in contact with the campaign officials. Sanders initially said the foreign policy advisory board convened only once, but the White House later clarified she was speaking only of official meetings with Trump in attendance. An official involved with the group said the group met on a monthly basis throughout the spring and summer for a total of about six meetings.  ___  Associated Press writers Tom LoBianco and Chad Day in Washington and Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow contributed to this report.",3.7857142857142856,7,"[3.0, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.0]"

Downey's severely decomposed body was found in February of 1984 but wasn't identified until this spring when the FBI began using new fingerprint technology to resolve identity cases dating back to the 1970s. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)  DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Just after Thanksgiving Day in 1983, James Downey dropped off his older brother, John, at a Houston bus station, then quickly turned away so neither the police nor a motorcycle gang affiliated with his brother could later demand details about where the bus was headed.  For 34 years, he didn’t hear a word about him. Then this spring Downey received a heart-breaking call, one that more than 200 families across the country have gotten in the last few months since the FBI began using new fingerprint technology to resolve identity cases dating back to the 1970s.  Authorities reported that the remains of a man found beaten to death decades ago along a brushy path in Des Moines, 800 miles away, had been identified as his brother.  “We always figured something had happened to him,” James Downey said from his home in Houston. “We all assumed he’d got killed somewhere or died in an accident.”  Since launching the new effort in February, the FBI and local medical examiner offices have identified 204 bodies found between 1975 and the late 1990s. The cases stretch across the country, with the largest number in Arizona, California, New York, Florida and Texas.  Using a new computer algorithm, an FBI unit has taken another look at fingerprints from about 1,500 bodies found years or even decades ago and succeeded in making more than 200 matches to prints previously on record. (Oct. 31)  “We didn’t know the actual potential success. We were hoping to identify a few cases, maybe five or 10,” said Bryan Johnson, a manager in the FBI’s Latent Fingerprint Support Unit who proposed the effort. “We’re really proud that we found another way of doing this.”  Under the new program, Johnson and eight others in the FBI unit ran fingerprints from about 1,500 bodies through a new computer algorithm that could make matches from low-quality prints or even a single finger or thumb. Previously, the standard algorithm typically needed quality prints from all 10 fingers to make a match.  The unit is now urging local authorities to search through other old case files and send in smudged or partial prints that couldn’t previously be matched.  The FBI’s newfound ability was key to the Des Moines case because by the time Downey’s body was found in February 1984, it had been buried under snow and dirt for months and was severely decomposed. Authorities sought the public’s help in identifying the body, including publishing drawings of distinctive tattoos in the local newspaper, but no one came forward.  “We know he was murdered and dumped in this area but Des Moines police never really developed any leads on it and basically forgot about the case,” county Medical Examiner Greg Schmunk said.  It was one of several cases that medical examiner investigators called “shelf dwellers,” referring to cremated remains that would sit for decades on storage shelves.  But the fact that this was a homicide and the unusual tattoos — including a skeleton clad in Nazi garb and a cartoon figure wearing a hat and smoking a cigarette — prompted investigators to rummage through police archives and resubmit the single available thumbprint into the Missing and Unidentified Persons System, called NamUs.  They were shocked months later when the FBI’s Johnson called to confirm they had matched the thumbprint to prints of Downey taken after an earlier arrest in Texas.  About 40 percent of the identifications through the FBI’s new process have been cases in Arizona. Most are people who died while attempting to make the dangerous desert crossing from Mexico.  Bruce Anderson, the forensic anthropologist for Pima County, Arizona, keeps more than 1,000 unidentified person charts filed along his office wall.  “If you can remove one of these charts, have one family reach out to you to confirm an identity, some of that weight on us is removed,” Anderson said.  In nearby Yuma County, Arizona, the FBI fingerprint initiative enabled authorities to finally identify a young woman whose body was found in 1999 near the Colorado River, where she was killed with a shotgun blast to her face.  For Sgt. Ryland Croutch, the identification of the victim as 18-year-old Angel McAllister, through a match with an earlier smudged print, was a relief. He’d been assigned to the killing only a few years after starting his job with the Yuma County sheriff’s office, and as the years passed had promised himself that he’d discover her identity before retiring.  “She was such a pretty young girl,” said Crouch, now 58. “And it sounds like she was smart, but she had some demons, people she liked to hang out with who were dangerous.” He said he’s hopeful that investigators now can find leads to her killer.  Aden Naka, assistant director for forensics investigation in New York City, said many of the new identifications there were of bodies found in water, with some dating back to the early 1990s. Once they had a match, Naka said, staffers tried to find relatives or aid a criminal investigation if one is open.  “This matters tremendously,” Naka said. “Everyone deserves a name.”  ___  Associated Press writer Margery A.

(AP Photo/Muhammad Sajjad)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Global warming is hurting people’s health a bit more than previously thought, but there’s hope that the Earth — and populations — can heal if the planet kicks its coal habit, a group of doctors and other experts said.  The poor and elderly are most threatened by worsening climate change, but there remains “glimmers of progress” especially after the 2015 Paris agreement to limit heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions, according to a new big study published Monday in the British medical journal Lancet.  Comparing the report to a health checkup, four researchers and several outside experts described Earth’s prognosis as “guarded.”  “There are some very severe warning signs, but there are some hopeful indicators too,” said co-author Dr. Howard Frumkin, a professor of environmental health at the University of Washington. “Given the right treatment and aggressive efforts to prevent things from getting worse, I think there’s hope.”  The report highlighted health problems stemming from more frequent heat waves, disease spread by insects, air pollution and other woes. While the disasters have been costly, deaths haven’t been increasing because society is doing a better but more expensive job adjusting to the changing conditions, the researchers noted.  A team of 63 doctors, public health officials and scientists from around the world wrote what they considered the first of a regular monitoring of the health of the planet, similar to having a “finger on the pulse of the patient,” said Dr. Hugh Montgomery, an intensive care specialist and director of the University College of London’s Institute for Health and Performance.  Based on 40 indicators, the study said “the human symptoms of climate change are unequivocal and potentially irreversible.”  While other disease rates are dropping, cases of dengue fever — a mosquito-borne disease — has doubled every decade since 1990 with 58.4 million cases and 10,000 deaths in 2013. Frumkin, a former environmental health director at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said climate change, which allows mosquitoes to live in more places and stay active longer with shorter freeze seasons, is part but not all of the reason.  The same goes for the increase in tick-borne Lyme disease in the United States, Frumkin said, adding “the ticks do better with warmer weather.”  Between 2000 and last year, the number of vulnerable people — those over 65 or with chronic disease — exposed to heat waves increased by about 125 million, the study said.  It also highlighted the increasing likelihood of food shortages as climate change worsens.  Columbia University’s Madeline Thomson, who wasn’t part of the study team, praised the work, saying “climate is a stress multiplier” so it is important to monitor this way.  Acting on climate can have side benefits, Frumkin said. Cutting coal takes smog and soot out of the air, while eating less meat and bicycling and walking more to use less electricity means fewer accidents and reduced obesity, he said.  ___  Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears.

(AP Photo/Omar Akour)  SHARHABIL, Jordan (AP) — From a hillside in northern Jordan, the Yarmouk River is barely visible in the steep valley below, reduced from a once important water source to a sluggish trickle overgrown with vegetation. Jordan’s reservoirs are only one-fifth full, a record low, and vital winter rains are becoming more erratic.  Jordanians don’t need scientists to tell them that they live in one of the world’s driest countries in the center of the planet’s most water-poor region.  But recent studies suggest the kingdom, a Western ally and refugee host nation with a growing population, is being hit particularly hard by climate change, getting hotter and drier than previously anticipated. One forecast predicts as much as 30 percent less rain by 2100.  “We are really in trouble if we don’t take action in time,” said Ali Subah, a senior Water Ministry official.  But addressing the problem would require cross-border cooperation, a commodity as scarce as water in the Jordan River basin shared by Jordan, Israel, the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon.  Jordan’s flagship Red Sea desalination project, which includes a water trade with Israel, has faced repeated delays, most recently because of a diplomatic crisis that led to a scaling back of cross-border contacts since the summer.  A master plan by the regional advocacy group EcoPeace that seeks to transform the Jordan River valley into an economically vibrant green oasis by 2050 is based, in part, on a state of Palestine being established on Israeli-occupied lands. Palestinian independence remains distant, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently asserted that Israel will never leave the stretch of the Jordan Valley in the occupied West Bank.  Warning signs abound of what a failure to act looks like.  The Dead Sea and Jordan River, global treasures with religious significance as the cradle of Christianity, have been devastated by dropping water levels due to decades of water diversion to urban areas. Some experts suggest civil war in neighboring Syria, which led to a large influx of refugees to Jordan and other neighboring countries, may have been triggered in part and indirectly by a mismanaged drought.  Munqeth Mehyar, the president of EcoPeace, said the growing water scarcity urgently requires cooperation.  “People need to be aware of their water situation, and try to compromise between their water reality and their nationalistic politics,” he said at his group’s lush, formerly arid 270-hectare (675-acre) reserve in the Jordan Valley, a witness to nature’s power to bounce back.  Stanford University researchers say that in the absence of international climate policy action, the kingdom would have 30 percent less rainfall by 2100. Annual average temperatures would increase by 4.5 degrees Celsius (8.1 degrees Fahrenheit) and the number and duration of droughts would double, compared to the 1981-2010 period.  Water flows to Jordan from the Yarmouk River, which originates in Syria, would remain low due to droughts and diversion, regardless of when the civil war ends.  The results, published in the journal Science Advances and based on improved data analysis tools, suggest the impact of climate change is likely to be more severe than anticipated, said Steven Gorelick, head of the university’s internationally supported Jordan Water Project.  Another study found that man-made climate change was a major force behind an extreme drought in the area in early 2014, said co-author Rachael McDonnell of the International Center for Biosaline Agriculture in Dubai.  “The findings are more severe than anticipated and more imminent,” she said.  The World Bank named Jordan, Iraq, Lebanon, Morocco and Syria as the countries in the Middle East and North Africa that will experience significantly increased water stress driven by climate change. The bank’s report in August described the region as the “global hotspot of unsustainable water use.”  Israel is on the road to resolving its water scarcity, producing close to 75 percent of water for domestic use in desalination plants and recycling more than half of its waste water for agricultural use, said Yacov Tsur, a professor of environmental economics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.  Israel is being aided by technological advances, easy access to sea water and a strong economy that can afford large-scale projects, he said.  Jordan, which pulls 160 percent more water from the ground than nature puts in, views desalination as the main answer.  A Jordan-only option would be costly. Jordan’s main population center is about 300 kilometers (190 miles) from the only coastline, making it prohibitively expensive to deliver desalinated Red Sea water to the capital, Amman.  In recent years, a water trade plan was developed to get around high transport costs.  Jordan would desalinate Red Sea water, sell some to nearby southern Israel and pump the brine into the Dead Sea to raise water levels there. Separately, water from northern Israel would be sold to nearby northern Jordan and to Palestinian communities.  Israel has a strategic interest in the stability of security ally Jordan, a land buffer against the region’s turmoil.  But the Red Sea-Dead Sea project has hit snags, in part over funding, and Jordan still hasn’t approached five short-listed consortiums to submit their bids.  The ongoing diplomatic crisis, triggered by the fatal shooting of two Jordanians by an Israeli Embassy guard in Amman in July, also contributed to delays by reducing cross-border contacts, said Subah, the Water Ministry official.  He said Jordan remains committed to the regional project but will also look at fallback options. “The Jordanian solution for water in the future is desalination,” he said. “If it’s regional, if it’s on our own, we will go in this direction.”  Some say the government’s focus on desalination is linked, in part, to reluctance to implement politically painful conservation measures.  For example, more than 50 percent of Jordan’s water is used for agriculture which produces only a small share of the local food supply.  Water for irrigation remains heavily subsidized, encouraging waste and the planting of water-intensive crops such as bananas and tomatoes.  About half the water supply is lost from the network, most of it due to misuse or theft.  The government has cracked down on illegal water use, announced a slight price increase and plans to ramp up waste water treatment for use in agriculture as budgets permit.  But there are fears that draconian reforms could lead to instability, said Hussam Hussein, a water expert at the American University of Beirut.  “This would not be popular at all,” he said. “That’s why, from a political perspective, it’s easier for the government to increase the supply and maintain the status quo.”  At EcoPeace, Jordanian, Israeli and Palestinian activists try not to lose hope, despite what Israeli co-director Gidon Bromberg acknowledged to be “enormous” political obstacles.  The group is floating a new swap idea, in addition to the Red-Dead project, in which Jordan would sell solar energy to Israel and the Palestinian self-rule government in exchange for water.  Separately, the group’s master plan outlines 127 projects with an investment value of $4.6 billion to help rehabilitate the Jordan River and the Dead Sea and grow the Jordan Valley’s economy almost 20-fold by 2050. The group recently identified 13 projects as doable now.  In a setback, the diplomatic crisis derailed a conference on the water-energy swap idea and a trilateral official meeting on how to move forward with the 13 projects.  Bromberg remains optimistic.  He said progress will be made once all involved realize that failure to respond to the water and environmental crises poses a risk to their national security.  “Where national security interests are clarified, they trump,” he said.",3.1818181818181817,11,"[2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 0.5, 4.5, 4.0, 5.0, 0.5]"

(Julia Wang/Waymo via AP)  ATWATER, Calif. (AP) — Google’s self-driving car spin-off is accelerating efforts to convince the public that its technology is almost ready to safely transport people without any human assistance at all.  Waymo, hatched from a Google project started eight years ago, showed off its progress Monday during a rare peek at a closely guarded testing facility located 120 miles (193 kilometers) southeast of San Francisco. That’s where its robots complete their equivalent of driver’s education.  The tour included giving more than three dozen reporters rides in Chrysler Pacifica minivans traveling through faux neighborhoods and expressways that Waymo has built on a former Air Force base located in the Californian Central Valley city of Atwater.  The minivans smoothly cruised the roads — driver’s seat empty and passengers in the back — at speeds of up to 35 mph (56 kph). By contrast, the Waymo-powered minivans that have been driving volunteer riders in the Phoenix area still use safety drivers to take over control if something goes wrong.  But Waymo’s real goal is to get to the point where people in cars are nothing but passengers.  Waymo CEO John Krafcik told reporters that the company will be making some cars and freight trucks totally driverless fairly soon, though he didn’t provide a specific timetable. “We are really close,” he said. “We are going to do it when we feel like we are ready.”  Since Google began working on self-driving cars in 2009, dozens of established automakers such as General Motors and Ford Motors have entered the race, along with other big technology companies, including Apple and ride-hailing service Uber. The competition is so fierce and the stakes so high that Waymo is currently suing Uber , alleging that one of its former managers stole its trade secrets and took them with him when he joined Uber in 2016 as part of an elaborate scheme. The trial in that high-profile case is scheduled to begin in early December.  Waymo is hoping to infuse its technology into ride-hailing services such as its current partner, Lyft, and big-rig trucking companies. It also intends to license its automated system to automakers such as Fiat Chrysler Automobile, which is already using it in 100 Pacifica minivans.",3.4402985074626864,67,"[4.5, 2.5, 0.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.0, 2.5, 0.5, 3.5, 3.5, 0.5, 5.0, 1.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 1.5, 4.5, 4.0, 5.0, 4.5, 5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 2.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 1.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.0, 2.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 2.0, 1.5, 3.5, 3.0, 2.5, 2.5, 4.5, 3.0, 2.5, 0.5, 3.0, 1.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 3.0, 5.0, 2.5, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5]"

CENTRAL BANK WATCH: The Bank of England is set to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade on Thursday to help keep a lid on inflation. That could hurt the British economy while it is struggling with the uncertainties of Brexit. Meanwhile, investors expect President Donald Trump to announce his choice to next head the U.S. Federal Reserve within days, a decision that could have far-ranging effects on the markets. The Fed is due to start a two-day meeting on Tuesday. It’s expected to raise rates at its next meeting in December, which would be the third increase of the year.  BANK OF JAPAN: The Bank of Japan wrapped up a policy meeting Tuesday with no changes to its ultra-lax stimulus program. It slightly raised its forecast for growth in this fiscal year but cut its outlook for inflation to 0.8 percent from an earlier forecast of 1.1 percent, saying that while the economy is gaining momentum, growth is not yet pushing wages higher or boosting consumer demand enough to fuel inflation.  EARNINGS: This week will see more than 100 companies in the S&P 500 index report their earnings results for July through September. In Asia, Samsung Electronics Co. reported another record high in quarterly earnings on a breathtaking run for a company that is fighting to get its leader out of jail. The South Korean company’s July-September net income surged 150 percent to 11 trillion won ($9.8 billion), compared with 4.4 trillion won a year earlier.  CHINA MANUFACTURING: An official survey said Chinese manufacturing activity expanded in October at a slower pace than the previous month as output weakened. The purchasing managers’ index released Tuesday fell to 51.6 from 52.4 in September. The index is based on a 100-point index where 50 divides expansion from contraction.

The Bank of England seems set to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade on upcoming Thursday, attempting to tackle rising inflation, according to suggestions signalled by bank governor Mark Carney.(AP Photo/Frank Augstein, FILE)  LONDON (AP) — The Bank of England is on Thursday set to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade in order to keep a lid on inflation, a move that has the potential to hurt the British economy just as it struggles with the uncertainties of Brexit.  The central bank is expected to lift its main interest rate by a quarter percentage point from the record low of 0.25 percent, taking back the cut it made in the aftermath of last year’s Brexit vote to support the economy through the market turmoil of the time.  If it delivers the cut, as bank Governor Mark Carney has indicated, it would be its first hike since July 2007, when world credit markets started to freeze up in what would prove to be an early phase of the global financial crisis.  The main motivation behind an increase is to bring down inflation, which is running above the bank’s target of 2 percent by a full percentage point and making life more expensive for households. Any further rise from the current annual rate of 3 percent would require Carney to write to Treasury chief Philip Hammond explaining why inflation is running more than a percentage point above target and what he and his colleagues on the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee are planning to do about it.  The reason for the spike in inflation is simple: Brexit. The pound plunged following the vote in June last year to leave the European Union, and now trades about 15 percent lower against a range of currencies. That has caused a spike higher in the cost of imported goods, notably food and energy.  Under normal circumstances, that would be more than enough reason to raise the cost of borrowing; higher interest rates can push up a currency, thereby dampening inflation by lowering import costs, and can also help cool an overheating economy.  The dilemma for the Bank of England is that the British economy isn’t showing any signs of overheating. Though unemployment stands at its lowest level since the mid-1970s and the main stock market in October hit a record high, the British economy is growing by less than any of the Group of Seven industrialized nations.  “Higher rates will be an unhelpful influence at a time when the economy is still struggling,” said Samuel Tombs, chief U.K. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.  Though economic growth in the July-September period was slightly better than expected at a quarterly rate of 0.4 percent, the British economy has fared worse than the likes of Germany, Japan and the United States this year. Wages are also not rising as much as prices, meaning household finances are getting stretched, while credit growth has eased back over the summer. And inflation, in any case, is forecast to fall back next year as the lower pound’s influence drops out of the annual comparison.  The worry is that by raising interest rates now, the Bank of England could further hobble an economy that’s trying to steer the choppy waters of Brexit. Higher interest rates should in theory act as a dampener on household spending, even though the proportion of mortgage debt in Britain on flexible interest rates has fallen over the past few years, with more people opting for the security of fixed rates.  According to Oliver Harvey, a strategist at Deutsche Bank, a rate hike will have a direct financial impact on “a relatively smaller amount” of households than before the financial crisis. However, those that will be affected by a rate hike would suffer noticeably due to the fact that rates are so low — even the anticipated quarter point increase would mean a doubling in the interest rate.  Harvey also notes that many households are already burdened by weak income growth, low savings and high debt.  As such, the decision to raise interest rates is not expected to be unanimous, with some rate-setters opting for a cautious approach in light of all the concerns surrounding Brexit.  The country is due to leave the EU in March 2019, and there’s no clarity on what the post-Brexit relationship between Britain and the EU, its main export market, will look like. Businesses are fretting about the lack of certainty and have urged the British government to swiftly conclude a transition agreement with the EU that will see the economic relationship remain in place for at least two years after Brexit. Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein is one prominent business leader to have warned in recent days that his firm may relocate chunks of his business out of London to Germany’s financial center in Frankfurt.  As a result, few economists think the Bank of England will embark on a quick sequence of rate hikes. ING economist James Smith expects Thursday’s vote to be 7-2 in favor of an increase and says that anything less could expose divisions among the rate-setting panel that would rein in expectations of any further hikes next year.  “We expect the bank to continue talking up the possibility of further tightening this week, but with uncertainty elevated, demand sluggish and few signs of domestic inflation, we think the bank will tread carefully,” said Smith.",3.6313559322033897,118,"[4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.0, 4.5, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 5.0, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 2.5, 5.0, 4.0, 4.5, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 1.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 2.5, 5.0, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 2.5, 5.0, 3.5, 3.0, 2.5, 4.5, 1.5, 4.5, 3.0, 4.5, 4.0, 5.0, 1.5, 5.0, 1.5, 3.5, 2.5, 4.0, 5.0, 2.5, 4.0, 4.5, 0.5, 4.0, 0.5, 4.5, 2.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.0, 3.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.5, 2.5, 4.0, 2.5, 4.0, 4.0, 5.0, 4.5, 2.5, 4.0, 3.5, 0.5, 2.5, 5.0, 4.5, 5.0, 2.5, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 3.0, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0, 3.0, 5.0]"

The information comes one day after Manafort appeared in court on charges including money laundering and other financial crimes.  In a court filing, the office of special counsel Robert Mueller says the precise value of Manafort’s assets is hard to quantify.  They say in November 2016 and January 2017, he noted assets to be worth approximately $25 million, but he has provided significantly higher amounts at other times.  The prosecutors say Manafort’s business associate, Rick Gates, who was also charged Monday, has also stated conflicting amounts.  They say sentencing guideline ranges correspond to a possible punishment of 121 to 151 months of imprisonment for Gates, and 151 to 188 months for Manafort.  Both pleaded not guilty.  ___  6:10 p.m.  A leading Democrat on the Senate Agriculture Committee says a confirmation hearing for one of President Donald Trump’s nominees should be delayed in light of new twists in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.  The special counsel investigating possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign indicted Trump's former campaign chairman and a business associate and revealed how an adviser lied to the FBI about meetings with Russians. (Oct. 31)  Trump has nominated former campaign adviser Sam Clovis to serve as chief scientist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  Clovis had communicated with George Papadopoulos, who admitted to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians intermediaries last year.  Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan says she has concerns about Clovis’ qualifications to coordinate agricultural research, and his contact with Papadopoulos raises a whole separate set of questions.  Meghan Cline, a spokeswoman for Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts of Kansas, says the committee will announce a hearing date for Clovis soon.  __  3:45 p.m.  The White House is continuing to distance itself from the former campaign aide thrust into the center of special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe.  White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders says Tuesday that George Papadopoulos is an example of “somebody doing the wrong thing while the president’s campaign did the right thing.”  She said the campaign fully cooperated with investigators while “what Papadopoulos did was lie.”  Sanders also said Trump only met Papadopoulos once and said he played a “minimal role, if one at all.”  Papadopoulos has provided key evidence in the first criminal case connecting Trump’s team to alleged intermediaries for Russia’s government. Court documents unsealed Monday show he admitted to lying to the FBI about meetings with Russian intermediaries.  ___  11:35 a.m.  The Associated Press has confirmed the identities of two foreign nationals at the center of contacts between Russia and a former adviser to President Donald Trump’s campaign.  Emails obtained by the AP show that George Papadopoulos’ conversations, cited in court papers, were with Joseph Mifsud and Ivan Timofeev.  Mifsud is a professor and honorary director of the London Academy of Diplomacy. Ivan Timofeev is director of programs at the Russian International Affairs Council in Moscow.  Court papers filed by special counsel Robert Mueller did not name the men. They say a professor told Papadopoulos in April 2016 that the Russians had “dirt” on Democrat Hillary Clinton in the form of emails. They also say Papadopoulos had discussions with the other man, described as having connections to the Russian foreign ministry.  __  10:20 a.m.  President Donald Trump is tweeting that the “biggest story” out of the charges announced Monday in the Russia investigation is the resignation of Democratic lobbyist Tony Podesta from his eponymous firm.  Podesta, the elder brother of former Hillary Clinton aide John Podesta, announced that he would step aside from powerhouse Democratic firm ‘The Podesta Group’ after coming under investigation by Robert Mueller.  “The biggest story yesterday, the one that has the Dems in a dither, is Podesta running from his firm,” Trump wrote in a two-part tweet that contained grammatical errors. “What he know about Crooked Dems is....earth shattering,” he tweeted.  The president added, “He and his brother could Drain The Swamp, which would be yet another campaign promise fulfilled. Fake News weak!”  Court papers unsealed Monday revealed an indictment against Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and a guilty plea by another adviser, who admitted to lying to the FBI about meetings with Russian intermediaries.  ___  8:45 a.m.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov says he sees nothing wrong with a former campaign adviser to President Donald Trump reaching out to a Kremlin-linked think tank.  Court papers unsealed on Monday revealed that George Papadopoulos who worked on the Trump campaign had reached out to a Russian he believed to have links to the Russian foreign ministry to arrange a meeting between the Trump team and Russian officials.  The Russian International Relations Council has confirmed contact with Papadopoulos, but said a meeting never took place. The council insisted that it was an independent advisory body and that it hosts many politicians at various public meetings.  Asked about the man mentioned in the indictment, Lavrov told reporters on Tuesday that he “does not see anything illegal” in the interaction.  ___  8:30 a.m.  President Donald Trump says a campaign adviser who has admitted to lying to the FBI about meetings with Russian intermediaries was a “low level volunteer” who was “proven to be a liar.”  Trump on Twitter Tuesday sought to distance himself from George Papadopoulos: “Few people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar.”  Court documents say Papadopoulos was approached by people claiming ties to Russia and offering “dirt” on Hillary Clinton in the form of “thousands of emails.” Papadopoulos has pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about the conversations.  Court papers unsealed Monday also revealed an indictment against Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort.  Trump said the allegations happened “long before” he joined the campaign. But the indictment details allegations stretching from 2006 to 2017.  ___  7:30 a.m.  A personal lawyer for President Donald Trump says the president is not planning to fire Robert Mueller, the special counsel in the Russia probe. And, Jay Sekulow (SEHK’-yoo-loh) says, pardons for his former campaign aides facing federal charges “are not on the table.”  Sekulow’s comments to ABC’s “Good Morning America” come a day after a former Trump aide admitted lying to the FBI about meeting with Russian intermediaries and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort pleaded not guilty to money laundering and conspiracy charges.  Sekulow says: “The president has not indicated to me or to anyone else that I work with that he has any intent on terminating Robert Mueller.”  On pardons, Sekulow says: “I have not had a conversation with the president regarding pardons. And pardons are not on the table.”  ___  6:50 a.m.  The Kremlin says Russia is not implicated by the first criminal cases against associates of President Donald Trump.  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov says that “so far Russia doesn’t figure in any way in these charges which have been made” and that Russia hopes that they do not feed “hysteria.”  Peskov adds that accusations of Russian meddling in the election remain “unfounded,” and “we are observing (the situation) with interest.”  Peskov also says that connections between former Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos and a man he believed to have links to the Russian Foreign Ministry did not prove any complicity by the Russian government.  ___  3:10 a.m.  Special counsel Robert Mueller has sent a warning to individuals in President Donald Trump’s orbit: If they lie about contacts between the president’s campaign and Russians, they’ll end up on the wrong end of federal criminal charges.  With the disclosure of the first criminal cases in his investigation, Mueller also showed that he will not hesitate to bring charges against people close to the campaign even if they don’t specifically pertain to Russian election interference and possible collusion with the Trump campaign.

Papadopoulos communicated most with then-Trump campaign adviser Clovis and campaign chairman Paul Manafort according to an official with the foreign policy advisory council. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)  WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump dismissed George Papadopoulos on Tuesday as a “liar” and a mere campaign volunteer, but newly unsealed court papers outline the former adviser’s frequent contacts with senior officials and with foreign nationals who promised access to the highest levels of the Russian government.  They also hint at more headaches for the White House and former campaign officials. Papadopoulos, now cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller as he investigates possible coordination between Russia and Trump’s 2016 White House campaign, is poised to dish.  Records made public Monday in Papadopoulos’ case list a gaggle of people who were in touch with him during the campaign but only with such identifiers as “Campaign Supervisor,” ″Senior Policy Advisor” and “High-Ranking Campaign Official.” Two of the unnamed campaign officials referenced are in fact former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his business associate Rick Gates, both. charged with financial crimes in an indictment unsealed Monday.  The conversations described in charging documents cut to the heart of Mueller’s investigation, reflecting Papadopoulos’ efforts to arrange meetings between Trump aides and Russian government intermediaries and revealing how he learned the Russians had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton in the form of “thousands of emails.”  White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders says Donald Trump campaign staffer George Papadopoulos' guilty plea is an example of a person who ""did the wrong thing"" while ""the president's campaign did the right thing. (Oct. 31)  Though the contacts may not by themselves have been illegal, the oblique but telling references to unnamed people — including “Professor” and “Female Russian National” — make clear that Mueller’s team has identified multiple people who had knowledge of back-and-forth outreach efforts between Russians and associates of the Trump election effort.  It’s a reality that challenges the administration’s portrait of Papadopoulos as a back-bench operator within the campaign, an argument repeated Tuesday by White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who dismissed him as a “volunteer” with a minimal role.  In charging the 30-year-old Papadopoulos with lying to the FBI, Mueller’s team is warning of a similar fate for anyone whose statements deviate from the facts.  “I think everyone to whom Mueller and his team wanted to send a message heard loud and clear the message,” said Jacob Frenkel, a Washington defense lawyer.  The White House had braced over the weekend for an indictment of Manafort and for allegations of financial misconduct that it could dismiss as unrelated to the campaign or administration. Then came the unsealing of Papadopoulos’ guilty plea and an accompanying statement of facts that detailed his desire to set up a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, and his cooperation with prosecutors since his arrest at an airport last summer.  The extent of the contacts is substantial. During a six-month period ending Aug. 15, Papadopoulos met, telephoned, Skyped or emailed his three foreign contacts or five different Trump campaign officials a total of 29 times. He also traveled twice to London and once to Italy. Another trip to Moscow was canceled.  There are clear indications that prosecutors probing possible criminal activity have leaned on Papadopoulos to gather more information about the campaign as they probe possible criminal activity.  He was arrested in July, but the case was not unsealed until Monday, giving prosecutors weeks to debrief him for information. He was initially arrested on false statements and obstruction of justice allegations, but pleaded guilty only to lying to the FBI, a possible token of leniency for further cooperation.  In court papers, prosecutors have said prematurely making the case public would restrict his ability to be a “proactive cooperator,” which legal experts say could including surreptitious techniques like wearing a microphone to record conversations.  “I would infer from that that he was working proactively on behalf of the prosecutors, which would mean going out and obtaining evidence,” said former Justice Department prosecutor Peter Zeidenberg.  Though the campaign officials and other people referenced in the complaint are not named, it’s nonetheless possible to ferret out the identities of several.  For instance, Joseph Mifsud is the “London professor” who figures prominently in the case as a would-be link between the Trump campaign and Russia, according to a comparison of court papers and emails obtained by The Associated Press. Mifsud confirmed to The Telegraph newspaper that he is the professor.  In court papers, Mifsud is described as having met repeatedly with Papadopoulos and having offered to set up meetings with Russian officials who could provide “thousands of emails” with damaging information about Clinton.  Papadopoulos told the FBI he did not tell anyone in the campaign about the “dirt” because he thought the foreign contact might be a “nothing.”  The professor is also credited in the document with introducing Papadopoulos to a woman referred to as a “female Russian national” who served as a potential link to the Russian government. Papadopoulos described her incorrectly in emails to Trump campaign officials as Putin’s niece. She has not yet been identified publicly.  Mifsud, a vocal Putin backer, told the newspaper the FBI case lacks credibility and that he did not tell anyone he could produce emails that would weaken the Clinton campaign.  Papadopoulos’ place on the Trump campaign was formalized in March when Trump adviser Sam Clovis released the names of eight foreign policy advisers amid public pressure on Trump to disclose his foreign policy team.  A lawyer representing Clovis confirmed in a statement that he was the person, identified as the “Campaign Supervisor” in court papers, who brought Papadopoulos onto the advisory committee. In court papers, the unnamed supervisor receives some of Papadopoulos’ email exchanges about his attempts to line up a meeting with the Russians, appearing to encourage the effort at one point by responding “Great work.” He also later encouraged Papadopoulos to travel to Russia on his own.  The lawyer’s statement said Clovis opposed any trip to Russia for Trump or his campaign staff but noted that Clovis may not have made his opposition known when “a volunteer made suggestions on a foreign policy matter.”  The foreign policy advisory council on which Papadopoulos sat met on a monthly basis throughout the spring and summer for a total of about six times, according to an official involved with the group. Papadopoulos, who was based in London at the time, did not attend all of the meetings, but he did attend a dinner meeting of the advisers in late June at the Capitol Hill Club in Washington with Attorney General Jeff Sessions.  Trump released a photo of the meeting on social media.  Papadopoulos, who had no formal responsibilities, communicated most with Clovis and Manafort, according to an official involved with the group who was unauthorized to disclose internal campaign activities. Papadopoulos angered some on the foreign policy team in early May by urging former British Prime Minister David Cameron to apologize after calling Trump “divisive, stupid and wrong.”  ___  Associated Press writers Steve Peoples in Washington and Greg Katz in London contributed to this report.",3.2666666666666666,15,"[0.5, 5.0, 3.5, 1.5, 4.0, 2.0, 0.5, 4.0, 5.0, 1.5, 4.5, 4.5, 5.0, 3.0, 4.5]"

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)  WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans, straining to make last-minute changes to their far-reaching tax proposal, on Tuesday delayed the rollout by a day after they failed to finalize the details.  The plan pushed by President Donald Trump and Republican leaders in Congress is a top legislative priority. The details originally were to be unveiled on Wednesday, but that was delayed until Thursday, said Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee.  The committee had worked throughout the day and evening to produce a plan for the first overhaul of the nation’s tax code in three decades.  “We are making excellent progress. We are very close,” Brady told reporters late Tuesday night. “A lot of work remains with the drafters, they are continuing to work through the night. We are moving forward.”  At the White House, an official said Trump looked forward to seeing legislation this week, adding the administration was confident the delay wouldn’t affect the ultimate timing of the bill. Brady said his panel plans to vote on the bill next week.  Although they had settled on some key details — such as a cut in the corporate tax rate to 20 percent and maintaining the top personal income tax rate for the wealthy of 39.6 percent — other elements still had to be resolved, including the income levels for the tax brackets.  Trump has intensified his lobbying for the nearly $6 trillion tax overhaul plan, seeking a major legislative achievement after the collapse of the health care repeal. Republicans see taxes as a political imperative that will decide whether they keep their congressional majorities in next year’s midterm elections.  The president set an ambitious timetable and predicted a grand signing ceremony before Christmas at “the biggest tax event in the history of our country.”  Late Tuesday, Trump renewed his cheerleading on Twitter.  “The Republican House members are working hard (and late) toward the Massive Tax Cuts that they know you deserve. These will be biggest ever!”  The plan originally unveiled by Trump and congressional Republicans called for shrinking the number of tax brackets from seven to three, with respective tax rates of 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent. That plan drew immediate criticism from Democrats, who complained it was too favorable to the wealthy and undermined Trump’s rhetoric about it benefiting the middle class.  The current Republican plan calls for nearly doubling the standard deduction used by most average Americans to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for families, and increasing the per-child tax credit. In addition to slashing the corporate tax rate, it also seeks to repeal inheritance taxes on multimillion-dollar estates, a big break for the wealthy.  Brady did not answer directly when he was asked — while leaving House Speaker Paul Ryan’s suite Tuesday — whether the drop in the corporate tax rate would happen immediately. But, he said: “I want as much growth right from Day One as I can.”  Trump intensified his lobbying for the tax overhaul plan even as its shape was still under negotiation by the Republicans on Capitol Hill.  “The process is complicated but the end result will not be that complicated. It’s going to be: People are going to pay less tax by a lot, companies are going to pay less tax by a lot - that’s a big difference — and companies are going to start rebuilding and they’re going to stay here,” Trump said in the Roosevelt Room, where he was joined by the heads of more than a dozen business and trade allies.  Trump said he’s directing Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, White House economic adviser Gary Cohn and other administration officials to stay behind when he heads for Asia on Friday so they can help sell the tax proposal. The White House said Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and adviser, had canceled plans to accompany the president to China and South Korea to help push the package.  The president said he was hopeful the House will approve the tax bill by Thanksgiving. But his overly optimistic timetable didn’t address the concerns of lawmakers from states such as New York and New Jersey who have opposed a proposal to eliminate the federal deduction for state and local taxes, arguing it would hurt their constituents and subject them to being taxed twice.  A battle continues over contributions to 401(k) retirements accounts. The financial industry and some Republican lawmakers insist that the GOP plan not change the tax benefits of the popular savings vehicles, as has been floated by GOP leaders.  __  Associated Press writers Andrew Taylor, Marcy Gordon, Erica Werner and Jill Colvin contributed to this report.",3.0,1,[3.0]

Pruitt says he will replace the panels that advise him on science and public health issues with new members holding more diverse views. He announced the changes on Oct. 31, saying many previously appointed to the boards were potentially biased because they had received federal grants. The panels advise EPA on a wide range of issues, including drinking water standards and clean air regulations. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — The head of the Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday he intends to replace the outside experts that advise him on science and public health issues with new board members holding more diverse views.  In announcing the changes, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt suggested many previously appointed to the panels were potentially biased because they had received federal research grants. The 22 boards advise EPA on a wide range of issues, including drinking water standards and pesticide safety.  “Whatever science comes out of EPA shouldn’t be political science,” said Pruitt, a Republican lawyer who previously served as the attorney general of Oklahoma. “From this day forward, EPA advisory committee members will be financially independent from the agency.”  Pruitt has expressed skepticism about the consensus of climate scientists that man-made carbon emissions are the primary cause of global warming. He also overruled experts that had recommended pulling a top-selling pesticide from the market after peer-reviewed studies showed it damaged children’s brains.  Pruitt said he will name new leadership and members to three key EPA advisory boards soon — the Science Advisory Board, Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, and the Board of Scientific Counselors.  It was not clear from the EPA’s media release if all current board members serving out their appointed terms were immediately dismissed. EPA’s press office did not respond to messages seeking clarification on Tuesday.  As part of his directive, Pruitt said he will bar appointees who currently are in receipt of EPA grants or who are in a position to benefit such grants. He exempted people who work at state, local or tribal agencies, saying he wants to introduce more “geographic diversity” to the panels.  The five-page policy Pruitt issued Tuesday makes no mention of other potential conflicts of interest, such as accepting research funding from corporate interests regulated by EPA.  Tuesday’s announcement comes after Pruitt in May said he would not reappoint nine of the 18 members of the Board of Scientific Counselors to serve a second three-year term, as had been customary.  Current board chairwoman Deborah Swackhamer said the members were already required to follow rules intended to prevent conflicts of interests.  “It obviously stacks the deck against scientists who do not represent corporate special interests,” said Swackhamer, a retired professor who taught environmental health sciences at the University of Minnesota. “It speaks volumes that people funded by special interests are OK to be advisers, but not those who have received federal grants.”  Senate Environment Committee Chairman John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican who shares Pruitt’s skepticism of mainstream climate science, cheered the move. He said EPA’s science boards would now better reflect the views of rural states like his own.  But environmentalists worried that Pruitt will now select board members with financial ties to the fossil fuel and chemical industries.  “The Trump EPA’s continued attack on science will likely be one of the most lasting and damaging legacies of this administration,” said Sen. Tom Udall of New Mexico, the ranking Democrat on the appropriations subcommittee that approves EPA’s funding. “Pruitt is purging expert scientists from his science boards — and replacing them with mouthpieces for big polluters.”  ___  Follow Associated Press environmental writer Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck",4.083333333333333,6,"[5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 0.5, 5.0]"

Her name is Heather Swift, not Heather Smith.  A corrected version of the story is below:  2 states warn Trump against big changes in sage grouse plan  Two governors are warning the Trump administration against big changes in a plan to protect a ground-dwelling bird across the West, saying it would send a message to states not to bother cooperating to save other imperiled species  By DAN ELLIOTT  Associated Press  FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) — Two Western governors on Tuesday warned the Trump administration against making big changes in a plan to protect a ground-dwelling bird across the West, saying it would send a message to states not to bother working together to save other imperiled species.  Colorado Democrat John Hickenlooper and Wyoming Republican Matt Mead said a 2015 conservation plan designed to save the greater sage grouse was the product of long negotiation among state and federal governments, conservation groups, industry and agriculture.  “If we go down a different road now with the sage grouse, what it says is, when you try to address other endangered species problems in this country, don’t have a collaborative process, don’t work together, because it’s going to be changed,” Mead said. “To me, that would be a very unfortunate circumstance.”  Hickenlooper said, “We are both very concerned that the new administration is going to take away all the guide rails that allowed this collaboration to exist.”  They appeared together at an energy conference at Colorado State University.  The 2015 plan is designed to protect the bird without putting it on the Endangered Species List, an outcome that most states try to avoid because it usually brings strict restrictions on oil and gas drilling, mining, agriculture and other activities to protect habitat.  But Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said in June his department would consider changing the plan to give states more flexibility to allow mining, logging and other economic development. Environmentalists have said the planned revision was just a back-door attempt to open up more land to mining and drilling.  Millions of sage grouse once lived across the U.S. West, but development, disease, livestock grazing and an invasive grass that encourages wildfires has reduced its number to fewer than 500,000.  The 2015 plan covers 11 states and had the approval of the Obama administration. It took years to negotiate and was hailed as a model for saving a species through cooperation, rather than the hammer of the Endangered Species Act.  The Interior Department has not released the full details of its planned revisions, but the agency announced in early October it would withdraw protections for about 15,600 square miles (40,000 square kilometers) of sage grouse habitat on federal lands to allow energy development.  Despite Mead’s support for the 2015 plan, Interior Department spokeswoman Heather Swift said the department has been in contact with Wyoming officials “and many, many others who took serious issue with the Obama-era plans.”  “We look forward to continuing to work with the governor on this and many other issues,” Swift said in an email to The Associated Press.  Mead said protecting endangered species has become a serious problem, citing figures that show less than 2 percent of the species protected under the act since it was passed in 1973 have recovered enough to be removed from the list.  “Now, if you care about species, or you care about energy production or you care about commerce, we’ve got to do better than that, and a collaborative process that brings in Western states on endangered species, in my mind, is the best way to go,” he said.  Not all Western governors support the 2015 plan. Idaho Republican C. L. “Butch” Otter filed a lawsuit shortly after the plan was released, contending the Obama administration illegally imposed federal land-use restrictions. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit in January, but Otter has appealed.  ___  This story has been corrected to show the Interior Department announced it would consider changing the plan in June, not August.  ___  Follow Dan Elliott at http://twitter.com/DanElliottAP.

Neanderthals had a long run in Europe and Asia, but they disappeared about 40,000 years ago after modern humans showed up from Africa. (AP Photo/Laurent Cipriani)  NEW YORK (AP) — What killed off the Neanderthals? It’s a big debate, and now a study says that no matter what the answer, they were doomed anyway.  Our close evolutionary cousins enjoyed a long run in Europe and Asia, but they disappeared about 40,000 years ago after modern humans showed up from Africa.  The search for an explanation has produced many theories including climate change, epidemics, or inability to compete with the modern humans, who may have had some mental or cultural edge.  The new study isn’t intended to argue against those factors, but just to show that they’re not needed to explain the extinction, says Oren Kolodny of Stanford University.  He and colleague Marcus Feldman present their approach in a paper released Tuesday by the journal Nature Communications.  They based their conclusion on a computer simulation that represented small bands of Neanderthals and modern humans in Europe and Asia. These local populations were randomly chosen to go extinct, and then be replaced by another randomly chosen population, with no regard for whether it represented the same species.  Neither species was assumed to have any inherent advantage, but there was one crucial difference: Unlike the Neanderthals, the modern humans were supplemented by reinforcements coming in from Africa. It wasn’t a huge wave, but rather “a tiny, tiny trickle of small bands,” Kolodny said.  Still, that was enough to tip the balance against the Neanderthals. They generally went extinct when the simulation was run more than a million times under a variety of assumptions.  If survival was a game of chance, “it was rigged by the fact that there’s recurring migration,” Kolodny said. “The game was doomed to end with the Neanderthals losing.”  Kolodny said the evidence that such migrations actually occurred is suggestive rather than conclusive. Such migrations would not be expected to leave much of an archaeological trace, he said.  Experts in human origins said the paper could help scientists pin down the various factors that led to the Neanderthals’ demise. It fits in with other recent attempts to explain the extinction without assuming behavioral differences between Neanderthals and our ancestors, said Wil Roebroeks of the University of Leiden in the Netherlands. The notion of such differences is largely disproven, he said.  Katerina Harvati of the University of Tuebingen in Germany said while the new work could be useful in solving the extinction mystery, it doesn’t address the question of why modern humans dispersed from Africa into Europe and Asia.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan)  NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon’s top-of-the-line e-reader is now waterproof — an excellent feature for a $250-and-up investment.  But don’t go scuba diving just yet. Your Kindle Oasis might not survive.  Huh? How is that waterproof then? And what about the optional cover?  ___  THE FINE PRINT ON WATERPROOF  The new Oasis is designed to survive up to an hour in up to two meters (6.5 feet) of fresh water, not the higher pressure of anything deeper — such as a scuba dive.  Fresh-water protection is great, but you’re more likely to read by a swimming pool or on the beach. Amazon says you’ll still get some protection from chlorinated or salty water — just not as much as what’s promised for fresh water. Same goes for coffee spills.  As for that cover, the standard version with woven fabric ($45) is “water safe” but not “waterproof.” Amazon says that means minor spills, but not lengthy submersion. To be safe, choose a dark color to conceal any stains. The pricier leather covers ($60) won’t resist water at all, which defeats having a waterproof e-reader in the first place.  ___  READING WHEN WET  Waterproofing is meant to protect the device from accidental splashes and spills, not underwater reading.  Common with other gadgets, the touchscreen gets errant when wet. Reading during an ice-cold bath was fine, until I submerged the device. The font size started changing, and all sorts of other settings popped up. During a hot shower, pages turned on their own.  While walking in a storm, rainwater distorted the text, like a magnifying glass, and I had to wipe many drops away. (In any case, I probably should have been paying attention instead to what’s in front of me.)  ___  OTHER FEATURES  Overall, the Oasis is a great device for booklovers — though the waterproofing, with its limits, isn’t enough on its own to justify the premium model.  You can pair the new Kindle with Bluetooth headsets and enjoy integration with Amazon’s Audible audiobook service. You can switch between the text and audio versions of your book without losing your place. Unfortunately, you have to buy both versions to do this.  The larger 7-inch screen on the Oasis makes the other devices’ once-adequate 6-inch screens seem too small. Amazon says the Oasis fits 30 percent more words. The Oasis also has more built-in lights for greater brightness. And unlike phones and tablets, the e-reader isn’t prone to glare — or to such distractions as Facebook and text notifications.

Female mayoral candidates dominate in Seattle,"In this photo taken Tuesday, Oct. 24, 2017, Seattle mayoral candidates Jenny Durkan, left, and Cary Moon applaud the audience at the end of a televised debate in Seattle. After 91 years Seattle will elect its second female mayor next week. Voters will choose urban planner Moon or former U.S. attorney Durkan to lead this city dealing with the benefits and headaches of a booming economy for some more than others as e-commerce giant Amazon expands. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson)  SEATTLE (AP) — When political consultant Cathy Allen and others learned the top four vote-getters in Seattle’s mayoral primary race were women, she paused to think.  “When was the last time Seattle had a woman mayor?” she wondered. A few prominent women who ran unsuccessfully over the years sprang to mind, but not any who won. So Allen checked and discovered the last female mayor of the Pacific Northwest’s largest city was elected in 1926.  “We’re sitting here going, ‘This can’t be,’” she said. “This is our progressive city.”  After 91 years, Seattle is poised to elect its second female mayor next week. Voters will choose between urban planner Cary Moon or former U.S. attorney Jenny Durkan to lead this city dealing with the benefits and headaches of an economy booming for some more than others as e-commerce giant Amazon expands. There are the only two candidates on the ballot.  Just a few months ago, neither woman was even in the race. Former Mayor Ed Murray was expected to easily win re-election after pushing through increases to the city’s minimum wage and emerging as a vocal opponent of President Donald Trump, who was trounced by Seattle voters in 2016. But Murray dropped his bid in May following accusations of sexual abuse by multiple men. He resigned in September.  In the August primary, Durkan, Moon, community activist Nikkita Oliver and former state lawmaker Jessyn Farrell took the four top spots.  The shock many Seattleites felt when Hillary Clinton lost to Trump could have played a part in the strong showing by this year’s female mayoral candidates, Allen said. Two well-known male candidates - state Sen. Bob Hasegawa and former Mayor Mike McGinn - finished a distant fifth and sixth in the primary.  There’s been a realization that “women are not nearly as equal as we figured we were,” said Allen, who has helped train female candidates in dozens of countries working with the national Women’s Political Caucus and the State Department.  Moon said attending the Women’s March in January in Washington, D.C., inspired her to run.  “There’s been a massive shift,” Moon said. “A lot of women are feeling a responsibility to step up and offer a different kind of leadership in politics.”  As of July 2016, only 19 percent of U.S. cities had a woman as mayor, according to the U.S. Conference of Mayors. And just 6 percent of the country’s top paid CEOs last year were women, an analysis by executive data firm Equilar and The Associated Press found.  “Every job I’ve ever had I’ve faced barriers because I’m a woman,” Durkan said.  The race between Durkan and Moon has keyed on how the city will respond to changes largely brought by Amazon, which employs about 40,000 people in Seattle. Housing prices have skyrocketed amid constant complaints about traffic and worries that the poor and middle class are being priced out.  Durkan, backed by the city’s business and labor establishment, has touted her managerial experience as a prosecutor. Moon, meanwhile, who formerly managed her family’s manufacturing business, has stressed her 20 years of activism on transit, waterfront and other city issues. During the campaign, both said they have been treated differently based on gender.  Durkan, who says she’s the first openly gay person to become a U.S. attorney, said she no longer looks at social media comments because so many are sexist and homophobic.  “Any woman who’s had any job is aware that you’re always pulled between various narratives: Are you going to cry, or are you an ice princess?” she said.  Moon said she gets asked if she’s tough enough for the job.  “Leadership is not about knocking heads together. It’s about leading,” she said. “But yes, when it comes time to settle a dispute, of course I can do that. There’s nothing in my resume that presumes I couldn’t do that.”  Bertha Knight Landes was elected Seattle’s mayor 16 years after women won the right to vote in Washington and just six years after women won the right to vote nationally.

Also pictured is Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., second from left, and, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., right. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)  NEW YORK (AP) — Facebook, Twitter and Google acknowledged to U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday that Russian-linked accounts began exploiting their services in 2015 to sway last year’s presidential election. Lawyers for the companies were grilled about why they didn’t notice how their platforms were misused earlier, and about what they have done — and will do — to prevent such abuse from happening again.  Here are five things the companies need to tell Congress:  WHY SO LATE?  The election was nearly a year ago. Why did it take so long for Facebook, Google and Twitter to see how their platforms were used by foreign actors to influence the election?  Congress would really like to know. As Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., put it: “People are buying ads on your platform with rubles. They are political ads. You put billions of data points together all the time, that’s what I hear that these platforms do. They are the most sophisticated things invented by man, ever. Google has all knowledge that man has ever developed. You can’t put together rubles with a political ad and go like, ‘Hmmm, those data points spell out something pretty bad.’”  In hindsight, Facebook general counsel Colin Stretch acknowledged, the company should have had a “broader lens.” He also noted that the company published research in April disclosing that governments and other malicious non-state actors were using its social network to influence elections — though the company didn’t directly name Russia at the time.  WAS IT JUST RUSSIA?  It’s already illegal for Russians and other foreigners to pay for U.S. political ads. But some lawmakers suggested there was no way for tech companies to know if entities from other countries — like China, North Korea, or, in one memorable exchange, Turkmenistan — had also misused their platforms. After all, they didn’t know about Russia’s efforts for a long time, either.  With 5 million advertisers every month, Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy asked of Facebook, “How can you be aware?” Especially, he said, when companies and others can hide behind shell companies to mask their true identities.  Stretch stopped short of saying with certainty that other countries didn’t purchase misleading or false ads on Facebook.  PUBLISHERS OR PLATFORMS?  Kennedy also asked Richard Salgado, Google’s director of law enforcement and information security, whether the company is a “newspaper” or a neutral tech platform. Salgado replied that Google is a tech company, to which Kennedy quipped, “that’s what I thought you’d say.”  The other two companies also consider themselves technology platforms that merely allow newspapers and other media companies to share information. But at a time when millions of Americans count Facebook, Twitter and Google their primary news sources, the companies will likely have to try harder to convince lawmakers and the public that they are not in the media business.  The distinction is important when it comes to regulation. Tech platforms are generally not responsible for the content on their sites. Media companies are.  IS THERE MORE?  Facebook has already disclosed that content generated by a Russian internet agency potentially reached as many as 126 million users. Twitter told the same subcommittee that it has uncovered and shut down 2,752 accounts linked to Russia’s Internet Research Agency, which is known for promoting pro-Russian government positions.  And Google said it found evidence of “limited” misuse of its services by the Russian group, as well as some YouTube channels that were likely backed by Russian agents.  But was this all? The companies are not done with their investigations into Russian interference — and Congress may just be getting warmed up.  CAN THEY FIX THE PROBLEMS WITHOUT REGULATION?  Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar pressed representatives of Facebook, Google and Twitter to declare whether they will support the “Honest Ads” bill she has introduced with Sen. Mark Warner, which would bring political ad rules from TV, radio and print to the internet. Each of the tech giants offered only qualified support rather than a straight “yes.”  Klobuchar noted that none of the companies included “issue ads” in their updated advertising policies — even though that’s what the majority of the Russia-linked ads were. Rather than outright supporting a political candidate, these ads deal with hot-button issues like race and immigration and are designed to sow discord among the public.  “Obviously it would be easier if everyone had the same rules,” she said.  __  Associated Press writers Michael Liedtke and Ryan Nakashima in San Francisco and Tom LoBianco in Washington contributed to this story.",2.923076923076923,26,"[1.5, 0.5, 4.5, 4.0, 3.0, 3.0, 4.0, 1.0, 4.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5, 3.0, 0.5, 2.5, 0.5, 3.5, 4.5, 0.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.0]"
1283,2882,11,2,2017,2017-11-02,Associated Press News,"Russia hackers pursued Putin foes, not just US Democrats"," It wasn’t just Hillary Clinton’s emails they went after.  The hackers who disrupted the U.S. presidential election last year had ambitions that stretched across the globe, targeting the emails of Ukrainian officers, Russian opposition figures, U.S. defense contractors and thousands of others of interest to the Kremlin, according to a previously unpublished digital hit list obtained by The Associated Press.  The list provides the most detailed forensic evidence yet of the close alignment between the hackers and the Russian government, exposing an operation that went back years and tried to break into the inboxes of 4,700 Gmail users — from the pope’s representative in Kiev to the punk band Pussy Riot in Moscow. The targets were spread among 116 countries.  “It’s a wish list of who you’d want to target to further Russian interests,” said Keir Giles, director of the Conflict Studies Research Center in Cambridge, England, and one of five outside experts who reviewed the AP’s findings. He said the data was “a master list of individuals whom Russia would like to spy on, embarrass, discredit or silence.”  The AP findings draw on a database of 19,000 malicious links collected by cybersecurity firm Secureworks, dozens of rogue emails, and interviews with more than 100 hacking targets.  Secureworks stumbled upon the data after a hacking group known as Fancy Bear accidentally exposed part of its phishing operation to the internet. The list revealed a direct line between the hackers and the leaks that rocked the presidential contest in its final stages, most notably the private emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.  The issue of who hacked the Democrats is back in the national spotlight following the revelation Monday that a Donald Trump campaign official, George Papadopoulos, was briefed early last year that the Russians had “dirt” on Clinton, including “thousands of emails.”  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the notion that Russia interfered “unfounded.” But the list examined by AP provides powerful evidence that the Kremlin did just that.  “This is the Kremlin and the general staff,” said Andras Racz, a specialist in Russian security policy at Pazmany Peter Catholic University in Hungary, as he examined the data.  “I have no doubts.”  ___  THE NEW EVIDENCE  Secureworks’ list covers the period between March 2015 and May 2016. Most of the identified targets were in the United States, Ukraine, Russia, Georgia and Syria.  In the United States, which was Russia’s Cold War rival, Fancy Bear tried to pry open at least 573 inboxes belonging to those in the top echelons of the country’s diplomatic and security services: then-Secretary of State John Kerry, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, then-NATO Supreme Commander, U.S. Air Force Gen. Philip Breedlove, and one of his predecessors, U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark.  The list skewed toward workers for defense contractors such as Boeing, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin or senior intelligence figures, prominent Russia watchers and — especially — Democrats. More than 130 party workers, campaign staffers and supporters of the party were targeted, including Podesta and other members of Clinton’s inner circle.  The AP also found a handful of Republican targets.  Podesta, Powell, Breedlove and more than a dozen Democratic targets besides Podesta would soon find their private correspondence dumped to the web. The AP has determined that all had been targeted by Fancy Bear, most of them three to seven months before the leaks.  “They got two years of email,” Powell recently told AP. He said that while he couldn’t know for sure who was responsible, “I always suspected some Russian connection.”  In Ukraine, which is fighting a grinding war against Russia-backed separatists, Fancy Bear attempted to break into at least 545 accounts, including those of President Petro Poroshenko and his son Alexei, half a dozen current and former ministers such as Interior Minister Arsen Avakov and as many as two dozen current and former lawmakers.  The list includes Serhiy Leshchenko, an opposition parliamentarian who helped uncover the off-the-books payments allegedly made to Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort — whose indictment was unsealed Monday in Washington.  In Russia, Fancy Bear focused on government opponents and dozens of journalists. Among the targets were oil tycoon-turned-Kremlin foe Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who spent a decade in prison and now lives in exile, and Pussy Riot’s Maria Alekhina. Along with them were 100 more civil society figures, including anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny and his lieutenants.  “Everything on this list fits,” said Vasily Gatov, a Russian media analyst who was himself among the targets. He said Russian authorities would have been particularly interested in Navalny, one of the few opposition leaders with a national following.  Many of the targets have little in common except that they would have been crossing the Kremlin’s radar: an environmental activist in the remote Russian port city of Murmansk; a small political magazine in Armenia; the Vatican’s representative in Kiev; an adult education organization in Kazakhstan.  “It’s simply hard to see how any other country would be particularly interested in their activities,” said Michael Kofman, an expert on Russian military affairs at the Woodrow Wilson International Center in Washington. He was also on the list.  “If you’re not Russia,” he said, “hacking these people is a colossal waste of time.”  ___  WORKING 9 TO 6 MOSCOW TIME  Allegations that Fancy Bear works for Russia aren’t new. But raw data has been hard to come by.  Researchers have been documenting the group’s activities for more than a decade and many have accused it of being an extension of Russia’s intelligence services. The “Fancy Bear” nickname is a none-too-subtle reference to Russia’s national symbol.  In the wake of the 2016 election, U.S. intelligence agencies publicly endorsed the consensus view, saying what American spooks had long alleged privately: Fancy Bear is a creature of the Kremlin.  But the U.S. intelligence community provided little proof, and even media-friendly cybersecurity companies typically publish only summaries of their data.  That makes the Secureworks’ database a key piece of public evidence — all the more remarkable because it’s the result of a careless mistake.  Secureworks effectively stumbled across it when a researcher began working backward from a server tied to one of Fancy Bear’s signature pieces of malicious software.  He found a hyperactive Bitly account that Fancy Bear (which Secureworks calls “Iron Twilight”) was using to sneak thousands of malicious links past Google’s spam filter. Because Fancy Bear forgot to set the account to private, Secureworks spent the next few months hovering over the group’s shoulder, quietly copying down the details of the thousands of emails it was targeting.  The AP obtained the data recently, boiling it down to 4,700 individual email addresses, and then connecting roughly half to account holders. The AP validated the list by running it against a sample of phishing emails obtained from people targeted and comparing it to similar rosters gathered independently by other cybersecurity companies, such as Tokyo-based Trend Micro and the Slovakian firm ESET .  The Secureworks data allowed reporters to determine that more than 95 percent of the malicious links were generated during Moscow office hours — between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. Monday to Friday.  The AP’s findings also track with a report that first brought Fancy Bear to the attention of American voters. In 2016, a cybersecurity company known as CrowdStrike said the Democratic National Committee had been compromised by Russian hackers, including Fancy Bear.  Secureworks’ roster shows Fancy Bear making aggressive attempts to hack into DNC technical staffers’ emails in early April 2016 — exactly when CrowdStrike says the hackers broke in.  And the raw data enabled the AP to speak directly to the people who were targeted, many of whom pointed the finger at the Kremlin.  “We have no doubts about who is behind these attacks,” said Artem Torchinskiy, a project coordinator with Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Fund who was targeted three times in 2015. “I am sure these are hackers controlled by Russian secret services.”  ___  THE MYTH OF THE 400-POUND MAN  Even if only a small fraction of the 4,700 Gmail accounts targeted by Fancy Bear were hacked successfully, the data drawn from them could run into terabytes — easily rivaling the biggest known leaks in journalistic history.  For the hackers to have made sense of that mountain of messages — in English, Ukrainian, Russian, Georgian, Arabic and many other languages — they would have needed a substantial team of analysts and translators. Merely identifying and sorting the targets took six AP reporters eight weeks of work.  The AP’s effort offers “a little feel for how much labor went into this,” said Thomas Rid, a professor of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies.  In response to the AP’s investigation, the DNC issued a statement saying the evidence that Russia had interfered in the election was “irrefutable.”  Rid said the investigation should put to rest any theories like the one then-candidate Donald Trump floated last year that the hacks could be the work of “someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.”  “The notion that it’s just a lone hacker somewhere is utterly absurd,” Rid said.  ___  Donn reported from Plymouth, Massachusetts.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)  WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans would leave intact current tax rules on retirement accounts popular with middle class Americans and maintain a top income tax rate for million-dollar earners as negotiators scrambled to finalize the first major overhaul in three decades.  The legislation is a long-standing goal for Capitol Hill Republicans who see a once-in-a-generation opportunity to clean up an inefficient, loophole-cluttered tax code. But there is lingering opposition from northeastern Republicans fearful of losing a cherished deduction for state and local taxes and anxiety among other rank-and-file lawmakers over emerging details.  Senior GOP lawmakers confirmed the decision to retain existing rules on 401(k) accounts, which came after assurances from President Donald Trump that they would not be changed. Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, had hoped to reduce 401(k) contribution limits, in part to generate new tax revenues in the near term to finance the cuts to income tax rates.  Another lawmaker cautioned that the decision might still change. The lawmakers required anonymity because the tax panel is trying to keep its deliberations secret until the tax measure is released Thursday.  Influential conservative Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., dismissed proposed retirement changes as a “non-starter,” adding “that’s what most of middle-income America uses as their nest egg.”  Brady said the panel hoped to meet Trump’s goal of a cut in the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent but allowed that the change would not be permanent because of arcane Senate rules.  Republicans and Trump argue sharply cutting tax rates for businesses improves U.S. economic competitiveness, but the possibility of letting the lower corporate rates expire is rankling some longtime advocates who say the uncertainty could limit its boost to the economy.  Top Republicans vowed to release the measure on Thursday after missing a self-imposed Wednesday deadline and dismissed rumors that the unveiling might be further delayed. The ambitious timetable calls for passing the measure in the House by Thanksgiving.  “Failure is not an option,” said Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y.  The emerging plan would retain the Clinton-era 39.6 percent income tax rate for the wealthiest earners. But for that highest bracket, the tax writers were considering raising the minimum level of income to $1 million for couples or families from the current $470,000 — a change that would reduce tax revenue.  Trump weighed in Wednesday on Twitter: “Wouldn’t it be great to Repeal the very unfair and unpopular Individual Mandate in ObamaCare and use those savings for further Tax Cuts for the Middle Class. The House and Senate should consider ASAP as the process of final approval moves along. Push Biggest Tax Cuts EVER.”  The idea of repealing the individual mandate has been pushed by Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, but was dismissed by key GOP leaders since it would add political complications to an already difficult task of crafting a tax bill that can pass the House and Senate.  “I think tax reform is complicated enough without adding another layer of complexity,” said No. 2 Senate Republican John Cornyn of Texas. Rep. Kristi Noem, R-S.D., a participant in the talks as a member of the tax-writing panel, said there was insufficient support among committee Republicans to include it in the bill.  GOP leaders still struggled to win over lawmakers from New York and New Jersey, many of whom are opposed to repealing a lucrative deduction for state and local taxes that benefits their states more than others.  A potential compromise involved a $10,000 cap to the deduction for local property taxes while repealing the deduction for income taxes.  “I view the elimination of the deduction as a geographic redistribution of wealth picking winners and losers,” said Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., who represents eastern Long Island. “I don’t want my home state to be a loser, and that really shouldn’t come as any surprise.”  The plan outline released last month by Trump and Republican leaders in Congress called for shrinking the number of tax brackets from seven to three or four, with respective tax rates of 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent and to be determined. The tax system would be simplified, and most people would be able to file their returns on a postcard-sized form.  The plan calls for nearly doubling the standard deduction used by most average Americans to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for families, and increasing the per-child tax credit. In addition to slashing the corporate tax rate, it also seeks to repeal inheritance taxes on multimillion-dollar estates, a big break for the wealthy.  Meadows said he was worried about eligibility limits that could prevent some businesses from taking advantage of a lower 25 percent tax rate.  “How as a Republican can we pick winners and losers that way? I mean it makes absolutely certifiably no sense,” Meadows said.  The president set an aggressive timetable for the legislation and predicted a grand signing ceremony before Christmas at “the biggest tax event in the history of our country.”  Democrats have repeatedly complained the plan was too favorable to business and the wealthy and contradicted Trump’s rhetoric of bringing relief and economic benefit to the stressed middle class.  __  Associated Press writer Alan Fram contributed to this report.  ___  This story has been corrected to show the current corporate tax rate is 35 percent not 39 percent.",3.1666666666666665,6,"[4.5, 3.0, 0.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0]"

Trump is calling for “Merit Based immigration” following the truck attack in New York City that killed eight people and injured 11. Trump says on Twitter Wednesday that the driver in Tuesday’s attack “came into our country through what is called the ‘Diversity Visa Lottery Program,’ a Chuck Schumer beauty.” (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Roused by the first major ISIS-inspired attack on U.S. soil since he took office, President Donald Trump urged swift repeal of an immigration program that brought the suspect to America and laid into a political foe he said was responsible for it — though Republican George H. W. Bush signed the law.  Trump insisted Wednesday that Congress must end the visa lottery program under which Uzbek immigrant Sayfullo Saipov entered the country, and he ordered still tighter scrutiny of immigrants already subject to what he calls “extreme vetting.” But the White House offered no indication of what new steps the president might be planning.  “We have to get much tougher, much smarter, and less politically correct,” Trump said. He also said the U.S. justice system for dealing with such cases must be strengthened, declaring, “What we have right now is a joke and it’s a laughingstock.” Again, there was no elaboration from the White House.  Trump denounced the 29-year-old suspect in the truck attack, which killed eight and injured many more, as an “animal,” and said he was open to sending the man to the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, instead of to trial in New York. “I would certainly consider that. Send him to Gitmo,” Trump said.  President Donald Trump says he will consider sending the suspected New York City truck attacker to the prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. (Nov. 1)  Spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the White House considered Saipov an “enemy combatant” and had yet to decide whether to seek to move him out of the civilian judicial system to military detention.  A little later, however, prosecutors in New York filed charges in federal court accusing Saipov with providing material support to a terrorist group and committing violence and destruction of motor vehicles.  On the political front, Trump took to Twitter early Wednesday to blame Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat who represents New York, for the bipartisan visa program used by the suspect to enter the country in 2010.  The Department of Homeland Security confirmed that Saipov entered the U.S under the Diversity Visa Lottery Program, which gives people from countries with low rates of immigration an opportunity to come to the U.S. Trump branded the program “a Chuck Schumer beauty,” and called on Congress to immediately begin work to end it.  It was not immediately clear when Saipov was radicalized by the Islamic State group, but the New York City Police Department said he began planning the attack weeks ago.  Schumer did back the lottery program as a member of the House when it was approved with the support of both parties in 1990. It was signed by Republican President George H.W. Bush.  Trump’s broadside against a senator from the state still reeling from the attack drew bipartisan criticism.  New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that Trump’s attack against Schumer “plays right into the hands of the terrorists,” by sowing division at a time when unity is needed. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said it was “probably not the best way to bring out the best in our country.” Corker, who has announced he will not run for re-election in 2018, has been increasingly critical of Trump’s temperament.  Schumer himself offered this advice: “The president ought to stop tweeting and start leading.”  Sanders later said Trump “has not blamed Senator Schumer and doesn’t feel that the senator is responsible for the attack.”  Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, defended Trump’s criticism of the visa lottery program.  “The diversity lottery visa’s been criticized by many people as being pretty indiscriminate in terms of who’s accepted into the country. I think it needs to be looked at. And I agree with the president that it can certainly be improved by more of a merit-based system.”  Sanders dismissed complaints that Trump was politicizing a tragedy, saying his calls for increasing extreme vetting of immigrants are “something that frankly the president has been talking about for a long time.”  Indeed, Trump has made repeated attempts to restrict entry into the country through various iterations of a travel ban, which have been blocked by federal courts. The administration has argued that it needs a temporary pause on entry from certain countries in order to develop stricter vetting measures and put them in place.  In the meantime, the administration has worked to improve information-sharing with various countries. It also has developed new requirements for entry into the U.S., such as the use of biometric passports that are more difficult to forge.  Officials could not elaborate on what new measures Trump was referring to in his tweet hours after the attack when he said he had “just ordered Homeland Security to step up our already Extreme Vetting Program.”  Sanders said that, since the tweet, the president had spoken several times with members of his national security team to “look and see” what more can be done.  “But,” she said, “we have put in place executive orders already since the president’s taken office that help go as far as we can at this point.”  Trump’s swift political response to the New York attacks contrasts with his wait-and-see approach after the October massacre of 59 people by a Las Vegas gunman. The White House then argued it was “premature” to discuss a legislative response and says now it is still studying whether to seek a ban on the modifications used by the Las Vegas shooter to fire his rifles at near-automatic rates.  The two responses offer the latest suggestions of how the culture wars that defined Trump’s campaign may be coloring his actions.  During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump proposed a total ban on Muslim immigration to the U.S. before embracing “extreme vetting.” He has backed legislation that would curb legal immigration and shift the nation toward a system that would place an emphasis on merit and skills over family ties and diversity criteria.  Trump late Wednesday repeated his call. “CHAIN MIGRATION must end now!” he tweeted. “Some people come in, and they bring their whole family with them, who can be truly evil.

1297,2896,11,1,2017,2017-11-01,Associated Press News,NASA chief nominee promises to keep politics out of agency," President Donald Trump’s nominee for NASA chief is promising to run the space agency on a consensus agenda driven by science.  Republican Rep. Jim Bridenstine’s assurances, however, failed to placate Senate Democrats at a contentious confirmation hearing on Wednesday, with several revisiting the Oklahoma lawmaker’s past statements on climate change, gays and immigrants and his brief management of a Tulsa museum that lost money during his leadership.  Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, the top Democrat on the Senate Commerce panel, called Bridenstine “divisive and extreme.” Nelson highlighted Bridenstine’s past statements attacking Democrats and fellow Republicans, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Arizona Sen. John McCain and former House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, for bipartisan efforts.  “These are some of the most divisive tactics that this senator has ever seen in any party and this is just attacking people in your own party,” Nelson said. “How do you keep NASA from being dragged down in a divisive political background?”  Bridenstine said politics ends for him when it comes to space and national security issues.  “I want to make sure that NASA remains, as you said, apolitical,” he told Nelson.  Nelson and other Democrats said past NASA chiefs were not political and mostly scientists and ex-astronauts, but Bridenstine pointed to legendary NASA chief James Webb , who shepherded the Apollo program in the 1960s, as a veteran political appointee. If confirmed Bridenstine would be the first administrator who was a former elected legislator, but the U.S. Navy Reserve pilot said that shouldn’t disqualify him.  Calling his fellow Oklahoman a leader on weather issues, Sen. Jim Inhofe quoted others and said, “It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to run NASA.”  Democrats pressed Bridenstine to acknowledge that humans cause global warming because of past statements of his that questioned the science. He did. He even explained a bit how carbon dioxide changes the climate.  “I’m happy to say it to anyone else because it’s the truth,” Bridenstine said. However, despite pressing by Democrats he wouldn’t say whether humans are the main cause of climate change, which is what NASA says.  Bridenstine vowed not to allow politics to interfere with science even on climate change, even if the Trump administration insists.  “I think in the end the votes will be there,” Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee Chairman John Thune said. “The Democrats came trying to rough up the NASA nominee. That was pretty clear.”  Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., questioned Bridenstine over his leadership of the Tulsa Air and Space Museum, noting that before Bridenstine ran the museum it had a surplus, but once he took over it had more than a $300,000 deficit.  Initially, Bridenstine said those numbers “are not true.”  Later Nelson and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., produced the IRS tax filings. Those filings show a $73,288 surplus in 2008 before Bridenstine and deficits of $311,655 in 2009 and $308,305 after Bridenstine was hired as director.  Bridenstine said it was the first time he had seen the filings in seven years and the museum was using cash reserves with the board’s approval on big projects: an air show and a failed attempt to lure a retired space shuttle to Tulsa.  For his part, Bridenstine tried to focus on the agency’s future not his past. He said that soon Americans will be launching to orbit on American-built rockets from the United States.  “I believe in this administration’s vision of getting to Mars and using the moon as a proving ground,” Bridenstine said.  ___  Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears.

The newly found populations of western glacier stonefly appear to face the same problem as the original population in and around Glacier National Park, where habitat loss due to climate change is reducing water flows in the mountain streams where the insects live.  “We expect climate change to be acting range-wide, even in these new habitats that were found,” said biologist Jim Boyd with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  The winged insects live along streams fed by melting glaciers and snowfields. They’ve recently been confirmed in Montana’s Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness and Wyoming’s Grand Teton National Park.  The glacier stonefly and another species known as the meltwater lednian stonefly were proposed for protections under the Endangered Species Act in October 2016. A final decision was expected last month, but that’s now been put off until early 2018 as the government considers the new information on the glacier stonefly, officials said.  Boyd said one species could be given protections but not the other.  By 2030, the amount of stream habitat available to the meltwater lednian stonefly is expected to decrease more than 80 percent. Similar habitat losses are projected for the western glacier stonefly.  Last year’s decision came after the Center for Biological Diversity and the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation petitioned the federal government to enact protections for the two species.  Noah Greenwald with the Center for Biological Diversity said his group will be watching for any political interference as the issue is reconsidered.  President Donald Trump earlier this year said he was cancelling U.S. involvement in an international climate treaty and has previously suggested global warming is a hoax perpetuated by the Chinese.  “When they make the decision do they deny, because we have a climate-denier-in-chief? Or do they move forward with protections that are certainly warranted?” Greenwald said. “It just highlights that if we don’t get control of our greenhouse gas emissions we have a lot to lose.”",3.6,15,"[1.5, 4.0, 4.0, 2.5, 3.5, 2.0, 5.0, 3.0, 5.0, 5.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.5, 5.0, 4.0]"

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)  BEIJING (AP) — Academic publisher Springer Nature said Wednesday it has blocked access to articles within China to comply with demands from the Chinese government, amid a push by Beijing to tighten controls on information from outside the country.  The company said in a statement that less than 1 percent of its content available online in global markets has been blocked in China in compliance with “local distribution laws.”  “This action is deeply regrettable but has been taken to prevent a much greater impact on our customers and authors and is in compliance with our published policy,” the statement said. “This is not editorial censorship and does not affect the content we publish or make accessible elsewhere in the world.”  Springer Nature, which has offices around the world, says it has published more than 275,000 books and 3,000 journals, including “Nature” and “Scientific American.”  The move is the latest example of how effective China can be at leveraging its economic might to compel foreign companies to make concessions in order to maintain access to its massive market. Chinese President Xi Jinping’s government has tightened controls over information and over a wide range of groups that could feed opposition to the ruling Communist Party, including lawyers who take on sensitive cases, non-governmental organizations and churches.  The blocked articles related to topics such as Taiwan, the 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution and the status of Tibet, which are considered sensitive by the Communist Party, according to a survey by The Associated Press. They can only be viewed with a virtual private network that allows users to skirt China’s strict internet censorship regime, known as the Great Firewall.  The newspaper Financial Times reported that at least 1,000 articles were blocked.  In August, academic publisher Cambridge University Press restored more than 300 politically sensitive articles that had been removed from the publisher’s website in China at the behest of authorities.  Its action followed a petition circulated among academics calling on the university press to turn down censorship requests from the Chinese government. The temporarily blocked articles also touched on the Tiananmen crackdown, Tibet and similar topics.  As of Wednesday, CUP’s website, The China Quarterly, was fully accessible in China.  Academics say that Chinese universities, which have long endured some degree of political interference, have also come under increased supervision, including regular monitoring in classrooms and ideological audits.  Springer Nature said failure to block some of the articles as required by its distributors, who it said are the “officially appointed guardians of all content,” could have led to its entire SpringerLink website being blocked.  “Access to 99 percent of Springer Nature content is therefore safeguarded for all our customers in China and we will continue to work with the regulator and other Chinese authorities to minimize the content affected, reduce and ideally eliminate these restrictions on behalf of the global research community and wider society,” the company said.",3.5714285714285716,7,"[3.5, 4.0, 3.0, 3.0, 5.0, 4.0, 2.5]"

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)  SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Asian stock markets were mixed on Thursday as investors were waiting for the announcement on the next Federal Reserve leader, shrugging off results of a Fed meeting that met their expectations. Some markets were pressured by investors locking in profit from recent gains.  KEEPING SCORE: Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 added 0.2 percent to 22,458.30 while South Korea’s Kospi fell 0.2 percent to 2,551.94 as investors took a breather from the latest streak of winning. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index inched up 0.1 percent to 28,620.16. Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.3 percent to 3,384.15. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 was flat at 5,939.40. Stocks in Singapore were lower but elsewhere in Southeast Asia, they were higher.  ANALYST’S TAKE: “Market participants are waiting for the nomination of the next Fed chair to assess future monetary policy shifts,” said Margaret Yang Yan, a market analyst at CMC Markets in Singapore. “Current Fed governor Jerome Power is believed to be the most promising candidate, who will likely bring certainty and consistency to the rate hike path.”  FED WATCH: The Federal Reserve kept its interest rates steady at their low levels as widely expected and upgraded their views on the U.S. economy saying that the world’s largest economy is rising “at a solid rate,” a term stronger than “moderate” rate used in September. The phrase strengthened the views that the Fed was due to hike interest rates in December. President Donald Trump is expected to name the successor to Fed Chair Janet Yellen later in the day.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)  WASHINGTON (AP) — A trove of Facebook ads made public Wednesday by Congress depicts Russia’s extraordinary cyber intrusion into American life in 2016 aimed at upending the nation’s democratic debate and fomenting discord over such disparate issues as immigration, gun control and politics.  The ads, seen by vast numbers of people, encouraged street demonstrations against Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and fostered support and opposition to Bernie Sanders, Muslims, gays, blacks and the icons of the Civil Rights movement.  The few dozen ads, a small sampling of the roughly 3,000 Russia-connected ones that Facebook has identified and turned over to Congress, were released amid two consecutive days of tough and sometimes caustic questioning by House and Senate lawmakers about why social media giants hadn’t done more to combat Russian interference on their sites.  The ads underscore how foreign agents sought to sow confusion, anger and discord among Americans through messages on hot-button topics. U.S. intelligence services say the Russian use of social media was part of a broad effort to sway the 2016 presidential election in favor of Trump. Special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating whether the Kremlin worked with the Trump campaign to influence voters.  Congresssional lawmakers released a trove of Facebook ads on Wednesday linked to a Russian effort to disrupt the American political process and whip up tensions around sensitive social issues. (Nov. 1)  Many of the ads show careful targeting, with messages geared toward particular audiences. One ad, aimed at those with an interest in civil rights and their leaders, highlights a man who claims to be Bill Clinton’s illegitimate son. Another video parodying Trump was targeted at blacks who also are interested in BlackNews.com, HuffPost Politics or HuffPost Black Voices.  Though officials at Facebook and other social media giants were initially reluctant to acknowledge Russian success on their sites in swaying popular opinion, company leaders have struck a different tone in recent weeks and disclosed steps to Congress they say are intended to prevent future meddling by foreign agents.  In preparation for hearings this week, Facebook disclosed that content generated by a Russian group, the Internet Research Agency, potentially reached as many as 126 million users. Company executives said that going forward they would verify political ad buyers in federal elections, requiring them to reveal correct names and locations. The site will also create new graphics where users can click on the ads and find out more about who’s behind them.  But that did not prevent hours of questioning during two days of hearings, with lawmakers expressing exasperation at the seeming inability to thwart foreign intervention.  At one point during a hearing Tuesday, Sen. Al Franken shook his head after he couldn’t get all the companies to commit to not accepting political ads bought with foreign currency. Several ads touting Facebook pages called “Back the Badge,” ″Being Patriotic,” ″Blacktivist,” ″South United” and “Woke Blacks” were labeled as being paid for in rubles using Qiwi, a Moscow-based payment provider that aims to serve “the new generation in Russia” and former Soviet republics, according to the company’s website.  “Google has all knowledge that man has ever developed,” the Minnesota Democrat said. “You can’t put together rubles with a political ad and go like, ‘Hmmm, those data points spell out something pretty bad?’ ”  Besides the ads released by lawmakers on the House intelligence committee, Democrats on the panel also released four tweets from RT, a Russian state-sponsored television network, and more than 2,700 Twitter handles active during the final months of the election campaign.  Taken together, they show how actual news events and stories helped shape surreptitious Russian messaging.  One advertisement cited a real October 2016 news story — about a gunman’s battle with Boston police officers — then used it to attack Hillary Clinton as “the main hardliner against cops” and to promote Trump as the candidate who can “defend the police from terrorists.”  Three of the tweets referenced Clinton, including one that linked to an RT story about the release of a batch of hacked emails from her campaign chairman, John Podesta. Another featured a video of Clinton falling while getting into a van. “What impact will this stumble have on #Hillary’s campaign?” it read.  Some 34,000 Trump supporters were shown an ad calling for Clinton’s removal from the ballot, citing “dynastic succession of the Clinton family” as a breach of core principles laid out by the Founding Fathers. Clicking on it took Facebook users to a petition at WhiteHouse.gov. Another, seen by more than 15,000 people and getting some 1,300 clicks, equated Clinton with President Barack Obama’s “anti-police and anti-constitutional propaganda.”  Though U.S. intelligence officials believe the social media effort was aimed at aiding Trump, there are other indications it was intended to sow general divisions.  One ad promoted a Nov. 12 anti-Trump rally in New York City, titled “Not My President.” Large anti-Trump rallies actually did take place around the country that day in major American cities. That doesn’t mean the Russian accounts planned the events, but rather that they were piggybacking on existing protests and promoting them to like-minded people.  Lawmakers said some Russia-linked ads, including one from an account purporting to be linked to the Tennessee Republican Party, were shared not only by ordinary Americans, but by members of the Trump campaign and administration, including Trump’s son Donald Jr. and White House counselor Kellyanne Conway.  Not all of Russia’s activity was intended to intervene in the election, said Salve Regina University professor James Ludes, who has written on Russia’s influence on the United States.  The ads on divisive issues such as race and gun ownership — or even organizing opposing rallies across the street from each other — are meant to “attack political cohesion” and make Americans turn against one another, he said.  “It’s not intended to benefit once candidate or another per se, but raise political temperature,” Ludes said. “Make us feel like we are coming apart at the seams.”  ___  Associated Press writers Chad Day in Alexandria, Virginia, Ryan Nakashima in Menlo Park, California, Barbara Ortutay in New York and Matt O’Brien in Cambridge, Massachusetts contributed to this report.",3.0813953488372094,43,"[5.0, 5.0, 2.0, 5.0, 3.0, 4.5, 2.5, 4.5, 4.5, 1.5, 5.0, 3.5, 0.5, 4.0, 3.0, 1.5, 4.5, 5.0, 2.5, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0, 4.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 2.0, 0.5, 4.0, 2.5, 1.5, 5.0, 5.0, 3.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5]"

(AP Photo/Noah Berger, File)  NEW YORK (AP) — Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Wednesday that the company is serious about preventing abuse and that its investments in keeping “problematic content” off its social network will affect its profitability.  “Protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits,” Zuckerberg said in a statement.  Facebook, meanwhile, reported that its third-quarter profit soared 79 percent to $4.71 billion.  The company’s top lawyer has spent the past two days testifying to Congress alongside executives from Twitter and Google about Russia-linked accounts’ manipulation of their platforms. Lawmakers criticized Facebook for not doing more to stop Russians from interfering in American political discourse.  Facebook has said that content from a Russian troll farm, the Internet Research Agency, potentially reached as many as 126 million users.  Zuckerberg acknowledged the problem Wednesday.  The company’s growth doesn’t matter “if our services are used in a way that doesn’t bring people closer together or if the foundation of our society is undermined by foreign interference,” he said on a call with investors to discuss Facebook’s quarterly earnings report. “I’ve expressed how upset I am that the Russians tried to use our tools to sow mistrust.”  He said Facebook is working to strengthen the security of its social-media platform that “goes beyond elections.” Changes are focused on preventing abuse and harmful content, removing fake news, hate speech and other “problematic content,” he said. That’s good for business, he said, since Facebook users don’t want fake news, hate speech or bullying.  Facebook says that 10,000 people work on safety and security today, and it will double those teams by the end of next year. These workers won’t all be full-time at Facebook and will include contractors.  Facebook Inc. said its third-quarter net income was $1.59 per share, topping expectations. The average estimate of 19 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $1.29 per share.  The Menlo Park, California, company’s revenue grew 47 percent to $10.33 billion. Wall Street predicted $9.88 billion.  Facebook continued racking up users. Monthly users rose 16 percent to 2.07 billion. Daily users also climbed 16 percent to 1.37 billion.  Revenue from mobile ads made up 88 percent of total ad revenue, up from 84 percent a year ago.  The company says it’s getting better at targeting ads at its users and that’s helped push up how much it charges for ads.  Facebook shares dropped 1.3 percent to $180.30 in after-hours trading.

1336,2935,11,3,2017,2017-11-03,Associated Press News,Female lawmakers allege harassment by colleagues in House," For years, Republican Rep. Mary Bono endured increasingly suggestive comments from a fellow lawmaker in the House of Representatives. But when the congressman approached her on the House floor and told her he’d been thinking about her in the shower, she’d had enough.  She confronted the man, who she said still serves in Congress, telling him his comments were demeaning and wrong. And he backed off.  Bono, who served 15 years before being defeated in 2012, is not alone.  As reports pile up of harassment or worse by men in entertainment, business and the media, one current and three former female lawmakers tell The Associated Press that they, too, have been harassed or subjected to hostile sexual comments — by fellow members of Congress.  Their stories, published Friday by The AP, renewed calls to tighten up Congress’ own lax training and reporting requirements. House Speaker Paul Ryan sent a memo to fellow lawmakers encouraging them to complete sexual harassment training and mandate it for their staffs, telling them, “Harassment has no place in this institution. ... We can and should lead by example.”  The example set by male members of Congress has not always been admirable, as the accounts from the four female lawmakers who spoke with The AP make clear.  The incidents they recounted occurred years or even decades ago, usually when the women were young newcomers to Congress. They range from isolated comments at one hearing, to repeated unwanted come-ons, to lewd remarks and even groping on the House floor. Coming amid an intensifying national focus on sexual harassment and gender hostility in the workplace, the revelations underscore that no woman is immune, even at the highest reaches of government.  “This is about power,” said Democratic former California Sen. Barbara Boxer, after describing an incident at a hearing in the 1980s where a male colleague made a sexually suggestive comment about her from the dais, which was met with general laughter and an approving second from the committee chairman.  “That was an example of the way I think we were thought of, a lot of us. ... It’s hostile and embarrasses, and therefore could take away a person’s power,” she said.  Bono, Boxer and the other female lawmakers spoke on the record to tell their stories in the wake of revelations about Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein’s serial attacks on women, as well as disclosures from current and former Capitol Hill staffers about harassment by lawmakers and aides.  Largely untold before now is that some female lawmakers themselves say they have been harassed by male colleagues. While rare, the accounts raise troubling questions about the boys’ club environment in Congress where male lawmakers can feel empowered to target not only staffers but even their own peers.  The lawmakers declined to identify the perpetrators by name, but they said at least two of the men continue to serve in the House. None of the female lawmakers interviewed reported what happened, and some noted it was not clear where they would lodge such a complaint. At least three of the four told friends or aides about the incidents, which in some cases were witnessed by other lawmakers.  “When I was a very new member of Congress in my early 30s, there was a more senior member who outright propositioned me, who was married, and despite trying to laugh it off and brush it aside it, would repeat. And I would avoid that member,” said Rep. Linda Sanchez, D-Calif. She added that she would warn other new female members about the lawmaker in question, but she declined to identify him, while saying he remains in Congress.  “I just don’t think it would be helpful” to call the lawmaker out by name, Sanchez said. “The problem is, as a member there’s no HR department you can go to, there’s nobody you can turn to. Ultimately they’re employed by their constituents.”  Sanchez also said that a different male colleague repeatedly ogled her, and at one point touched her inappropriately on the House floor, while trying to make it appear accidental. She declined to identify the lawmaker but said he was no longer in Congress.  Bono, who arrived in the House at age 36 to replace her husband Sonny Bono after he died in a skiing accident, said she ultimately confronted her colleague on the House floor after he’d made repeated harassing comments.  She said it seemed like the lawmaker didn’t know how to talk to a woman as an equal. “Instead of being, ‘How’s the weather, how’s your career, how’s your bill,’ it was, ‘I thought about you while I was in the shower.’ So it was a matter of saying to him, ‘That’s not cool, that’s just not cool.’”  Bono declined to identify the lawmaker, saying the behavior stopped after she finally challenged him. He still serves in Congress, she said.  “It is a man’s world, it’s still a man’s world,” Bono said. “Not being a flirt and not being a bitch. That was my rule, to try to walk that fine line.”  Former Rep. Hilda Solis, now a Los Angeles County supervisor, recalls repeated unwanted harassing overtures from one lawmaker, though she declined to name him or go into detail.  “I don’t think I’m the only one. What I tried to do was ignore it, turn away, walk away. Obviously it’s offensive. Are you supposed to be flattered? No, we’re adults. Not appropriate,” said Solis, who left Congress in 2009 to join the Obama administration as labor secretary.  “It’s humiliating, even though they may have thought they were being cute. No, it’s not. It’s not appropriate. I’m your colleague, but he doesn’t see me that way, and that’s a problem,” Solis said.  The experiences occurred against the backdrop of broader gender inequities in Congress, where women remain a distinct minority, making up only about 20 percent of members in the House and Senate. That’s up from fewer than 10 percent in the quarter-century since politics’ Year of the Woman in 1992. That election season, large numbers of women sought office following hearings by the then-all-male Senate Judiciary Committee over Anita Hill’s testimony about alleged sexual harassment by Clarence Thomas, who was subsequently confirmed to the Supreme Court.  The increase in numbers and the prominence of a few individual women, such as House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, has not resulted in parity in all measures, nor eliminated the potential for male members to demean or even harass their female counterparts. Nonetheless, a few female lawmakers contacted by the AP expressed surprise and even disbelief at the notion that lawmakers themselves could be victims of harassment.  Democratic Rep. Jackie Speier of California has recently gone public with an account of being sexually assaulted by a male chief of staff while she was a congressional staffer. She has criticized the vague rules in place on the issue and has introduced legislation aimed at increasing protections for congressional employees. In a video posted to Twitter last week, she called Congress “a breeding ground for a hostile work environment” and encouraged others to come forward.  Yet when it comes to lawmakers themselves, Speier said: “I think the women in Congress are big girls. The equalizer that exists in Congress that doesn’t exist in other settings is that we all get paid the same amount and we all have a vote, the same vote. So if you have members that are demeaning you it’s because you’re letting them.”  Democratic former Rep. Ellen Tauscher of California argued that although male lawmakers “can be jackasses ... I don’t believe members of Congress can sexually harass each other, which is a legal term of art, because we are equals in our work.”  In fact, the law specifies that harassment can occur between equals, said Jennifer Drobac, a professor at the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law, who teaches a course in sexual harassment law.  “Formally, two members of Congress may have the same status. That doesn’t change the fact that sexual harassment can occur between peers,” Drobac said, noting that numerous other factors can come into play, including the difference in age and length of service between the members, and the mere fact that men have more power in society than women.  Yet the fact that some dispute whether harassment could even occur between members of Congress underscores the complexity of the issue and the fraught questions surrounding it.  Bono said she found power in confronting her harasser, and that after she did so it never happened again. She emphasized that she encountered only a couple out-of-line colleagues during her time in the House, and said that she understood her experience was different than those of young staffers who may face harassment from someone who could retaliate against them.  But Bono strongly disputed any suggestion that she or any other female lawmaker could not be harassed by their peers.  “My career didn’t suffer, I didn’t suffer,” Bono said. “But it did happen.”  ___  Follow Erica Werner on Twitter @ericawerner and Juliet Linderman @julietlinderman",3.477272727272727,22,"[5.0, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 0.5, 1.5, 4.5, 4.0, 0.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.0, 2.5, 3.5, 4.0, 2.0, 2.5]"

Kevin Brady, R-Texas, watch. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)  WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on the tax overhaul from House Republicans (all times local):  8:30 p.m.  President Donald Trump is praising the rollout of the GOP’s tax overhaul plan.  In a tweet, Trump writes, “The lobbyists are storming Capital Hill, but Republicans will hold strong and do what is right for America!”  Republican lawmakers introduced the more than 400-page bill earlier Thursday, which would lower the corporate tax rate and simplify the personal code.  Special interest groups in Washington are gearing up to influence the final legislation, which the White House hopes to have passed by the end of the year.  __  6:50 p.m.  A provision in the House Republican tax bill is igniting a battle over abortion.  The measure explicitly lets people designate “unborn children” as beneficiaries of 529 accounts. The language defines them as children “at any stage of development” in the womb.  The accounts are savings programs for future students’ college costs.  Anti-abortion groups are claiming the provision as a victory. March for Life says until now, tax law “has failed to acknowledge the unborn child.”  Abortion-rights advocates say people can already start the investment for future children by initiating it in a parent’s name and transferring the account to their child after it is born.  The Planned Parenthood Action Fund says inscribing the definition of “unborn children” into law is aimed at supporting opponents’ efforts to restrict abortion.  ___  5:20 p.m.  A budget watchdog group has crunched the numbers on the House GOP tax plan and has found that the bulk of the tax cuts go to businesses instead of individuals.  The measure cuts taxes by $1.5 trillion over the coming decade, mixing tax cuts for businesses and individuals with repeal of deductions and other tax breaks.  The Washington-based Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says corporations and other businesses get tax cuts netting out to about $1 trillion over that time while individuals receive net tax cuts totally about $300 billion. People inheriting multimillion-dollar estates would receive $172 billion.  The group complained that some of the provisions are jerry-rigged to lessen their cost in the first 10 years but are likely to be extended at greater cost to the $20 trillion U.S. debt.  ___  3:20 p.m.  President Donald Trump is planting a kiss on a symbol of the House Republican tax plan.  In a White House meeting with House Republican leaders and Republican members of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, the president had an enthusiastic response when he was shown two postcard-sized papers that some taxpayers would be able to use to file their taxes.  The president said, “great job!” and added that he didn’t know he was going to be given a prop. To show his approval, Trump kissed one of the postcards before giving it back to Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady.  Trump is trying to build momentum for the plan ahead of his trip to Asia. He says the bill is about tax cuts, tax reform and “it’s all about jobs.”  ___  2:13 p.m.  President Donald Trump is cheering the Republican Party’s plan to cut the corporate tax rate and efforts to simplify the tax code, and predicts it will earn Democratic votes.  Attending an event with House Speaker Paul Ryan and other lawmakers, Trump says: “This is a middle income tax reduction.”  Trump says many people will be able to file their taxes on a postcard should the plan become law.  Praising the drafters of the GOP tax plan released Thursday, Trump says he’ll be counting on the “great team” to keep up the momentum on tax reform as he embarks on a 12-day trip to Asia Friday.  Trump says he hopes to have the tax reform package signed into law by the end of the year.  ____  1:24 p.m.  Churches would gain the right to endorse political candidates and still retain their tax-free status under a provision in the House GOP’s tax overhaul plan.  The bill would repeal a 63-year-old law credited to former President Lyndon Johnson back when he served in the Senate.  Critics warn it could open a loophole that could funnel tax-free money into campaigns. The provision would cost $2 billion over the coming decade, according to congressional scorekeepers.  The Johnson amendment law prohibits tax-exempt charitable organizations such as churches from participating directly or indirectly in any political campaign to support or oppose a candidate. If the IRS determines that a group has violated the law, it can revoke its tax-exempt status.  The GOP plan permits political activity by churches so long as there is a minimal cost.  ____  12:46 p.m.  President Donald Trump is calling the tax bill released Thursday by Congressional Republicans “a great bill,” expressing optimism that it will be passed into law by the end of the year.  Trump says his administration is “working to give the American people a giant tax cut for Christmas.” Calling tax cuts “a big, beautiful Christmas present.” Says Trump: “It will be the biggest cut in the history of our country. It will also be tax reform, and it will create jobs.”  Trump adds that the Republican proposal, which would slash corporate rates and simplify the personal tax code, has been “met with really a great response.”  ____  12:39 p.m.  The House’s top Democrat and her colleagues from California are using the GOP’s tax cut plan to criticize the 14 Republicans from the state who serve in Congress.  The GOP plan released Thursday limits the deductibility of local property taxes to $10,000, while eliminating the deduction for state income taxes.  Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi says millions of Californians rely on the tax deduction, and limiting it will undermine the financial stability of middle-class families in California.  One by one, Democratic members cited a Republican lawmaker from the state and how many people in their district use the deduction at a Capitol Hill news conference.  Pelosi says “every single California Republican voted for a budget resolution that made it possible for this harm to come to our state, and we want their constituents to know about it.”  ____  12:30 p.m.  The top lobby for small businesses says it opposes the newly-released GOP tax plan — at least in its current form. That’s a big blow to Republicans hoping to quickly pass the measure into law.  The National Federation of Independent Business, a powerful GOP-leaning trade association, says the bill “leaves too many small businesses behind.”  It says too many small businesses currently taxed at individual rates of up to 39.6 percent won’t be able to take advantage of a new 25 percent top tax rate. The GOP measure released on Thursday contains safeguards aimed at making sure the new business tax rate isn’t a huge loophole for high-income wage earners such as lawyers.  The NFIB said that “tax reform should provide substantial relief to all small businesses.”  ____  12:24 p.m.  President Donald Trump has congratulated House Republican leaders for introducing legislation to overhaul the tax code.  But Trump cautions that Thursday’s unveiling marks the beginning of the legislative process and that there is “much work left to do.” The president says special interest groups will distort the facts, lobbyists will try to save their “special deals” and the news media will “unfairly report on our efforts.”  He is pledging a tireless effort by the administration to deliver on his promise to cut taxes for working people.  Trump says tax cuts are the “rocket fuel our economy needs to soar higher than ever before.”  The legislation would slash corporate tax rates and lower taxes for most Americans. It would also limit a cherished deduction for homeowners, among other proposed changes.  ____  11:25 a.m.  House Republicans have released their tax cut plan — and it would slash the corporate tax rate, lowers taxes for most people and limit a cherished deduction for homeowners.  President Donald Trump and the GOP are trying to deliver on the first tax revamp in three decades.  The proposal would add $1.5 trillion to the nation’s debt over the next decade.  Middle-income families would pay less thanks to doubling of the standard deduction and an increase in the child tax credit.  The wealthy would benefit from the repeal of the alternative minimum tax and a phase out of the estate tax.  Some two-income, upper middle class families would pay more after being bumped into a higher tax bracket and losing a valuable deduction on state income taxes.  ___  10:30 a.m.  The House GOP tax plan would require some upper-income taxpayers to pay a higher top rate under a new rate structure.  The result would be to increase the tax burden on those subject to a lower rate under the current system.  Families earning more than $260,000 now have a top rate of 33 percent. They’d get kicked up to the 35 percent bracket. At present, the 35 percent rate starts at $416,700 for married couples.  High-bracket earners, especially in high-tax states, would lose the benefit of deducting state income taxes.  But middle-class earners would benefit. That’s because the bill would nearly double the standard deduction to $24,000 for couples and an increase in the per-child tax credit from $1,000 to $1,600.  And the child credit would be available to households earning up to $230,000, more than double the current income limit. A $300 credit would apply to each parent and non-child dependent.  ___  9:45 a.m.  House Republicans are proposing to place new limits on the tax deduction for mortgage interest in their soon-to-be-released overhaul.  A summary of the plan says it would reduce the cap on the popular deduction to interest on mortgages of $500,000 for newly purchased homes. The current mortgage cap is $1 million.  The idea is sure to generate opposition from the real estate lobby, but it’s being used to help pay for tax cuts elsewhere in the plan.  The plan also limits the deductibility of local property taxes to $10,000 while eliminating the deduction for state income taxes.  The child tax credit would rise from $1,000 to $1,600, though the $4,050 per child exemption would be repealed.  ___  4:30 a.m.  House Republicans are planning major changes to the U.S. tax system while looking to preserve current rules for retirement accounts popular with middle-class Americans and to retain a top income-tax rate for million-dollar earners.  GOP negotiators have worked furiously this week to finalize details of the first major revamp of the tax system in three decades.  Still, they missed a self-imposed Wednesday deadline as leading Republicans batted down rumors that the public rollout could be delayed until next week.

Kevin Brady, R-Texas, right. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)  WASHINGTON (AP) — With fanfare and a White House kickoff, House Republicans unfurled a broad tax-overhaul plan Thursday that would touch virtually all Americans and the economy’s every corner, mingling sharply lower rates for corporations and reduced personal taxes for many with fewer deductions for home-buyers and families with steep medical bills.  The measure, which would be the most extensive rewrite of the nation’s tax code in three decades, is the product of a party that faces increasing pressure to produce a marquee legislative victory of some sort before next year’s elections. GOP leaders touted the plan as a sparkplug for the economy and a boon to the middle class and christened it the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  “We are working to give the American people a giant tax cut for Christmas,” President Donald Trump said in the Oval Office. The measure, he said, “will also be tax reform, and it will create jobs.”  It would also increase the national debt, a problem for some Republicans. And Democrats attacked the proposal as the GOP’s latest bonanza for the rich, with a phase-out of the inheritance tax and repeal of the alternative minimum tax on the highest earners — certain to help Trump and members of his family and Cabinet, among others.  House Republicans unveiled a sweeping tax reform bill on Wednesday that promises to cut taxes and simplify the tax code, but also cuts some popular deductions and credits. (Nov. 2)  “If you’re the wealthiest 1 percent, Republicans will give you the sun, the moon and the stars, all of that at the expense of the great middle class,” said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.  And there was enough discontent among Republicans and business groups to leave the legislation’s fate uncertain in a journey through Congress that leaders hope will deposit a landmark bill on Trump’s desk by year’s end.  Underscoring problems ahead, some Republicans from high-tax Northeastern states expressed opposition to the measure’s elimination of the deduction for state and local income taxes. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah called the House measure “a great starting point” but said it would be “somewhat miraculous” if its corporate tax rate reduction to 20 percent — a major Trump goal — survived. His panel plans to produce its own tax package in the coming days.  The House Republicans’ plan, which took them months to craft in countless closed-door meetings, represents the first step in their effort to reverse what’s been a politically disastrous year in Congress. Their drive to obliterate President Barack Obama’s health care law crashed, and GOP lawmakers concede that if the tax measure collapses, their congressional majorities are at risk in next November’s elections.  The package’s tax reductions would outweigh its loophole closers by a massive $1.5 trillion over the coming decade. Many Republicans were willing to add that to the nation’s soaring debt as a price for claiming a resounding tax victory. But it was likely to pose a problem for others — one of several brushfires leaders will need to extinguish to get the measure through Congress.  Republicans must keep their plan’s shortfall from spilling over that $1.5 trillion line or the measure will lose its protection against Democratic Senate filibusters, bill-killing delays that take 60 votes to overcome. There are just 52 GOP senators and unanimous Democratic opposition is likely.  The bill would telescope today’s seven personal income tax brackets into just four: 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent and 39.6 percent.  — The 25 percent rate would start at $45,000 for individuals and $90,000 for married couples.  — The 35 percent rate would apply to family income exceeding $260,000 and individual income over $200,000, which means many upper-income families whose top rate is currently 33 percent would face higher taxes.  — The top rate threshold, now $418,400 for individuals and $470,700 for couples, would rise to $500,000 and $1 million.  The standard deduction — used by people who don’t itemize, around two-thirds of taxpayers — would nearly double to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for couples. That’s expected to encourage even more people to use the standard deduction with a simplified tax form Republicans say will be postcard-sized.  Many middle-income families would pay less, thanks to the bigger standard deduction and an increased child tax credit. Republicans said their plan would save $1,182 in taxes for a family of four earning $59,000, but features like phase-outs of some benefits suggest their taxes could grow in the future.  “The plan clearly chooses corporate CEOs and hedge fund managers over teachers and police officers,” said Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-N.J.  One trade-off for the plan’s reductions was its elimination of breaks that millions have long treasured. Gone would be deductions for people’s medical expenses — especially important for families facing nursing home bills or lacking insurance — and their ability to write off state and local income taxes. The mortgage interest deduction would be limited to the first $500,000 of the loan, down from the current $1 million ceiling.  Led by Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the authors retained the deductibility of up to $10,000 in local property taxes in a bid to line up votes from Republicans from the Northeast. The panel planned to begin votes on the proposal next Monday.  “It’s progress, but I want more,” said Rep. Leonard Lance, R-N.J., who represents one of his state’s wealthier, higher-cost districts and wants the entire property tax deduction restored.  On the business side, the House would drop the top rate for corporations from 35 percent to 20 percent. American companies operating abroad would pay a 10 percent tax on their overseas subsidiaries’ profits. Cash that those firms have amassed abroad but now return home would face a one-time 12 percent tax.  Also reduced to 25 percent would be the rate for many “pass-through” businesses, whose profits are taxed at the owners’ individual rate.  But some of those companies would face higher rates. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said that disparity was “just not acceptable,” and the National Federation of Independent Business said it opposed the bill because it “does not help most small businesses.”  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce praised the measure but said “a lot of work remains to be done.” The group’s chief policy officer, Neil Bradley, said pass-throughs were one concern.  ___  AP reporters Andrew Taylor, Zeke Miller and Kevin Freking in Washington and Mike Catalini in Trenton, New Jersey, contributed.  ___  This story has been corrected to say 52 GOP senators, not 50.",3.5384615384615383,52,"[3.0, 2.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 3.0, 4.0, 0.5, 4.0, 5.0, 2.5, 4.5, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 1.5, 5.0, 4.5, 3.5, 4.0, 3.0, 4.5, 0.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.5, 4.5, 0.5, 5.0, 3.0, 0.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.0, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0, 2.5, 5.0, 4.0, 2.5, 4.5, 3.5, 2.0, 4.5, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0]"
1340,2939,11,2,2017,2017-11-02,Associated Press News,EPA to hold hearing on climate plan repeal in West Virginia," The Trump administration announced Thursday it will hold a public hearing in West Virginia on its plan to nullify an Obama-era plan to limit planet-warming carbon emissions. The state is economically dependent on coal mining.  The Environmental Protection Agency will take comments on its proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan in Charleston, the state capital, on Nov. 28 and 29.  “The EPA is headed to the heart of coal country to hear from those most impacted by the CPP and get their comments on the proposed repeal rule,” said EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. “The agency looks forward to hearing from all interested stakeholders.”  No other public hearings have yet been scheduled. EPA will also accept written comments about the proposed repeal through mid-January.  “We encourage stakeholders to participate, and submit comments online — including any requests for additional public meetings,” said Liz Bowman, an EPA spokeswoman. “As this is a vital issue that affects people across the country, we will do our best to respond to requests for additional meetings.”  Under the Obama administration, EPA held four multiday public hearings — in Washington, Atlanta, Pittsburgh and Denver — to collect feedback before issuing the Clean Power Plan in 2015. About two dozen conservative-leaning states and a battery of fossil-fuel companies immediately sued, successfully preventing the carbon reduction plan from taking effect prior to the election of Donald Trump, who as a candidate pledged to repeal it.  A Republican lawyer who previously served as the attorney general of Oklahoma, Pruitt was among those who fought the Clean Power Plan in court. Since his appointment by Trump to lead EPA, he has made the delay and reversal of recent environmental regulations negatively impacting the profits of coal and petrochemical companies a priority.  Though Trump, Pruitt and others have blamed environmental regulations for the loss of coal-mining jobs, many industry insiders concede that it has been the accelerating shift of electric utilities using cheaper and cleaner-burning natural gas that is the primary culprit.  Pruitt has also sought to cast doubt on the consensus of climate scientists that the continued burning of fossil fuels is the main driver of global warming. Scientists say climate change has already triggered rising seas and more extreme weather, including killer heat waves, worsened droughts and torrential rains.  A Government Accountability Office report released earlier this month concluded that the impacts from climate change are already costing the federal government money, and those costs will likely increase over time.  U.S. taxpayers spent more than $350 billion over the last decade on disaster assistance programs and insurance payouts from floods and crop failures. That tally does not include the massive toll from this year’s wildfires and three major hurricanes, expected to be among the most costly in the nation’s history.  The report predicts these costs will only grow in the future, averaging a budget busting $35 billion each year by 2050 — a figure that recent history would suggest is a conservative estimate.  Bill Price, an organizer for the Sierra Club based in West Virginia, worried that by holding the public hearing where support for both Trump and coal are the strongest, the administration hoped that those opposed to that agenda might be more reticent to speak out.  “There is a concern that the scheduled hearing in West Virginia has all the markings of a sham, that only gives a dying industry a venue to intimidate people,” Price said. “It is our hope that the hearing will provide a safe place where all viewpoints can be heard.”  ___  Register to comment on the EPA’s proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan:  https://www.epa.gov/stationary-sources-air-pollution/electric-utility-generating-units-repealing-clean-power-plan  ___  Follow Associated Press environmental writer Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck",3.2358490566037736,53,"[4.0, 1.5, 4.5, 2.0, 3.0, 3.5, 2.5, 3.0, 3.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0, 1.5, 3.5, 3.0, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 0.5, 5.0, 0.5, 4.0, 4.0, 2.5, 4.5, 2.5, 5.0, 1.5, 4.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 4.5, 3.0, 4.0, 2.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.0, 4.5, 3.5, 4.0, 2.5, 2.0, 1.5, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.0, 4.0]"

Kristi Noem, R-S.D., during a news conference announcing GOP tax legislation, Thursday, Nov. 2, 2017, on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)  WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans have stressed that the tax plan they unveiled Thursday is tailored to benefit America’s middle class. Just how much it would remains uncertain based on the details that have been provided so far.  What is clear is that many of the benefits for the middle class could dwindle over time, even while companies and wealthy individuals could enjoy lasting tax advantages.  The plan promises tax savings next year of $1,182 for a typical household of four with gross income of $59,000, leaving their tax bill at $400.  “We are focused on increasing paychecks in a major way,” said Rep. Kevin Brady, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.  But the proposal’s conflicting provisions and phase-outs of certain benefits suggest that taxes could rise for some middle class earners over time. And for many, the income gains being touted by President Donald Trump are unlikely to materialize.  Some of these complications arise because under the budget instructions, the planned tax cuts can’t increase the national debt by more than $1.5 trillion over the next decade. Anything above $1.5 trillion would force Republicans to amend their plan to generate more revenue — a change that would likely prove difficult.  Trump has frequently said that this would be the biggest tax cut in U.S. history. But outside analyses show that that’s not the case.  The tax plan’s primary beneficiaries would be wealthier Americans, who would enjoy lower tax rates despite the elimination of some breaks, a repeal of the so-called alternative minimum tax and the termination of the estate tax.  “With the details they’ve presented to us so far, it looks like the tax cut benefits the wealthy and major corporations,” said Martin Sullivan, chief economist at Tax Analysts and a former staff economist at the Treasury Department. “In fact, if you have a large family, given the facts that we have now, that you would pay more in taxes.”  Here’s why:  A married couple making less than $90,000 would be taxed at a 12 percent rate, instead of the current 15 percent. The size of their standard deduction would nearly double to $24,000.  But that same couple would lose personal exemptions — deductions that largely benefit families with multiple children. The child tax credit would rise to $1,600 from $1,000 — short of the $2,000 that Sullivan said would be needed to make many families whole.  The tax plan would also repeal the deduction of substantial medical costs, including what families might spend on nursing home care. Nor could people with student loans deduct the interest paid on the debt anymore.  And the plan would cap the deduction of state and local taxes. It also would use a less generous measure of inflation, so that more middle class taxpayers would creep into a higher bracket over several years.  All told, nearly 70 percent of the tax cuts would go to businesses over 10 years, according to an analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The rest of the tax cuts appear to favor the wealthy.  Gary Cohn, the president’s top economic adviser, said Thursday at the Economic Club of Washington that the objective was to help the middle class. But he declined to say whether the wealthy would benefit.  “The hard part about taxes is everyone has got their own unique set of circumstances,” Cohn said.  The plan is already showing some splintering along ideological lines.  The conservative Tax Foundation’s analysis of how different families would fare under the plan suggested that the largest cuts as a percentage of taxes paid would go next year to sample couples earning between $48,000 and $85,000. Even a married couple with two children earning $165,000 would receive a reduction.  But liberal groups stressed the analysis of nonpartisan groups that the benefits would flow largely flow to major companies and the top 1 percent of earners over time as tax breaks such as a new family credit would expire after five years.  “Tax cuts for the well-off are forever,” said Gene Sperling, a former top economic aide in the Obama and Clinton presidencies. “Tax cuts for the middle class are a small, a maybe and some-time thing that can be cut off in their plan.”  The overarching promise made to the middle class by Trump and congressional Republicans is that lower taxes would fuel faster economic growth, which, in turn, would cause incomes to rise. Kevin Hassett, chair of Trump’s White House Council of Economic Advisers, estimates that lowering the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent would lead to an average income gain of $4,000 a year.  But most mainstream economists have disputed that claim. Kent Smetters, faculty director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, estimates that the income growth after a decade would range between $500 to $1,500.  Some tax experts say the tax overhaul might also hurt those who aspire to be middle class. The bottom half of taxpayers now pay no net income tax, according to Treasury Department figures. Many receive refunds via the Earned Income Tax Credit. The plan unveiled Thursday would require eligible taxpayers to provide their Social Security Number to receive this benefit, thereby creating a possible delay in receiving a refund as the IRS enforces this provision.  David Kamin, a former Obama White House official who now teaches law at New York University, said the plan seems to have “no significant help of any kind for about the bottom 35 percent of income earners.”  He added that the proposal could also “run up deficits significantly that would eventually have to be paid for and could threaten programs that do help low and middle income Americans whether that be health care coverage, Social Security, or investments like in infrastructure.”",3.33,100,"[4.5, 1.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.5, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5, 5.0, 1.5, 2.5, 4.5, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 1.0, 4.0, 1.5, 5.0, 5.0, 3.5, 3.0, 5.0, 0.5, 5.0, 4.0, 1.5, 4.5, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.0, 0.5, 2.0, 0.5, 3.0, 4.5, 4.5, 5.0, 1.0, 4.5, 3.5, 1.5, 5.0, 1.0, 4.5, 3.0, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 0.5, 4.0, 1.5, 2.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 5.0, 2.5, 4.5, 5.0, 2.5, 4.0, 3.5, 4.5, 5.0, 0.5, 3.5, 0.5, 2.5, 3.0, 4.5, 2.0, 4.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 5.0, 4.5, 5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 4.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 0.5, 2.0, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5, 1.5, 4.5, 1.5, 0.5, 3.5, 5.0]"

Day by day, the accusations pile up, as scores of women come forward to say they were victims of Weinstein. But others with stories to tell have not. For some of these women who’ve chosen not to go public, the fear of being associated forever with the sordid scandal _ and the effects on their careers, and their lives _ might be too great. Or they may still be struggling with the lingering effects of their encounters. (Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP, File)  LOS ANGELES (AP) — Authorities in Los Angeles and New York said Thursday they had opened new investigations into Harvey Weinstein, the latest in a series of criminal probes into conduct by the disgraced film mogul which has sparked a sexual harassment scandal roiling Hollywood and other industries.  The Manhattan district attorney’s office said a senior prosecutor has been assigned to investigate allegations by “Boardwalk Empire” actress Paz de la Huerta, who told CBS News that Weinstein raped her twice in her apartment in 2010. Spokeswoman Joan Vollero said New York police were also involved, but further details could not be provided.  De la Huerta spoke to CBS News by phone and said the first rape occurred in October 2010 after Weinstein gave her a ride home from a party, insisted on having a drink in her apartment and forced himself on her. She said the second rape occurred in December 2010 after Weinstein came to her apartment; she had been drinking and was not in a condition to give consent, CBS reported the actress said.  Los Angeles police are investigating allegations about Weinstein that occurred in 2015, but spokesman Josh Rubenstein said he could not provide any additional details. The department is also investigating a report by an Italian actress and model who said she was raped by Weinstein in 2013.  Charlotte Triggs, senior editor for People Magazine, discusses the sexual harassment, abuse and assault allegations leveled against some of Hollywood's biggest stars. (Nov. 2)  Weinstein representative Sallie Hofmeister reiterated a statement that Weinstein, 65, denies all allegations of non-consensual sex.  Authorities in Beverly Hills and London are also investigating Weinstein for possible criminal cases.  The investigations came four weeks after The New York Times published an expose of sexual harassment allegations against Weinstein, leading to his firing from the company he co-founded and his expulsion from the producers guild and the organization that bestows the Academy Awards.  The accusations against Weinstein have prompted numerous allegations of sexual harassment and abuse against powerful men in Hollywood and other industries.  CNN reported on Thursday that eight current or former “House of Cards” workers claim that Kevin Spacey made the production a “toxic” workplace and one ex-employee alleges the actor sexually assaulted him.  The workers’ identities were withheld from Thursday’s report because they fear professional fallout, the cable news channel said.  Among them is a former production assistant who alleged that Spacey assaulted him during one of the Netflix show’s early seasons, and CNN reported that all of the people described Spacey’s behavior as predatory.  The report accuses Spacey of allegedly targeting staffers who were typically young and male with nonconsensual touching and crude comments.  Netflix has suspended production on the series, which was slated to end after its sixth season. The streaming service and “House of Cards” producers said Thursday that one allegation against Spacey involved a remark and gesture made during production of the show’s first season in 2012. After, Spacey willingly participated in training and producer Media Rights Capital said it was not aware of any additional complaints against the actor since then.  The production company said it has instituted a hotline for complaints and will investigate them thoroughly. There was no word on the fate of “House of Cards” in Thursday’s statements.  A person with knowledge of the decision said late Thursday that Spacey’s publicist and talent agency CAA have parted ways with the actor. His representatives on Wednesday said the two-time Oscar winner was in treatment for an unspecified condition.  Also on Thursday, actor Corey Feldman appeared on “The Dr. Oz Show” and named the man who he said molested him when he was a young teen.  Feldman made his comments in an interview with series host Mehmet Oz and in an on-air call that Oz identified as being to the Los Angeles Police Department.  Los Angeles Police Department Officer Drake Madison says the department is aware of the show, but no report has yet been filed.  The Associated Press is withholding his name because the man could not be located to comment on Feldman’s allegations.  Feldman, 46, gained fame in the 1980s with films including “Gremlins,” ″The Goonies” and “Stand by Me.”  While the outcome of criminal investigations into allegations against Weinstein remains unclear, the producer may have to give sworn testimony in a lawsuit he filed against his former company.  Attorneys for The Weinstein Co. told a Delaware judge on Thursday that they want to take sworn testimony from the producer, who is suing to gain access to his personnel file and emails.  Weinstein’s seeking the records to defend himself in potential civil and criminal cases, and to help the company respond to a civil rights investigation by New York’s attorney general.  The judge said Weinstein could be deposed, even though his attorney said a deposition would be “tricky” and “fraught with problems,” given the ongoing criminal investigations. The attorney said Weinstein’s ability to testify would be limited without waiving his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination.  ___  AP Television Writer Lynn Elber and Entertainment Writer Anthony McCartney in Los Angeles, AP writer Randall Chase in Dover, Delaware, contributed to this report.",3.3181818181818183,88,"[0.5, 5.0, 3.0, 0.5, 3.5, 2.5, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.0, 1.0, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 2.5, 1.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.0, 5.0, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 2.0, 2.5, 1.5, 4.5, 4.5, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0, 2.5, 4.0, 0.5, 5.0, 5.0, 1.5, 3.5, 4.5, 2.5, 4.0, 4.0, 2.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.0, 0.5, 3.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 1.5, 4.5, 4.5, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 2.5, 1.5, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 2.0, 3.5, 4.0, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 0.5, 3.0, 4.0, 1.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 1.5]"

Scientists have found a previously undiscovered hidden chamber in Egypt's Great Pyramid of Giza, the first such discovery in the structure since the 19th century. In a report published in the journal Nature on Thursday, Nov. 2, 2017, an international team says the 30-meter (yard) void deep within the pyramid is situated above the Grand Gallery, and has a similar cross-section. (AP Photo/Hassan Ammar, File)  CAIRO (AP) — Scientists say they have found a hidden chamber in Egypt’s Great Pyramid of Giza, in what would be the first such discovery in the structure since the 19th century and one likely to spark a new surge of interest in the pharaohs.  In an article published in the journal Nature on Thursday, an international team said the 30-meter (yard) void deep within the pyramid is situated above the structure’s Grand Gallery, and has a similar cross-section.  The purpose of the space is unclear, and it’s not yet known whether it was built with a function in mind or if it’s merely a gap in the pyramid’s architecture. Some experts say such empty spaces have been known for years.  “This is a premier,” said Mehdi Tayoubi, a co-founder of the ScanPyramids project and president of the Heritage Innovation Preservation Institute. “It could be composed of one or several structures... maybe it could be another Grand Gallery. It could be a chamber, it could be a lot of things.”  The scientists made the discovery using cosmic-ray imaging, recording the behavior of subatomic particles called muons that penetrate the rock similar to X-rays, only much deeper. Their paper was peer-reviewed before appearing in Nature, an international, interdisciplinary journal of science, and its results confirmed by other teams of scientists.  Chances of the space containing treasure or burial chambers are almost nil, said Aidan Dodson, an Egyptologist at the University of Bristol, but the discovery helps shed light on building techniques.  “The pyramid’s burial chamber and sarcophagus have already been discovered, so this new area was more likely kept empty above the Grand Gallery to reduce the weight of stone pressing down on its ceiling,” he said, adding that similar designs have been found in other pyramids.  Egypt’s former antiquities minister and famed archaeologist Zahi Hawass, who has been testing scanning methods and heads the government’s oversight panel for the new techniques, said that the area in question has been known of for years and thus does not constitute a discovery. He has long downplayed the usefulness of scans of ancient sites.  “The Great Pyramid is full of voids. We have to be careful how results are presented to the public,” he said, adding that one problem facing the international team is that it did not have an Egyptologist as a member. He said the chamber was likely empty space builders used to construct the rooms below.  “In order to construct the Grand Gallery, you had to have a hollow, or a big void in order to access it — you cannot build it without such a space,” he said. “Large voids exist between the stones and may have been left as construction gaps.”  The pyramid is also known as Khufu’s Pyramid for its builder, a 4th Dynasty pharaoh who reigned from 2509 to 2483 B.C. Visitors to the pyramid, on the outskirts of Cairo, can walk, hunched over, up a long tunnel to reach the Grand Gallery. The space announced by the scanning team does not appear to be connected to any known internal passages.  Scientists involved in the scanning called the find a “breakthrough” that highlighted the usefulness of modern particle physics in archaeology.  “It was hidden, I think, since the construction of the pyramid,” Tayoubi added.  The Great Pyramid, the last surviving wonder of the ancient world, has captivated visitors since it was built as a royal burial chamber some 4,500 years ago. Experts are still divided over how it and other pyramids were constructed, so even relatively minor discoveries generate great interest.  Late last year, for example, thermal scanning identified a major anomaly in the Great Pyramid — three adjacent stones at its base which registered higher temperatures than others.  Speculation that King Tutankhamun’s tomb contains additional antechambers stoked interest in recent years, before scans by ground-penetrating radar and other tools came up empty, raising doubts about the claim.  The muon scan is accomplished by planting special plates inside and around the pyramid to collect data on the particles, which rain down from the earth’s atmosphere. They pass through empty spaces but can be absorbed or deflected by harder surfaces, allowing scientists to study their trajectories and discern what is stone and what is not. Several plates were used to triangulate the void discovered in the Great Pyramid.  While the technology can detect large open spaces, it cannot discern what is inside, so it’s unclear if the empty space contains any objects. Tayoubi said the team plans now to work with others to come up with hypotheses about the area.  “The good news is that the void is there, and it’s very big,” he said.  ___  Follow Brian Rohan on Twitter at: www.twitter.com/brian_rohan",3.9166666666666665,12,"[4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 4.5]"

(Nils Ribi Photography via AP)  BOISE, Idaho (AP) — The stars are aligning for Idaho — mainly because they’re visible.  The International Dark-Sky Association this week named the central Idaho city of Ketchum an International Dark Sky Community, only the 16th in the world, after years of efforts to limit excess artificial light. It comes as bigger parts of the state received or are seeking rare dark-sky designations that can attract stargazers and boost home values.  Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve in south-central Idaho, a prime destination for astronomy buffs, became an International Dark Sky Park earlier this year, one of about 40 in the United States.  And the rarest prize of all could come in December when the association decides whether to designate 1,400 square miles (3,600 square kilometers) in central Idaho an International Dark Sky Reserve. It would be the first in the nation.  Idaho is “becoming one of the centers of interest in dark skies in the country,” said John Barentine, program manager at the Tucson, Arizona-based International Dark-Sky Association.  Much of Ketchum’s economy runs on tourism, and the designations could bring in additional visitors. Thousands descended on the mountain resort town for last summer’s total solar eclipse, and it’s sandwiched between the ritzy Sun Valley to the east and Sun Valley Resort’s ski area on Bald Mountain to the west, which draws tourists from across the globe.  The town’s designation is due to the “work of so many who have devoted time and energy to reducing light pollution across our city and neighborhoods so that we can enjoy the truly amazing views we have of the night sky,” Mayor Nina Jones said in a statement.  Ketchum, with some of the highest home prices in Idaho, is the first city in the state to be named a Dark Sky Community. The association started making such designations in 2001, which also include Sedona, Arizona; Beverly Shores, Indiana; and Moffat, Scotland.  Dark-sky measures have drawn opposition in the U.S. from the outdoor advertising industry and those against additional government regulations.  The Ketchum designation could help as the International Dark-Sky Association considers a 127-page application for the reserve in Idaho. Barentine said the group looks at what surrounding communities are doing to protect the dark core area of the reserve.  “It’s more like a restoration effort in the communities, and it’s more of a preservation effort in the parks and reserves,” he said.  Barentine said Craters of the Moon monument is too far away from the proposed reserve to be a factor in the decision, expected in mid-December.",4.045454545454546,11,"[4.5, 3.0, 5.0, 3.5, 4.0, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 5.0, 4.0]"

Scientists are claiming an isolated and tiny population of orangutans on the Indonesian island of Sumatra with frizzier hair and smaller heads are a new species of great ape. It's believed that there are no more than 800 of the primates that researchers named Pongo tapanuliensis, making it the most endangered great ape species. (James Askew/Sumatran Orangutan Conservation Programme via AP)  JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — A remote population of frizzy-haired orangutans on the Indonesian island of Sumatra seems to be a new species of primate, scientists say.  But the purportedly newest member of the family tree of advanced animals that include humans may not be around much longer. Their numbers are so small, and their habitat so fragmented, that they are in danger of going extinct, say the scientists who studied them.  A study published Thursday in the journal Current Biology said there are no more than 800 of the primates, which researchers named Pongo tapanuliensis, making it the most endangered great ape species.  The researchers say the population is highly vulnerable and its habitat is facing further pressure from development.  “If steps are not taken quickly to reduce current and future threats to conserve every last remaining bit of forest we may see the discovery and extinction of a great ape species within our lifetime,” they said.  It’s the first great ape species to be described by scientists in nearly 90 years. Previously, science has recognized six great ape species: Sumatran and Bornean orangutans, eastern and western gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos. Some scientists also classify humans as great apes but others argue for a separate categorization.  The research is based on analysis of the skeleton of an adult male killed in a conflict with villagers, a genetic study indicating the population’s evolutionary split from other orangutans occurred about 3.4 million years ago, and analysis since 2006 of behavioral and habitat differences.  The primates are confined to a range of about 1,100 square kilometers (425 square miles) in the Batang Toru forest in the Tapanuli districts of Northern Sumatra. Historically, the population had low levels of interbreeding with Sumatran orangutans further north but that completely ceased 10,000 to 20,000 years ago, according to the genetic study.  Aside from genetic evidence and the physical differences that include frizzier hair and a smaller head, other unique characteristics include diet, restriction of habitat to upland areas and the male’s long call.  There is no standardized international system for recognition of new species, but to be taken seriously a discovery requires at least publication in a credible peer-reviewed scientific journal.  Primatologist Russell Mittermeier, head of the primate specialist group at the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, called the finding a “remarkable discovery” that puts the onus on the Indonesian government to ensure the species survives.  Mittermeier, who was not one of the 37 authors of the study, said he was “very excited” by the research.  Last year, the IUCN classified Bornean orangutans as critically endangered due to a precipitous population decline caused by destruction of their forest habitat for palm oil and pulp wood plantations. Sumatran orangutans have been classified as critically endangered since 2008.  Matthew Nowak, one of the study’s authors, said the Tapanuli orangutans live in three pockets of forest that are separated by non-protected areas.  “For the species to be viable into the future, those three fragments need to be reconnected via forest corridors,” he said.  Additionally, the authors are recommending that development plans for the region including a hydropower plant be stopped by the government.  “It is imperative that all remaining forest be protected and that a local management body works to ensure the protection of the Batang Toru ecosystem,” Novak said.  Wiratno, the director general of conservation of natural resources and ecosystems at Indonesia’s Forestry and Environment Ministry, told a news conference in Jakarta that most of Batang Toru forest was designated as protected in December 2015.  He said its management will be a priority and is a “great challenge.”  “We are deeply committed to maintaining the survival of this species,” said Wiratno, who uses one name.  The Batang Toru orangutan population was found during a field survey by researcher Erik Meijaard in 1997 and a research station was established in the area in 2006.  It was not until 2013, when the adult male skeleton became available, that scientists realized how unique the population was, which sparked the largest genomic study of wild orangutans ever carried out to provide further evidence of a third orangutan species.  ___  Wright reported from Bangkok.",4.125,12,"[5.0, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 4.0, 4.5, 4.5, 3.0, 4.0, 4.5]"

(AP Photo/Chuck Zoeller, File)  NEW YORK (AP) — More than 100 employees of The Associated Press petitioned the company’s management on Friday, asking if any sexual harassment complaints had been made against former news executive Michael Oreskes while he was employed there.  Oreskes, who worked at the AP from 2008 to 2015, was ousted this week as newsroom chief of National Public Radio following reports of improprieties when he worked at The New York Times in the 1990s and later at NPR. The AP has not said whether anyone has complained about Oreskes at the news agency. Jessica Bruce, senior vice president, said there have been “no written agreements, payments or settlements of any kind” made with anyone in connection with his behavior.  The request by 116 members of the News Media Guild came as the AP’s executive editor, Sally Buzbee, emailed a letter to staff members worldwide reminding them of steps they could take if they felt harassed or intimidated.  Meanwhile, NPR’s president and CEO, Jarl Mohn, held a meeting with the radio network’s employees on Friday to discuss the case. Mohn apologized, telling them he should have taken quicker action.  Oreskes was caught up in the flood of reports about bad behavior following revelations of alleged sexual assault by Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein. The veteran news executive resigned from NPR at Mohn’s request Wednesday following a Washington Post story about two women who said he suddenly kissed them while they were discussing job prospects in the 1990s. Oreskes was then Washington bureau chief at The New York Times. Since the initial Washington Post story about the accusations, two female NPR employees’ complaints have come to light about times when he had made them feel uncomfortable.  The NPR meeting was preceded by a note from Mohn to his staff stating that the company had hired an outside law firm to review its handling of complaints about Oreskes.  “I let you down,” Mohn said. “I should have acted faster and more decisively.”  Oreskes, in resigning, said he was deeply sorry to those whom he hurt and that his behavior was wrong and inexcusable.  While complaints about Oreskes’ behavior at The Times and NPR have been publicized, nothing has emerged about his tenure at the AP. The company said it refrains from commenting about personnel matters, and Bruce said this was particularly important considering Buzbee had just sent a letter to employees promising confidentiality if they made complaints.  Buzbee, who has circulated throughout the AP’s New York headquarters this week speaking informally to employees about the company’s policy on harassment, said it was important to send a letter to the AP’s worldwide staff to outline policies and remind them of the company’s confidential “integrity hotline.” The company takes seriously any complaints about conduct and investigates them, “past, present and future,” she said.  Her letter and the union’s petition essentially crossed in the mail Friday. The union asked Buzbee and AP management to publicize the hotline, encourage employees to come forward with information about harassers and provide training at all AP offices. The union also called on the AP to reveal whether any actions had been taken against Oreskes while he worked at the AP, and if any complaints had been lodged against him since he left.  One woman told the union about an incident with Oreskes that made her uncomfortable, but it wasn’t clear whether the person had lodged a formal complaint, said Martha Waggoner, president of the News Media Guild.  “We need assurance that the company has our backs, and if it received complaints, that the company did something about them,” she said.  Buzbee said she encourages staff members to spread her letter to past employees.  “I’m very happy that the guild has come forward about the issue, too,” she said.",2.9838709677419355,31,"[4.0, 2.5, 0.5, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 4.5, 3.0, 2.5, 2.5, 1.5, 5.0, 3.5, 2.5, 0.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.0, 1.5, 4.5, 5.0, 1.0, 3.5, 5.0, 1.0, 3.5, 3.5, 1.5, 3.0, 4.0, 3.5]"

On Wednesday, Nov. 1, 2017, the Federal Reserve releases its latest monetary policy statement after a two-day meeting. ( AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — After she steps down in February, Janet Yellen will go into history books at the first woman to have led the Federal Reserve in its 100-year history. But Yellen, who has earned widespread praise for her stewardship of the Fed, will be remembered for much more than breaking a glass ceiling at the world’s leading central bank.  Here are three areas where Yellen made her mark on the Fed and the U.S. economy:  ___  CRISIS MANAGEMENT  Before becoming the Fed chair in 2014, Yellen served six years as president of the Fed’s San Francisco regional bank and then as vice chair during Ben Bernanke’s second term as Fed chairman from 2010 to 2014. Yellen was among the first Fed officials to recognize the gravity of the risk posed by the subprime mortgage crisis and to grasp the severity of the Great Recession — the worst downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s.  Transcripts of the Fed’s policy meetings during the fall of 2008, when Lehman Brothers’ collapse ignited the scariest phase of the financial crisis and deepened the recession, show that Yellen was a leading advocate for aggressively slashing interest rates to help buttress the financial system and support the economy.  As the recession deepened and millions lost jobs, Yellen was also a vigorous supporter of Bernanke’s drive to take emergency actions that the Fed had never before attempted. With the Fed’s benchmark rate already at a record low near zero, Bernanke, with Yellen’s backing, turned to buying Treasury and mortgage bonds to further drive down long-term borrowing rates. The bond purchases swelled the Fed’s balance sheet five-fold to $4.5 trillion and raised alarms among critics. But the lower rates helped the job market heal and the economy recover.  ___  TRANSITION MANAGEMENT  By the time Yellen took over as Fed chair in February 2014, the recession had ended and the economy had entered its fifth year of expansion. Yet the pace of growth remained anemic. And the job market had yet to recover all of the 9 million jobs that had vanished during the recession.  So Yellen proceeded to guide the Fed to maintain an aggressively stimulative policy, with record-low rates and bond purchases that were intended to hold down long-term loan rates. Some critics, inside and outside the central bank, warned that the Yellen Fed was setting the stage for runaway inflation or dangerous asset bubbles. But Yellen’s approach carried the day. She argued that the frailty of the economy justified maintaining ultra-low borrowing rates.  The Fed kept its benchmark rate near zero until December 2015. Since then, it has raised its rate just four times, each time slightly. In December, economists expect the Fed to raise its benchmark rate again And in October, it began paring its balance sheet with initial small monthly reductions.  Thus far, Yellen’s gamble that the Fed could leave rates at low levels for years longer than some had thought has paid off. The unemployment rate, which peaked at 10 percent in 2009, is now just 4.1 percent — the lowest point since Bill Clinton was president in 2000.  Jerome Powell, the Fed board member whom President Donald Trump tapped to succeed Yellen, is expected to extend Yellen’s policies of gradual modest increases in rates and slight reductions in the Fed’s bond holdings.  ___  HISTORY’S JUDGMENT  Yellen’s belief that rates could stay at record lows because inflation posed no immediate threat has so far proved a winning formula. Inflation, in fact, has stayed chronically too low — below even the Fed’s 2 percent target. And the Fed is forecasting that annual inflation won’t reach 2 percent before 2019.  Some of Yellen’s critics, including conservative Republicans in Congress, remain unbowed. That assert that by refusing to move earlier to normalize Fed rates to shrink the Fed’s bond holdings, Yellen might have elevated the risk of future high inflation or of dangerous bubbles that could form in stocks or other assets. These critics say they fear that a worsening inflation picture might then compel the Fed to raise rates so quickly as to tip the economy into a recession.  Yellen has to hope that future economic trends are kinder to her than they were to one of her predecessors, Alan Greenspan. When he stepped down as Fed chairman in early 2006 after nearly two decades, Greenspan was being hailed as the “maestro” for having skillfully managed the economy.  But by the next year, the first tremors from the subprime mortgage crisis were being felt. And by 2008, the economy was enduring a painful recession and its worst financial crisis in seven decades. Greenspan’s reputation as an astute economic manager suffered a severe blow.  Yellen can, if she chooses, stick around to help shape Fed policies after her term as chair ends on Feb. 3. Her separate term on the seven-member Fed board runs until Jan. 31, 2024. Marriner Eccles, the legendary Fed chairman whose name adorns the central bank’s headquarters building in Washington, is the only chairman to have remained on the board after serving as chairman.  Yellen could broaden her place in history if she became the second person to remain on the Fed’s board after stepping down as its leader. So far, she has been mum about her plans once her term as Fed chair ends.",3.7222222222222223,9,"[5.0, 3.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 0.5, 5.0, 1.5]"

The U.S. government issues the October jobs report, Friday, Nov. 3, 2017. (AP Photo/LM Otero)  WASHINGTON (AP) — With U.S. unemployment at a 17-year low and businesses complaining that they can’t fill jobs, you might expect pay to be rising sharply as companies try to attract or keep workers.  It’s not. The October jobs report showed that pay gains remain sluggish, and the explanations include weak worker productivity and a still-low proportion of adults with jobs. These are long-running trends that still bedevil the economy despite its steady improvement.  Employers added a solid 261,000 jobs last month, the government said Friday, in part because many businesses in Texas and Florida re-opened after having been forced to shut down in September when Hurricanes Harvey and Irma struck.  The unemployment rate reached 4.1 percent, the lowest level in nearly 17 years, from 4.2 percent in September. But the rate dropped for a less-than-encouraging reason: Many people stopped looking for work and so were no longer counted as unemployed.  Still, Friday’s data showed that the hurricanes, for all their fury, hardly knocked the economy or the job market off course. Over the past three months, job growth has averaged 162,000— similar to the pace of hiring before the storms.  “Looking through the volatility from the hurricanes, the U.S. job market is in good shape,” said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial.  Normally, with the unemployment rate ultra-low, businesses are forced to raise pay significantly to fill jobs or to retain existing employees. The last time the jobless rate was this low, in 2000, average hourly pay was surging at a 4 percent annual pace.  Then was then. In October, by contrast, wages crept up just 2.4 percent from a year earlier, the government said Friday. Though that’s double the pace of five years ago, it’s nearly a half-point less than the year-over-year rate in September.  It’s particularly surprising given that some employers say they’re desperate to hire. Mike Bolen, chief executive of McCarthy Building Companies in St. Louis, said he needs more electricians, carpenters, and laborers, as well as engineers, marketing and IT support. McCarthy has 16 offices and employs 4,000.  “We like to say there is no unemployment,” Bolen said. “We have a shortage of everything, everywhere.”  Four years ago, there would be about 30 potential employees in a union hall waiting for job postings, he said. Now, the halls are empty, and there are posted jobs with no takers.  Bolen is working with high schools and community colleges to train and recruit young people. He says he’s raised pay in recent years and offers attractive wages: An entry-level laborer in Denver can start at $16 to $20 an hour and earn up to $30 after one year.  Homebuilders also say they would construct more homes — which could relieve a housing shortage that is depressing sales — if they could find more workers.  Still, the construction industry as a whole isn’t raising pay much: Wages rose just 2.2 percent in October from a year earlier, Friday’s report showed. That’s even lower than the economy-wide average.  Reed Nyffeler, CEO of Signal 88 Security, is similarly frustrated. He says job applications have fallen 90 percent since the recession. The company, which provides security in 200 U.S. markets, needs security officers and professional staff.  “We have franchisees telling me every day they are turning down contracts because they can’t find workers,” Nyffeler said.  Signal 88 has raised starting pay for security officers from $9.25 an hour to $11.25 in the past two years. But other low-wage employers have also lifted pay, Nyffeler said, thereby creating new competition for Signal.  Many potential applicants can’t pass drug tests, Nyffeler says, while others can live off government benefits.  His ability to raise pay, Nyffeler says, is limited because his clients are reluctant to pay more for his company’s services. Signal 88 bills at $17 an hour, on average. The company tries to raise prices each year when it renews contracts, but many of its clients then threaten to seek alternatives.  Other companies appear in similar circumstances: Price increases throughout the economy are weak. Inflation rose just 2.2 percent in September from a year ago and would have been lower without a spike in gas prices.  One way out of the conundrum would be to raise worker efficiency. When workers become more productive — when their output per hour rises — companies can afford to pay more without raising prices.  Yet productivity growth has been weak since the recession ended in 2009. It grew just 1.2 percent a year, on average, in the past decade. That’s less than half the growth rate before the recession. One reason productivity has been so sluggish is that companies haven’t invested much in machinery, technology and other equipment that could boost workers’ output.  The Trump administration and Republican Congress are pushing a steep cut in the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent in hopes of encouraging more productivity-boosting investment. But some economists argue that the increased profits stemming from the tax cut will be used mainly to boost dividends and share buybacks.  Jed Kolko, chief economist at Indeed, the job listing website, notes that the proportion of adults with jobs remains below pre-recession levels. That raises the possibility that there are more Americans available to work than the unemployment rate suggests. It also means that if employers can hire them, they may not feel pressure to raise pay.  Last month, 78.8 percent of adults aged 25 through 54 had jobs. That figure has risen 1.5 percentage points in the past two years. Yet it topped 81 percent in 2000, the last time unemployment was this low.  “By that measure, the labor market is not unusually tight,” Kolko said.",3.5,44,"[3.0, 4.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 1.5, 2.0, 4.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 1.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0, 3.0, 4.5, 5.0, 0.5, 2.5, 5.0, 3.0, 4.5, 4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 2.5, 3.5, 2.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 2.0, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5]"

The UN Climate Change Conference 2017 will take place under Presidency of the Government of Fiji in Bonn, Germany and starts on Monday, Nov. 6, 2017. (AP Photo/Martin Meissner, file)  BERLIN (AP) — Governments, scientists, industry groups and environmental campaigners are meeting in Germany next week to discuss implementing a global agreement to curb climate change, despite uncertainty over how the United States will figure into the effort.  President Donald Trump announced earlier this year that the U.S. will pull out of the 2015 Paris climate accord unless his administration can secure a better deal.  Other countries have pledged to press on regardless at the Nov. 6-17 meeting in the western German city of Bonn. The 23rd Conference of the Parties (COP) will be presided over by Fiji, one of the small island nations particularly vulnerable to the effects of global warming.  Researchers say extreme weather like the events of recent months — including hurricanes in the Caribbean, heatwaves in Europe and flooding in south Asia — are going to become more frequent as a result of climate change. To prevent catastrophic consequences, they say countries must make concerted efforts to shift the global economy away from fossil fuels and to adjust to some inevitable impacts, such as rising sea levels.  “This COP is more important than most people realize,” Andrew Steer, head of the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based environmental think tank, said.  Steer said a growing number of commitments from governments, as well as from major companies and cities around the world was “broadly encouraging.” He noted the falling cost of renewable energy — a key technology required to help power-hungry economies kick the carbon habit.  Most of the 195 countries coming to Bonn — where the U.N. climate agency is located — appear willing to continue hammering out the details needed to make the Paris 2015 accord work, German Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks said ahead of the two-week talks.  Negotiators will try to agree on ways to measure each country’s greenhouse gas emissions and to make sure everyone is playing by the same rules. Since the Paris agreement doesn’t foresee sanctions for countries that fail to meet their targets, peer pressure is the main mechanism for ensuring that governments abide by their commitments and continue to increase their efforts in future.  A key issue will be the transparency of emissions reports, said Nigel Purvis, a former U.S. State Department negotiator under the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush presidencies.  The United States used to be the major force pushing for more open reporting and that will suffer because of the Trump administration’s planned withdrawal from Paris, he said.  “Without U.S. leadership the deal is likely to take a little bit longer and may not be as strong,” said Purvis, president of the group Climate Advisers.  Negotiators have until the end of 2018 to come up with the final rule book; it would be subject to approval at the next climate summit in Katowice, Poland.  Observers say that without the United States driving the talks — as it did in Paris when Barack Obama was in the White House — other leaders will have to fill the gap.  “The United States are not anymore the most important actor in this game of climate change,” Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said.  “The most important actor is China, and India will soon become extremely important, as well as the European Union,” Schellnhuber said.  Some are also placing their hopes in Emmanuel Macron. The French president is expected to fly in on Nov. 15 to show his support during the final phase of the talks. Macron has called for a follow-up meeting in Paris next month.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel, a veteran of past climate summits, will also put in an appearance in Bonn despite being tied up in negotiations to form a new government. The Green Party, with which she hopes to forge a coalition, has urged Merkel to set a firm date for Germany to end the use of coal-fired power plants.

A massive U.S. report released Friday, Nov. 3, 2017, concludes the evidence of global warming is stronger than ever and that more than 90 percent of it has been caused by humans. Since 1900, the reports said Earth has warmed by 1.8 degrees (1 degree Celsius) and seas have risen by 8 inches. (AP Photo/Tom Copeland)  WASHINGTON (AP) — A massive U.S. report concludes the evidence of global warming is stronger than ever, contradicting a favorite talking point of top Trump administration officials, who downplay humans’ role in climate change.  The report released Friday is one of two scientific assessments required every four years. A draft showing how warming affects the U.S. was also published.  Despite fears by some scientists and environmental advocates, David Fahey of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and several authors said there was no political interference or censoring of the 477-page final report.  “A lot of what we’ve been learning over the last four years suggests the possibility that things may have been more serious than we think,” said Robert Kopp of Rutgers University, one of dozens of scientists inside and outside the government who wrote the reports.  Since 1900, Earth has warmed by 1.8 degrees (1 degree Celsius) and seas have risen by 8 inches. Heat waves, downpours and wildfires have become frequent.  Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt have repeatedly said carbon dioxide isn’t the primary contributor to global warming.  It’s “extremely likely” — meaning with 95 to 100 percent certainty — that global warming is man-made, mostly from the spewing of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, scientists concluded.  “Over the last century, there are no convincing alternative explanations,” the report said.  Scientists calculated that human contribution to warming since 1950 is between 92 percent and 123 percent. It’s more than 100 percent on one end, because some natural forces — such as volcanoes and orbital cycle — are working to cool Earth, but are being overwhelmed by the effects of greenhouse gases, said study co-author Katharine Hayhoe of Texas Tech.  “This period is now the warmest in the history of modern civilization,” she said.  For the first time, scientists highlighted a dozen “tipping points” of potential dangers that could happen from warming, things that Hayhoe said “keep me up at night.”  They include the slowing down of the giant Atlantic Ocean circulation system that could dramatically warp weather worldwide, much stronger El Ninos, major decreases in ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, which would spike sea level rise, and massive release of methane and carbon dioxide from thawing permafrost that could turbo-charge warming.  Researchers did not provide an estimate of how likely tipping points would occur, but “there is certainly some chance of some of these things happening,” Fahey said.  The report also documented how different climate change-caused events can interact in a complex way to make life worse such as the California wildfires and Superstorm Sandy five years ago.  The world’s oceans are under a “triple threat” — the water is getting warmer, more acidic and seeing a drop in oxygen levels, Hayhoe said.  In a 1,504-page draft report on the impacts of climate change, scientists detailed dozens of ways global warming is already affecting parts of the U.S.  Scientists said global warming is already sickening, injuring and killing Americans with changes to weather, food, air, water and diseases. And it’s expected to get worse, hurting the economy, wildlife and energy supply.  “Risks range from the inconvenient, such as increasing high tide flooding along the East Coast related to sea level rise, to ... the forced relocation of coastal communities in Alaska and along the Gulf Coast,” the draft report said.  Outside experts said the reports are the most up-to-date summary of climate science.  “It shows that if anything the findings of scientists have become more dire” since 2013, said University of California, Berkeley climate scientist Zeke Hausfather, who wasn’t part of the work.  ___  Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears .

The plan approved Thursday at a meeting of the governing boards of the twin ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach outlines strategies for improving equipment and efficiency to eventually move cargo with zero emissions.  The ports estimate that the cost of the efforts ranges from $7 billion to $14 billion, but the plan does not make clear who will pick up the tab. And detailed plans for implementing each program will require approval by each port’s harbor commission.  “Collaboration will be critical to our success,” Long Beach Harbor Commission President Lou Anne Bynum said in a statement. “Moving the needle to zero requires all of us — the ports, industry, regulatory agencies, environmental groups and our communities — to pool our energy, expertise and resources.”  The plan has raised concerns that the enormous cost of the clean air goals could make the two ports less attractive in the face of competition from ports on the East and Gulf coasts.  The Los Angeles Times reported that Pacific Merchant Shipping Association President John McLaurin told commissioners he fears the cost “and its potential negative impacts on port competitiveness and the one in nine jobs in the Southern California region that are reliant on the ports.”  The neighboring ports 20 miles south of downtown Los Angeles are the single largest fixed source of air pollution in Southern California, according to the South Coast Air Quality Management District.  Main points of the plan include clean-engine milestones for trucks, creating incentives to speed up fleet turnover to near-zero and zero-emission trucks, and efficiency programs for truck reservations and staging yards. The timeline for achieving a zero-emission truck fleet is 2035.  Other elements include requiring terminal operators to use zero-emission equipment by 2020, if possible, or the cleanest available equipment.  The plan also pursues electrification of terminal equipment and expands on-dock rail, with a goal of moving 50 percent of all cargo out of the ports by train.  The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach sprawl over more than 23 square miles (60 square kilometers) of land and water. They handle about 40 percent of U.S. container import traffic, about 25 percent of total exports, and together rank as the ninth-largest port complex in the world, according to the ports.",4.166666666666667,3,"[4.0, 4.0, 4.5]"

Trump begins a five country trip through Asia traveling to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)  JOINT BASE PEARL HARBOR-HICKAM, Hawaii (AP) — President Donald Trump paid a solemn visit to the memorial at Pearl Harbor, a sacred journey for a commander-in-chief about to depart on an Asia trip that will be shadowed by fears of another international conflict.  Trump saluted Friday after entering the USS Arizona memorial following a short boat ride with first lady Melania Trump. They approached a wreath of white flowers — a gift from the couple — and watched as two sailors who stood beside it at attention placed the wreath near a wall of names of the fallen.  The Trumps then tossed white flower petals into the waters above the battleship’s sunken hull, as the president then peered down where the rusted wreckage is visible at the water’s surface.  Nearly 1,200 crew members died on the USS Arizona during the December 7, 1941 surprise attack by Japan that plunged the U.S. into World War II.  Trump, who had spoken earlier in the day about being eager to see the sacred site for the first time, appeared moved by the visit. As the wreath was quietly placed into position, Trump crossed his arms in front of him, closing his eyes as he bowed his head in remembrance.  President Trump is preparing for his first official trip to Asia with North Korea tensions at the fore. AP’s Asia-Pacific News Director previews his visit which includes stops in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. (Nov. 3)  As the sun began to fade over the Pacific, Trump then listened intently to a National Park Service tour guide, stopping briefly at a display that explained how some survivors of the attack, when they die years later, have chosen to be cremated and have their ashes placed in the sunken ship alongside the remains of their fallen colleagues.  Trump said not a word about North Korea or its nuclear ambitions on Friday, the eve of his first official visit to Asia. He will arrive in Japan on Sunday morning, the first of five countries he will visit over 11 days as he exhorts Asian allies to increase pressure on Pyongyang to abandon its deadly ambitions.  Hawaii acted as a sort of midway point on Trump’s trip halfway around the world. He arrived at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam Friday after a daylong flight from Washington.  The president quickly donned a lei after he left Air Force One with his wife, who also wore a wreath of flowers. He signed autographs and gave high-fives to kids who were among a group of civilians and service members that gathered for the arrival.  Trump wasn’t the only attraction to arrive on base. A few in the crowd shouted their admiration for White House chief of staff John Kelly.  “We love you Gen. Kelly,” one person shouted at the retired four-star Marine general who stood several feet behind the president.  Trump was briefed by leaders of the U.S. Pacific Command. The growing threat from North Korea — a crisis that will shadow the entire trip — was expected to be among the topics discussed. Trump was also meeting with the governors of Alaska, Hawaii and Pacific U.S. territories, all potential targets of any successful attempt by North Korea to strike the U.S. with a nuclear-tipped missile.  “We are going to visit very shortly, Pearl Harbor, which I’ve read about, spoken about, heard about, studied, but I haven’t seen. And that is going to be very exciting for me,” Trump said at the start of a briefing with leaders of the U.S. Pacific Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in the region.  The USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor marks the final resting place of more than 1,000 sailors and Marines who were killed on the battleship during the surprise attack on what President Franklin Roosevelt deemed “a date which we live in infamy.” Accessible only by boat, the memorial straddles the ship’s sunken hull.  A total of more than 2,300 sailors, soldiers and Marines died as a result of the attack, as well as 68 civilians, according to the National Park Service.  The visit to the memorial comes soon after Trump was embroiled in a controversy over his attempt to console the grieving families of America’s war dead. The family of one of the four soldiers killed in a Niger ambush last month said the president disrespected them when he called to offer a condolences, a charge Trump vehemently denied.  And The Associated Press discovered that a number of families of soldiers killed since Trump took office had not received a call from the president, despite his claim that he had called nearly all of them.  ___  Associated Press writer Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this report.  ___  Follow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire",3.4285714285714284,7,"[5.0, 4.5, 2.5, 1.5, 4.0, 1.5, 5.0]"

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File)  TOKYO (AP) — President Donald Trump can expect a friendly reception in Japan, his first stop on a five-nation Asia trip that kicks off Sunday.  He and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe largely see eye-to-eye on how to deal with the vexing problem of North Korea’s weapons development, even if a solution remains elusive. America’s trade deficit with Japan could be a point of contention, though Trump has aimed his recent rhetoric on trade at China, not Japan.  The two leaders will meet on the golf course Sunday before holding formal talks on Monday. A look at what’s on tap:  NORTH KOREA  North Korea’s rapid advances in missile development are making the potential threat much more real for both Japan and the United States. As it seeks to send missiles farther, North Korea has test-launched two over northern Japan and into the Pacific Ocean this year. While they were too high to be seen or heard on the ground, the Japanese government set off emergency sirens and warnings advising people to seek shelter. Abe has pushed for stronger U.N. sanctions on North Korea, and joined Trump in saying China should do more to pressure its neighbor. Trump and Abe are likely to agree that what is needed is more pressure, not dialogue, as they have in the past.  ___  TRADE  One of Trump’s first moves as president was to pull the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement that had been signed with 11 other countries after years of tough negotiations. While widely anticipated, it was a blow to Japan and the other TPP members. In line with Trump’s preference for country-to-country trade deals, Vice President Mike Pence and Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Taro Aso have been leading an “economic dialogue” aimed at forging closer ties. Japan’s trade surplus with the U.S. is much smaller than China’s, and Japanese automakers, especially, have sought to mute criticism by setting up shop in the U.S. and hiring American workers. But Trump has complained about a weakening of the yen over the past five years that has aided Japanese exporters and other corporations with significant business overseas.  ___  ABDUCTIONS  Trump’s address to the U.N. General Assembly in September, in which he warned the U.S. might have “to totally destroy North Korea,” got attention in Japan for another reason. “We know it kidnapped a sweet 13-year-old Japanese girl from a beach in her own country to enslave her as a language tutor for North Korea’s spies,” he said. In so doing, Trump touched on an issue that Abe has made a priority to resolve: the Japanese citizens who were abducted by North Korea in the 1970s and 1980s. Five returned in 2002, but the fate of the others remains unclear. Trump plans to meet with the relatives of some of the abductees while he is in Japan.  ___  FORE!  Golf diplomacy has become part of Japan’s playbook on Donald Trump. Abe made a stopover in New York soon after the U.S. presidential election last November and presented the then-president-elect with a pricey Japanese Honma driver. Trump reciprocated with a golf shirt and other golf-related goods. The two hit the links at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida after a summit meeting in Washington in February. They will be joined by top Japanese pro Hideki Matsuyama on Sunday at the Kasumigaseki Country Club outside of Tokyo. The prestigious club changed its policy to allow women to be full members in March after coming under pressure as the venue for golf at the Summer Olympics in Tokyo in 2020.

For years Bono endured the increasingly suggestive comments from a fellow lawmaker in the House. But when the congressman approached her on the House floor and told her he’d been thinking about her in the shower, she’d had enough. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Leading lawmakers are calling for mandatory training and other steps to prevent sexual harassment in Congress as the national spotlight on gender hostility in the workplace falls on Capitol Hill.  The calls from House Speaker Paul Ryan and others follow a series of news reports about women staffers and lawmakers experiencing harassment and sexual advances on the job. The Associated Press reported Friday on the experiences of one current and three former female lawmakers, who said they had fended off unwanted advances, sexual comments and, in one case, physical contact from a male colleague in Congress. The issue was already in the national spotlight because of the sex assault allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein and a growing list of boldface names in entertainment and the media.  On Friday, Ryan sent lawmakers a letter urging them to undergo sexual harassment training and make it mandatory for their staffs.  “Any form of harassment has no place in this institution. Each of us has a responsibility to ensure a workplace that is free from discrimination, harassment, and retaliation,” wrote Ryan, R-Wis. “We can and should lead by example.”  House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi called for passage of Democratic-sponsored legislation that would require anti-harassment training, enhance anti-retaliation protections for staffers who report harassment, and streamline dispute resolution. The recent focus on the issue has made clear that Congress’ tendency to self-police has resulted in lax rules, a patchwork of policies that vary from one office to another, and a complaints clearinghouse lodged in an Office of Compliance that requires a lengthy counseling and mediation period — and that many staffers have not even heard of.  Pelosi said all that needs to change.  “I think we are at a tipping point in our country,” the California Democrat told The Associated Press. “For a long time the Congress was a place where every congressional office had its own rules. ... The system needs to be changed.”  The House Administration Committee, which oversees the operations of the House, also announced plans to convene a hearing Nov. 14 focused on training, policies and mechanisms in place to guard against and report sexual harassment.  In the Senate, New York Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand, who went public several years ago with accounts of inappropriate comments from male senators, also announced legislation on the issue. Gillibrand’s bill would streamline the reporting process within the Office of Compliance, remove the current mediation requirement and give interns the same resources as full-time staff.  “Congress should never be above the law or play by their own set of rules. The current process has little accountability and even less sensitivity to victims of sexual harassment,” Gillibrand said.  GOP Rep. Mary Bono told AP she once confronted a male colleague on the floor of the House after he made repeated suggestive comments, including telling her he’d thought about her in the shower. The behavior stopped, but the lawmaker remains in the House, she said.  Rep. Linda Sanchez described being propositioned repeatedly in years past by one lawmaker who still serves, and ogled and groped by a second who’s since left the House. Former Rep. Hilda Solis disclosed repeated come-ons from a lawmaker, but declined to go into detail, while former Sen. Barbara Boxer described a years-ago incident at a hearing where a lawmaker made a sexually suggestive comment about her from the dais that the committee chairman seconded.  The female lawmakers declined to identify the men they were talking about, and did not report the incidents, with a couple of them noting it was not clear where they would have lodged such a complaint.  On Friday, additional female lawmakers offered public comments on the situations that can result in an environment that is only 20 percent women and still beholden in some ways to out-of-date traditions.  Rep. Cheri Bustos, D-Ill., said she has asked friends and colleagues in the House whether they knew of any woman who had advanced in their careers without being sexually harassed. “Without exception, they don’t know of anybody,” Bustos said. “We are all talking about it because it’s rampant. It’s absolutely rampant.”  As to whether she herself had been harassed by any fellow member, Bustos said: “It depends on how you want to define harassment.”  “How I’ve chosen to handle it is I just sort of dismiss it and I don’t give it another thought,” Bustos said. “I hope what happens out of all of this news coverage is it changes some people’s behavior as far as comments they make, or if it’s worse than that. I hope something good comes out of it.”  ___  Associated Press writers Kevin Freking and Matthew Daly contributed to this report.",3.375,4,"[4.0, 5.0, 1.5, 3.0]"

(AP Photo/Michael Probst,file)  BERLIN (AP) — Climate change is back on the agenda with a global climate conference kicking off Monday in the German city of Bonn.  Who’s coming, what are the key debates about and how green will this meeting be? Five things to know about the U.N. conference known as COP23, which runs from Nov. 6-17.  ____  WHO IS COMING TO BONN?  Up to 25,000 people are expected to attend the talks, which will be presided over by Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama of Fiji — the first time that a small island nation will be at the helm of a major international climate conference. Participants will include diplomats from 195 nations, as well as scientists, lobbyists and environmentalists.  The United States, which has announced its intention to pull out of the landmark Paris climate accord, will be represented by Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Thomas Shannon.  Key countries to watch during the talks are the emerging economic powers China and India. Other nations — Estonia, Peru, Ecuador, Iran, Mali, Ethiopia and the Maldives — will also be in the spotlight for leading major international groupings.  French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other leaders are expected to fly to Bonn toward the end of the summit to give the talks a final push and signal their commitment to fighting climate change.  ___  WHAT ARE THE BIG CLIMATE CHANGE TOPICS NOW?  The 2015 Paris accord set a target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) — or 2 degrees at the most — by the end of the century.  But diplomats didn’t agree on the details of how their nations will reach that ambitious goal. The Bonn talks will flesh out the rule book that countries have to abide by.  This includes coming up with international standards for how to measure carbon emissions, to make sure that one nation’s efforts can be compare to another’s. A second debate centers around how countries take stock of what’s been achieved and set new, more ambitious goals for curbing carbon emissions after 2020.  The third big issue concerns money. Experts agree that shifting economies away from fossil fuels and preparing countries for some of the inevitable consequences of climate change will require vast financial resources — including some from the U.S. administration of President Donald Trump, which is doubtful about man-made climate change.  ___  WHY BONN?  Organizing a massive global conference in Fiji would have strained the Pacific nation’s resources and posed a travel nightmare for thousands of delegates. Germany offered to host the talks in Bonn, the country’s former capital, because it has ample conference space and is already home to the U.N. climate change agency.  Still, they are going to miss the sunshine of Fiji. The weather in Bonn is generally dreary at best in November.  ___  HOW GREEN WILL THE CONFERENCE BE?  Germany says the two-week talks will as environmentally friendly as possible. The country is setting aside part of the 117 million euro ($136.3 million) budget for a fleet of bicycles and electric buses to ferry people between venues.  Each participant will receive a bottle to fill with tap water — a move organizers say will save half a million plastic cups.  Germany’s environment ministry is also investing in renewable energy projects to compensate for the greenhouse gas emissions caused by people from all over the world flying into Bonn for the talks.  ___  AND WHAT ABOUT GERMANY’S COAL USAGE?  Germany likes to portray itself as a leader in the fight against global warming and Merkel’s reputation as the “climate chancellor” is partly built on the pivotal role she played during past negotiations.  But environmentalists note that Germany still gets about 40 percent of its electricity from coal-fired plants — one of the most carbon intensive sources of energy. And German highways are also virtually unique in having no general speed limit, despite the fact that auto emissions rise dramatically at higher speeds.  If prosperous Germany fails to meet its own emissions targets, as current predictions suggest, critics say that would send a bad signal to the rest of the world.",4.083333333333333,6,"[4.5, 4.5, 2.5, 3.0, 5.0, 5.0]"

Schiller, a 1982 graduate of the school, said the institute aims to give scholars from the humanities and the sciences a place to team up on major global problems.  “This is where the best work comes from, as diverse minds with different experiences try to understand a problem together and solve things as a team,” said Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing. “That is where big leaps forward happen.”  Construction is scheduled to begin in spring 2019 at the school’s campus west of Boston. It will add research laboratories, classrooms and space for students and faculty to collaborate across disciplines.  It also will bring a new engineering major to campus as the school seeks an edge in competition with other major universities.  The new facility is Boston College’s latest step in a recent push toward the sciences. Last year, it became one of 115 universities in the U.S. designated as a top research institution by the Carnegie Foundation, which classifies schools based on their research spending and staffing levels, among other factors.  The shift follows in the steps of other private schools that have pursued aggressive expansions into science and research fields, which can add prestige — and a source of revenue— for universities.  Nearby Harvard University is continuing work on a $1 billion science and engineering complex in Boston’s Allston neighborhood after the project was put on hold amid an economic slump in 2010.  North Carolina’s Wake Forest University also introduced a new engineering program this year, blending a science curriculum with the private school’s liberal arts tradition.  At Boston College, officials say the new Schiller institute aims to tackle projects ranging from the development of clean energy to technology that can diagnose and treat humans in poor areas around the world.  The school enrolls about 15,000 students at its campus west of Boston. Last year it had the No. 40 largest endowment among U.S. colleges, valued at nearly $2.1 billion, according to an annual study by the National Association of College and University Business Officers.  School President William Leahy thanked Schiller for the donation on Friday, saying it will “have a profound effect on the university’s ability to address pressing societal needs through advanced scientific research.”  ___  Follow Collin Binkley on Twitter at @cbinkley",5.0,1,[5.0]

Governors of 19 Western states are pressing the federal government to do more to prevent the spread of damage-causing invasive mussels from infected federally managed waterways. (AP Photo/Felicia Fonseca, File)  BOISE, Idaho (AP) — Governors of 19 Western states are pressing the federal government to do more to prevent the spread of damage-causing invasive mussels from infected federally managed waterways.  The Western Governors’ Association on Thursday sent a letter urging Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to put in place by spring 2018 controls to prevent the spread of zebra and quagga mussels.  The governors are also asking that federal agencies conduct mandatory inspections and decontamination of boats leaving infected water bodies. The mussels can attach to boats and trailers and travel long distances, clogging water pipes, damaging boat motors and affecting other aquatic life.  “Given the significant risks that quagga and zebra mussels pose to uninfested waterbodies, it is critical to implement effective control policies in a timely manner,” the letter states.  The governors say they’re particularly concerned about the mussels reaching the Columbia River Basin, Lake Tahoe, and the Colorado River Basin above Lake Powell.  The Interior Department has said that hydroelectric projects infested with the mussels might require an additional $500,000 in annual maintenance. The Pacific Northwest gets much of its power from hydro projects, so an infestation could increase the cost of electricity.  Many states have spent millions and continue to do so to keep the mussels out. Some have set up mandatory checkpoints near borders to intercept boats for inspections, including Idaho, which is spending more than $3 million annually.  “Idaho and our neighbors in the West are acting individually and collaboratively to address the challenge of these invasive species,” Idaho Gov. C.L. “Butch” Otter said in a statement to The Associated Press on Friday. “Now our federal partners must step up to help us stop further infestations.”  Heather Swift, Interior Department spokeswoman, said in an email to The Associated Press on Friday that Zinke hadn’t seen the letter and couldn’t comment specifically.  “Stopping the spread of invasive species is a big concern of the Department and the Secretary,” she said, noting a June 26 news release outlining some of the agency’s collaborative efforts with states and tribal agencies.  The governors’ letter on Thursday is the second they’ve sent this year about invasive mussels to Zinke. A letter sent June 22 also pressed for watercraft inspection and decontamination.  The Interior Department responded Sept. 15 with a two-page letter agreeing with the severity of the problem. The most recent letter by the governors’ included “clarifying questions.”  Specifically, the governors want to know what timeline has been set for the National Park Service to complete an assessment of mussel containment and monitoring programs at Lake Mead National Recreation Area in southeastern Nevada and northwestern Arizona, and the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area in southern Utah and northern Arizona.  The governors are also interested in knowing if similar timelines are being set for other Interior Department agencies, including the Bureau of Land Management and Bureau of Reclamation.  The governors also asked if federal agencies have the authority to require mandatory boat checks and, if not, what authority would be needed.  “Western states need adequate measures to ensure these invaders do not spread to uninfested waters,” the governors said.",3.8181818181818183,11,"[5.0, 2.5, 3.0, 2.5, 4.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 3.0, 4.0, 4.0]"

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)  TOKYO (AP) — The Latest on President Donald Trump’s trip to Asia (all times local):  3:40 p.m.  President Donald Trump and Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe are waxing poetic about their round of golf together.  The two leaders played Sunday with Japanese professional Hideki Matsuyama at a championship golf course outside of Tokyo.  Trump posted a brief video on Twitter. He wrote: “Playing golf with Prime Minister Abe and Hideki Matsuyama, two wonderful people!”  Abe also chimed in on Twitter. He said: “A round of golf with a marvelous friend (President Donald J. Trump), full of spirited conversation.”  Trump and Abe will have dinner tonight with their wives.  ___  2:45 p.m.  U.S. first lady Melania Trump and her Japanese counterpart, Akie Abe, visited a pearl boutique in Tokyo’s posh Ginza shopping district while their husbands played golf.  The first ladies received a presentation on the history of pearl diving at Mikimoto, Japan’s top pearl jewelry maker.  A pair of female pearl divers showed up at the store, dressed in white diving suits and goggles.  Women have traditionally played a key role in Japan as pearl divers, known as “ama” or ocean woman.  Several hundred people showed up outside the store to take photos of the first ladies’ motorcade.  Trump's first official visit to the Asia will be extended by another day to attend the East Asian Summit. Speaking to reporters, the president predicted a ""successful"" trip. He also dismissed knowing ex-staffer George Papadopoulos well. (Nov. 3)  ___  2:25 p.m.  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is writing that he welcomes President Donald Trump “from the bottom of my heart.”  Shinzo posted a photo on Twitter on Sunday of the two leaders at the Kasumigaseki Country Club outside Tokyo. He wrote “we are having a business lunch over hamburgers.”  The two men ate lunch and then went to play 9 holes of golf.  ___  12:40 p.m.  President Donald Trump says he’s looking forward to golfing with Japan’s prime minister and one of the country’s top professional golfers.  Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday that Hideki Matsuyama (hih-DEH’-kee maht-soo-YAH’-mah) is “one of the greatest players” and is probably the “greatest player in the history of Japan.”  Trump is having lunch with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (shin-zoh AH’-bay) and Matsuyama on Sunday before a round of golf.  The president, who is an avid golfer, says Matsuyama is a “long ball hitter” and “if I come back and say I was longer than him, don’t believe it.”  Trump golfed with Abe in Florida in February. Abe presented Trump with a top-level driver by Japanese maker Honma soon after Trump won the presidency last November.  ___  12:15 p.m.  President Donald Trump and Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe are meeting on a championship golf course outside of Tokyo.  Trump and Abe shook hands and the U.S. president could be heard telling Abe that the scenery on the Kasumigaseki golf course is “beautiful.”  They posed for photos and were to have lunch with Japanese golfer Hideki Matsuyama (hih-DEH’-kee maht-soo-YAH’-mah) before all three play nine holes of golf.  As they entered the dining room, Trump and Abe signed a white hat that said: “Donald and Shinzo: Make Alliance Even Greater.” It was a tribute to the U.S.-Japan friendship and a play on Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan.  ___  12:05 p.m.  President Donald Trump says the U.S.-Japan alliance is a testament to the “transformative power of freedom.”  He observes that two countries that once waged war are now friends and partners in pursuit of a better world. That was an oblique reference to joint efforts by Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to pressure North Korea to give up its pursuit of nuclear weapons.  Trump addressed service members at Yokota Air Base near Tokyo after arriving in Japan, the first leg of his five-nation tour of Asia.  Japan’s surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, drew the U.S. to enter World War II.

Some regional analysts have speculated that Trump’s presence in Asia may prompt North Korea to take provocative action, such as carrying out a missile test.  When asked about that possibility, Trump said: “We’ll soon find out.”  The president also said he’ll go into his meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping (shee jihn-peeng) on equal footing.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)  FUSSA, Japan (AP) — President Donald Trump praised Japan as a “crucial ally” and warned adversaries not to test America’s resolve Sunday as he opened a grueling and consequential first trip to Asia.  Trump landed at Yokota Air Base on the outskirts of Tokyo and was greeted by cheering service members. Trump then donned a bomber jacket for a speech in which he touted American firepower and the U.S. alliance with Japan.  “Japan is a treasured partner and crucial ally of the United States and today we thank them for welcoming us and for decades of wonderful friendship between our two nations,” he said, speaking in front of an American flag inside an airplane hangar.  Trump was expected to spend much of his 12-day, five-country Asian tour exhorting allies and rivals to step up efforts to counter the dangers posed by North Korea, which continues to move forward with its nuclear weapons program. Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have been engaged in an escalating war of words, with Trump repeatedly referring to Un as “Little Rocket Man” and threatening in a recent speech to “totally destroy” the nation, if necessary.  Even before he landed, Trump used the first moments of the trip to denounce the North as “a big problem” that must “be solved.”  President Donald Trump and the first lady departed Hawaii for Japan, the first stop on his 12-day trip to Asia, where he will exhort allies and rivals on the need to counter the dangers posed by North Korea's nuclear threat. (Nov. 4)  “There’s been 25 years of total weakness, so we are taking a very much different approach” toward the North, he told reporters traveling with him.  During the speech, Trump did not mention North Korea by name, but warned of the consequences of crossing what he called the “most fearsome fighting force in the history of our world.”  “Together with our allies, America’s warriors are prepared to defend our nation using the full range of our unmatched capabilities. No one — no dictator, no regime and no nation — should underestimate, ever, American resolve,” Trump told the troops.  Some regional analysts have speculated that Trump’s presence in Asia may prompt North Korea to take provocative action, like another missile test. Trump, when asked about that possibility aboard Air Force One, said “we’ll soon find out.”  After the speech, Trump flew by helicopter to the Kasumigaseki Country Club about 20 miles outside of Tokyo for lunch and a round of golf with Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Japanese golfer Hideki Matsuyama. An avid golfer, Trump said Matsuyama is “probably the greatest player in the history of Japan.”  Trump and Abe have struck up a personal friendship, forged through multiple meetings and telephone conversations, as well as on the greens of one of Trump’s Florida golf clubs and over intimate dinners at Trump’s Florida estate.  At the club, the leaders signed white caps inscribed with the phrase, “Donald and Shinzo: Make Alliance Even Greater,” a tribute to the U.S.-Japan friendship and a play on Trump’s campaign slogan. On the menu: a hamburger made from U.S. beef.  The trip, which marks the longest Far East itinerary for a president in a generation, comes at a precarious moment for Trump. Days ago, his former campaign chairman was indicted and another adviser pleaded guilty as part of an investigation into possible collusion between Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russian officials.  The journey will also test Trump’s stamina. But the 71-year-old president assured reporters that he was up for the task. “It’s grueling, they tell me, but fortunately that’s historically not been a problem for me. One thing you people will say, that’s not been a problem,” he said.  The visit will be closely watched by Asian allies worried that Trump’s inward-looking “America First” agenda could cede power in the region to China. They also are rattled by his bellicose rhetoric toward North Korea. The North’s growing missile arsenal threatens several of the capitals Trump will visit.  The trip will also put Trump in face-to-face meetings with authoritarian leaders for whom he has expressed admiration. They include China’s Xi Jinping, whom Trump has likened to “a king,” and the Philippines’ Rodrigo Duterte, who has sanctioned the extrajudicial killings of drug dealers.  Trump is also expected to have a second private audience with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of a summit in Vietnam. Trump told reporters he “will want Putin’s help” in dealing with North Korea. They previously met during a summit in Europe this summer.  The White House has signaled that Trump will push American economic interests in the region, but the North Korea issue is expected to dominate the trip. One of Trump’s two major speeches will come before the National Assembly in Seoul. But fiery threats against the North could resonate differently than they do from the distance of Washington.  Trump will forgo a trip to the Demilitarized Zone, the stark border between North and South Korea. All U.S. presidents except one since Ronald Reagan have visited the DMZ in a sign of solidarity with Seoul. The White House contends that Trump’s commitment to South Korea is already crystal clear, as evidenced by his war of words with Kim and his threats to deliver “fire and fury” to North Korea if it does not stop threatening American allies.  The escalation of rhetoric, a departure from the conduct of past presidents, has undermined confidence in the U.S. as a stabilizing presence in Asia.  “There’s a danger if there is a lot of muscle flexing,” said Mike Chinoy, a senior fellow at the U.S.-China Institute at the University of Southern California. “Trump has been going right up to the edge and I wouldn’t rule out some sort of forceful North Korean reaction to Trump’s presence in the region,” he said.  The White House said Trump would be undeterred.  “The president will use whatever language he wants to use, obviously,” White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster told reporters before Trump departed Washington. “I don’t think the president really modulates his language, have you noticed?”  ___  Colvin reported from Tokyo.

1417,3037,11,5,2017,2017-11-05,Associated Press News,Brazile stirs Dem party strife as bellwether gov race nears," In this Monday, March 6, 2017, file photo, Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chairman Tom Perez speaks at a protest in Washington. The Democratic National Committee chairman, Perez, is questioning Donna Brazile's claim, his predecessor, that she could have initiated efforts to replace Hillary Clinton as the party's presidential nominee with then-Vice President Joe Biden. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats are struggling to put the bitter 2016 election behind them as the party’s current chairman and his predecessor bicker over Hillary Clinton’s failed campaign, further exposing deep divisions two days before the closely watched Virginia governor’s race that could foretell Democratic prospects in 2018 and beyond.  The dueling across Sunday news shows was triggered by the disclosure that Donna Brazile, the interim Democratic leader during the final months of the campaign, considered an effort to replace Clinton as the presidential nominee because of health concerns.  “The charge that Hillary Clinton was somehow incapacitated is quite frankly ludicrous,” said Tom Perez, who took over as Democratic National Committee chairman after Donald Trump won the election.  Brazile, who claimed “tremendous pressure” to devise a backup ticket led by then-Vice President Joe Biden after Clinton fainted at an event, pushed back: “Go to hell. I’m going to tell my story.”  The dispute was spurred by revelations by Brazile in a memoir being released Tuesday and reported on by The Washington Post. It reflected simmering tensions between establishment and insurgent wings that will set the party’s future course on issues from its platform to the primary schedule and use of superdelegates — party leaders and elected officials who get a say in the nomination — in the 2020 presidential race.  “One of the things, as we go forward, is to give more power to the grass roots in all this,” said House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California, urging Democrats not to “relitigate elections.”  Brazile writes that she considered initiating Clinton’s removal after the candidate collapsed while leaving a 9/11 memorial service in New York City, and Brazile contemplated a dozen combinations to replace Clinton and her running mate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine. Brazile wrote that she settled on Biden and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker as having the best chance of defeating Republican Trump.  Brazile says the larger issue was that Clinton campaign was “anemic” and had taken on “the odor of failure.”  But, she says, “I thought of Hillary, and all the women in the country who were so proud of and excited about her. I could not do this to them.”  The revelations elicited a strong weekend rebuttal from Clinton’s former campaign staffers. An open letter signed by more than 100 people said they “do not recognize the campaign” that Brazile “portrays in the book.”  The Clinton staffers responded they were “shocked to learn” that Brazile would consider overturning the will of Democratic voters. “It is particularly troubling and puzzling that she would seemingly buy into false Russian-fueled propaganda, spread by both the Russians and our opponent, about our candidate’s health.”  On Sunday, Perez echoed the complaints, saying Brazile never had authority under DNC rules to replace the ticket because Clinton was not incapacitated.  Under party rules, a DNC head can call a special meeting to fill a “vacancy” on the national ticket in the event of disability in coordination with Democratic leaders of Congress and Democratic governors, but only the full DNC can fill the vacancy. At the time, Clinton had revealed she was suffering from pneumonia.  “I don’t know what Donna Brazile fell for,” Perez said. “Hillary Clinton was anything but incapacitated. She was tireless.”  “I think people who read that charge, which is just without merit, are going to perhaps start wondering about other claims in the book,” he added.  The book’s revelations come just before Tuesday’s Virginia’s governor race, where Republicans have not won a significant statewide election since 2009. The Democratic candidate, Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, is casting the race to voters as a way to repudiate the policies of Trump against Ed Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman. But Northam has received lukewarm support within his own party from the progressive group Democracy for America.  A win for Democrats could help defuse Brazile’s book and give the party important momentum. A loss would be a big blow to other Democrats plotting a similar anti-Trump strategy in the 2018 midterm congressional races and likely spur louder calls for radical changes in the DNC heading into 2020. Also Tuesday is a New Jersey governor’s race, where Democrat Phil Murphy holds a solid lead over Republican Lt. Gov Kim Guadagno to succeed departing Gov. Chris Christie, also a Republican.  In an excerpt published earlier by Politico, Brazile had written that she believed a joint fundraising agreement signed between Clinton and the DNC “looked unethical” and that she felt Clinton had too much influence on the party during a competitive Democratic primary with rival Bernie Sanders.  Over the weekend, Perez issued a statement saying he and the DNC leadership were committed to ensuring that the nomination process in 2020 will be “unquestionably fair and transparent.”  Among the reforms he said he developed after listening to Democrats across the party spectrum was ensuring that “no candidate participating in our presidential nominating process gains any unfair advantage — real or perceived — during our primary season.” He also said the debate schedule would be decided in advance rather than negotiated after all candidates had entered the race.  Perez pledged to ensure that all joint fundraising agreements would be transparent, including the new Democratic Grassroots Victory Fund agreements developed with the 50 state parties.  Still in play are recommendations of a Unity Reform Commission, created in a concession to supporters of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders to re-examine the nominating process, including the role of superdelegates and primary scheduling.  “We have to make sure that everybody feels at the end of the process that everyone got a fair shake,” Perez said.  Perez spoke on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Brazile appeared on ABC’s “This Week,” and Pelosi was on CNN’s “State of the Union.”  ___  Associated Press writer Stephen Ohlemacher contributed to this report.",3.75,10,"[2.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 2.5]"

Korea sanctions,"In this Sept. 11, 2017 photo, Chinese custom officials inspect trucks loaded with goods to and from North Korea in Dandong in northeast China's Liaoning province. For Chinese traders, new United Nations sanctions on North Korea are a disaster. Business in the Chinese border city of Dandong has all but dried up as Chinese traders are unable to collect payment from impoverished North Korean state companies for goods such as toothpaste, instant noodles and other household items. Large-scale trade involving North Korean iron ore and coal has been banned entirely, dealing a big blow to Dandong’s port, whose operator defaulted on a $150 million corporate bond. (Chinatopix via AP)  BEIJING (AP) — For Yu Kaiguang, harsh new United Nations sanctions on North Korea are a disaster.  The trader in the Chinese border city of Dandong has seen business all but dry up, and he spends his days scrambling to obtain payment from the suddenly broke North Korean state companies to whom he sold on credit.  “They have no money to pay us in cash, and the worst is that because of sanctions they can’t settle the bill with goods such as coal, as they did in the past,” said Yu, reached by telephone at the offices of his Dandong Gaoli Trading Company.  Yu said he’s owed about $1 million in all for deliveries of toothpaste, instant noodles and other household items. He’s trying to avoid laying off staff by continuing to export foodstuffs such as pine nuts and red beans. “If they become unemployed, it would be bad for both the state and society.”  Yu’s plight appears increasingly commonplace across Dandong, where the bulk of the cross-border trade is handled. Interviews with four trading companies and recent media reports indicate Chinese companies are hurting in a city where North Korean trucks used to rumble across the Yalu River bridge several times a week delivering metal scrap and returning with everything from televisions to toilet bowls.  The owner of another firm, Dandong Baoquan Commerce and Trade Co., which used to import iron ore and coal and export basic consumer goods, said he was still owed around $200,000 by his North Korea clients.  “I had to lay off about 10 staffers, but I had no other choice because it was the government policy,” Han Lixin said, referring to the sanctions. “I’m still in business hoping to trade with other countries, but it takes a lot of time and efforts to develop customers.”  Large-scale trade involving North Korean resources such as iron ore and coal has been banned entirely under the sanctions, dealing a big blow to Dandong’s port, whose operator defaulted on a $150 million corporate bond this week in part because of cratering revenues.  “The sanctions have a broad effect, and both the economies of North Korea and China are suffering a lot,” said Jin Qiangyi, professor at the Institute of Northeast Asia Studies at Yanbian University in Northeast China. “Chinese companies doing business with North Korea may see quite a lot of losses, and the companies that have already invested in North Korea will suffer more.”  Dealing with North Korean companies was never easy. Wang Chengpeng, former manager of Dandong Hongwei Trading Company, quit doing business with the North entirely because of hassles, restrictions and low-profit margins, even before the latest sanctions began to bite.  Despite that, China has long been the North’s biggest economic partner. Beijing accounted for more than 90 percent of its neighbor’s foreign trade of about $6.5 billion in 2016, according to the South Korean-owned Korea Trade Investment Promotion Agency. China continues to be a key source of food and fuel aid to help keep North Korea’s weak economy from collapsing, and Chinese officials say they won’t agree to measures that could cut off basic life necessities and possibly cause Kim Jong Un’s dictatorship to topple.  China’s patience with Kim has grown increasingly thin, however, and Beijing has lent its support to increasingly tough resolutions unanimously approved by the Security Council this year that target North Korea’s economy in response to its ballistic missile launches and latest nuclear test.  China has said it sees sanctions purely as a means of inducing North Korea to return to nuclear disarmament talks and has rejected unilateral measures not approved by the Security Council, of which it is one of the five veto-wielding permanent members.  Still, despite some allegations of cheating, China appears to be seeking to enforce the sanctions that also ban exports of lead, textiles and seafood, prohibit joint ventures, and bar any country from authorizing new permits for North Korean workers — all sources of hard currency for Pyongyang.  The sanctions have also blacklisted a number of firms in the extraction and financial industries, imposed travel bans and frozen the assets of some government officials, banned the import of natural gas liquids and condensates, and capped the country’s crude oil imports.  It’s hard to gauge the exact impact of sanctions on the North Korean economy because the crucial food and energy sectors are less likely to be hurt by external conditions, said Lee Seok-ki, a senior researcher at the South Korean government-run Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade.  However, while the North’s economy has been expanding — by 3.9 percent in 2016, according to an estimate by the Bank of Korea in South Korea — that rate almost certainly can’t be sustained if sanctions continue, Lee said.  China for its part is watching North Korea to see how its ally will respond to the new measures, eager for signs of a shift in tactics by Kim and an improvement in relations between Beijing and Pyongyang that have “sunk into a standstill,” as Jin puts it.  In that context, Kim’s message of congratulation to President Xi Jinping upon his reappointment as leader of China’s ruling Communist Party last week is being cautiously viewed as a possible indication of change.  “There has been a calm from the North Korean side for about a month, and we are not sure whether it is because of the excessive pressure they are under or their miscalculation on China’s determination,” Jin said. “It’s still too early to say.”  ___  Associated Press writer Lee Youkyung in Seoul, South Korea, contributed to this report.",3.2142857142857144,14,"[4.5, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 4.0, 4.0, 2.5, 1.0, 0.5, 3.0, 4.0, 4.0, 2.5, 4.0]"

The two companies have been dancing around a possible merger for years, and were again in the news in recent weeks with talks of the two companies coming together after all. But in a joint statement Saturday, Sprint and T-Mobile said they are calling off merger negotiations for the foreseeable future.  “The prospect of combining with Sprint has been compelling for a variety of reasons, including the potential to create significant benefits for consumers and value for shareholders. However, we have been clear all along that a deal with anyone will have to result in superior long-term value for T-Mobile’s shareholders compared to our outstanding stand-alone performance and track record,” said John Legere, president and CEO of T-Mobile US, in a prepared statement.  T-Mobile and Sprint are the U.S.′ third- and fourth-largest wireless carriers, respectively, but they are significantly smaller than AT&T and Verizon, who effectively have a duopoly over U.S. wireless service. The two companies have said they hoped to find a way of merging to make the wireless market more competitive.  Sprint and its owner, the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, have long been looking for a deal as the company has struggled to compete on its own. But Washington regulators have frowned on a possible merger. D.C. spiked AT&T’s offer to buy T-Mobile in 2011 and signaled in 2014 they would have been against Sprint doing the same thing. But with the new Trump administration, it was thought regulators might be more relaxed about a merger.  Sprint has a lot of debt and has posted a string of annual losses. The company has cut costs and made itself more attractive to customers, BTIG Research analyst Walter Piecyk says, but it hasn’t invested enough in its network and doesn’t have enough airwave rights for quality service in rural areas.  T-Mobile, meanwhile, has been on a yearslong streak adding customers. After the government nixed AT&T’s attempt to buy it in 2011, T-Mobile led the way in many consumer-friendly changes, such as ditching two-year contracts and bringing back unlimited data plans. Consumers are paying less for cellphone service, thanks to T-Mobile’s influence on the industry and the resultant price wars.  “T-Mobile does not need a merger with Sprint to succeed, but Sprint might need one to survive,” Piecyk wrote in an October research note.",3.5555555555555554,18,"[2.5, 2.5, 4.5, 4.0, 5.0, 3.5, 3.0, 4.0, 2.5, 1.0, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5]"

Saudi Arabia has arrested dozens of princes and former government ministers, including a well-known billionaire with extensive holdings in Western companies, as part of a sweeping anti-corruption probe, further cementing King Salman and his crown prince son's control of the kingdom. A high-level employee at Prince Alwaleed bin Talal's Kingdom Holding Company told The Associated Press that the royal was among those detained overnight Saturday, Nov. 4, 2017. (AP Photo/Hassan Ammar, File)  RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Saudi Arabia’s heir to the throne is overseeing an unprecedented wave of arrests of dozens of the country’s most powerful princes, military officers, influential businessmen and government ministers — some potential rivals or critics of the crown prince now consolidating his power.  Among those taken into custody overnight Saturday in the purported anti-corruption sweep were billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, one of the world’s richest men with extensive holdings in Western companies, as well as two of the late King Abdullah’s sons.  The arrest of senior princes upends a longstanding tradition among the ruling Al Saud family to keep their disagreements private in an effort to show strength and unity in the face of Saudi Arabia’s many tribes and factions. It also sends a message that the 32-year-old crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has the full backing of his father, King Salman, to carry out sweeping anti-corruption reforms targeting senior royals and their business associates, who have long been seen as operating above the law.  Reports suggested those detained were being held at the Ritz Carlton in Riyadh, which only days earlier hosted a major investment conference that the crown prince attended with global business titans. A Saudi official told The Associated Press that other five-star hotels across the capital were also being used to hold some of those arrested.  The Ritz Carlton had no availability for bookings until Dec. 1, 2017 — a possible sign that an investigation of this scale could take weeks. Marriott International said in a statement that it is currently evaluating the situation at the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh, but declined to comment further, citing privacy concerns.  A Saudi government official with close ties to security forces said 11 princes and 38 others were being questioned. The official spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.  The surprise arrests were immediately hailed by pro-government media outlets as the clearest sign yet that Prince Mohammed is keeping his promise to reform the country, wean its economy from its dependence on oil and liberalize some aspects of the ultraconservative society.  The kingdom’s top council of clerics issued a public statement overnight saying it is an Islamic duty to fight corruption — essentially giving religious backing to the high-level arrests.  It’s unclear if the U.S. had any advance word of the arrests. President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and White House adviser Jared Kushner and others made an unannounced trip recently to Riyadh. Earlier on Saturday, Trump said he spoke to King Salman, though the White House readout of that call did not include any reference to the impending arrests.  The Saudi government says the arrests are part of a wider effort to increase transparency, accountability and good governance — key reforms needed to attract greater international investments and appease a Saudi public that has for decades complained of rampant government corruption and misuse of public funds by top officials. Surprise moves reshaping the kingdom, however, are likely to worry investors.  Among those reportedly taken into custody were two sons of the late King Abdullah: Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, who Saturday evening was ousted from his post as head of the prestigious National Guard tasked with protecting the Al Saud family, and Prince Turki bin Abdullah, who was once governor of Riyadh.  Prince Miteb was once considered a contender for the throne, though he has not been thought of recently as a challenger to Prince Mohammed.  Saudi Twitter accounts released several other names of those arrested, including Alwalid al-Ibrahim, a Saudi businessman with ties to the royal family who runs the Arabic satellite group MBC; Amr al-Dabbagh, the former head of the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority; Ibrahim Assaf, a former finance minister, and Bakr Binladin, head of the Saudi Binladin Group, a major business conglomerate.  Analysts have suggested the arrest of once-untouchable members of the royal family is a clear sign that the crown prince is sidelining potential rivals for the throne.  Meanwhile, the Saudi-owned, Dubai-based satellite news channel Al-Arabiya reported that a helicopter crash Sunday in the kingdom’s south killed Prince Mansour bin Murquin and seven others. Prince Mansour was the son of Prince Muqrin bin Abdulaziz, a former intelligence director and a one-time crown prince of the kingdom. Authorities gave no cause for the crash.  The young Crown Prince Mohammed has risen from near obscurity to become Saudi Arabia’s most talked about and powerful prince in less than three years since his father ascended to the throne. The prince’s swift rise to power has unnerved more experienced, elder members of the royal family, which has long ruled by consensus, though ultimate decision-making remains with the monarch.  The moves in Saudi Arabia mirror those in China, where President Xi Jinping has used corruption charges “as a battering ram to consolidate his own power and authority,” said John Hannah, the senior counselor at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, an Iran-skeptic think tank in Washington whose hawkish geopolitical views often coincide with the kingdom’s.  Hannah said Prince Mohammed has “latched onto corruption as a way to consolidate his power and remake the regime in his image,” purging those who might be resistant.  It is not clear what Prince Alwaleed or the others were being investigated for.  Without naming those arrested, the Attorney General’s office said “the suspects are being granted the same rights and treatment as any other Saudi citizen.” The statement did not disclose specific details about the investigation, but stressed that no assets have yet been frozen and that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.  A high-level employee at Prince Alwaleed bin Talal’s Kingdom Holding Co. told the AP that the royal was among those detained. The senior employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to fear of repercussions, said security bodies informed him of the arrest.  Prince Alwaleed’s many investments include Twitter, Apple, Citigroup, and the Four Seasons hotel chain. He is also an investor in ride-sharing services Lyft and Careem. He was once a significant shareholder in Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation, but sold much of those shares in 2015.  The prince, pictured sometimes on his 85-meter (278-foot) super-yacht in the Mediterranean, is among the most outspoken Saudi royals and a longtime advocate of women’s rights. He is also majority owner of the popular Rotana Group of Arabic channels.  After word of his arrest, his company’s stock dropped 7.6 percent in trading Sunday on the Saudi stock exchange.  An earlier crackdown this year on perceived critics of the crown prince included clerics and lesser-known princes.  In July, Prince Mohammed’s most formidable challenger to the throne, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, was plucked from the line of succession and ousted from his post as interior minister, overseeing internal security. This laid the groundwork for the king’s son to claim the mantle of crown prince.  Prince Mohammed’s gambles have not always succeeded . A yearslong war he has overseen as defense minister against Iranian-allied rebels in Yemen has not made the kingdom safer.  As news was unfolding about the anti-corruption probe, Saudi Arabia said late Saturday it had intercepted a ballistic missile fired from Yemen at Riyadh International Airport, on the outskirts of the capital.  “The dismissals and detentions suggest that Prince Mohammed rather than forging alliances is extending his iron grip to the ruling family, the military, and the national guard to counter what appears to be more widespread opposition within the family as well as the military to his reforms and the Yemen war,” James M. Dorsey, a Gulf specialist and senior fellow at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, said in an analysis of the shake-up.  ___  Associated Press writer Abdullah al-Shihri reported this story in Riyadh and AP writer Aya Batrawy reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

Trump is on a five country trip through Asia traveling to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. (Kiyoshi Ota/Pool Photo via AP)  TOKYO (AP) — Responding to a U.S. mass shooting for the second time in six weeks, President Donald Trump said Monday that it wasn’t “a guns situation” that was behind the slayings of more than two dozen worshippers at a Texas church a day earlier.  As he did following last month’s Las Vegas massacre of 58 people, Trump resisted any discussion of gun control during a news conference in Tokyo, where he was beginning his first presidential trip to Asia. Instead, Trump characterized the shooting as a “mental health problem at the highest level.” Yet White House officials said Trump is unlikely to call for a specific policy response, as he did after last week’s Islamic State group-inspired truck attack, which killed eight people in New York City.  Devin Kelley, the Texas gunman, was discharged from the Air Force several years ago for assaulting his spouse and a child, the Air Force said.  “This was a very — based on preliminary reports — a very deranged individual. A lot of problems over a long period of time,” Trump said when asked about the shooting as he and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe held a joint news conference.  Speaking from Tokyo, President Donald Trump called the deadly church shooting in Texas Sunday ""an act of evil."" (Nov. 5)  Trump’s more muted response to gun violence contrasts with his swift call for legislative and military action following the Oct. 31 truck attack in New York City. Within hours of a rental truck ramming through a crowded bicycle path and into a school bus, Trump called for Congress to “immediately” repeal the diversity visa lottery program that suspect Sayfullo Saipov, an Uzbekistan citizen, used to enter the country in 2010. Trump also claimed that the U.S. had already stepped up its retaliation against the Islamic State group after the attack.  “We are hitting them 10 times harder,” he said Friday.  After the Las Vegas shooting, Trump and aides said it was inappropriate to consider a policy response while people were still grieving. Despite days later suggesting openness to outlawing the bump stock device that allowed Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock to fire at near-automatic rates, the Trump administration has shown no signs of urgency.  “He has asked that that process be reviewed, and we’re waiting on some of the details of that to take place,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Oct. 27 when asked about bump stocks. “But a decision hasn’t been finalized on that. ”  Trump, who supported gun control before reversing his position to enter the Republican presidential primary, courted the National Rifle Association’s endorsement in 2016, and earlier this year became the first president in three decades to speak at the gun group’s annual convention.  In February, Trump signed legislation reversing an Obama-era regulation that would have made it harder for Americans with mental illnesses to buy a gun.  Under the Obama rule, the Social Security Administration would have been required to send in the names of beneficiaries with mental impairments who needed a third party to manage their financial affairs. The rule would have affected an estimated 75,000 beneficiaries who would have been added to the national background check database.  The attack happened in South Texas on Sunday morning when a man dressed in black tactical-style gear and armed with an assault rifle opened fire inside a Baptist church in a small community, killing 26 people and wounding 20 others in the deadliest mass shooting in state history.  As Kelley left the scene, authorities said, he was confronted by an armed resident. Kelley later was found dead in his vehicle.  Trump said, “Fortunately somebody else had a gun that was shooting in the opposite direction, otherwise it (wouldn’t) have been as bad as it was. It would have been much worse.”  Investigators believe Kelley shot himself.  ___  Associated Press writers Kevin Freking, Catherine Lucey and Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this report.",3.625,12,"[4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.0, 0.5, 1.5, 5.0, 4.5, 3.0, 4.0, 3.5]"

(AP Photo/Lee Jin-man, File)  SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — President Donald Trump arrived in South Korea on Tuesday on the second leg of his first official Asian tour. While Trump will be looking to use his trip to strengthen Washington’s alliance with Seoul and reaffirm their joint push to maximize pressure on North Korea over its nuclear program, he will also be faced with several thorny issues weighing on the relationship. Here’s a look at some of them.  __  NORTH KOREA  Both Trump and South Korea’s liberal President Moon Jae-in agree that it’s time to ramp up sanctions and pressure on North Korea, which has ignored international condemnation as it moves forward with its nuclear and missile tests.  But Moon, a former human rights lawyer, still favors dialogue as a way to defuse the nuclear tension and vehemently opposes a potential military clash, which experts believe would cause enormous casualties in South Korea. This contrasts with Trump, who has threatened the North with “fire and fury” and exchanged warlike rhetoric with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.  The world will be watching what kind of language Trump will use in his comments on North Korea. A hint at a military option or crude insults directed at Kim — like the term “Little Rocket Man” he previously used to deride the young North Korean dictator — is certain to enrage North Korea, which could react with weapons tests and threats of war.  Increasing animosity would be a burden for Moon.  __  TRADE  Renegotiating South Korea’s bilateral free trade agreement with the U.S., dubbed KORUS, is likely be high on the agenda during the Trump-Moon summit. Trump has criticized the deal as a source of the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea, an argument officials there dismiss.  Before Trump’s presidency, many in South Korea and the United States regarded the deal as a key pillar of their alliance. But Trump has made scrapping trade deals a hallmark of his presidency. Earlier this year, reports that Trump was considering triggering a withdrawal from the deal caused uproar not just in South Korea but also in the United States.  The two countries eventually started talks this summer on renegotiating the deal, which went into effect five years ago. Many South Koreans are watching if Trump will make off-the-cuff remarks on the trade deal during news conferences or on Twitter.  __  U.S. TROOPS  Trump wants South Korea to pay more for the U.S. military presence on its soil, which is chiefly aimed at deterring potential aggression from North Korea.  During election campaigning, Trump said South Korea and Japan must make more contributions for together hosting 80,000 U.S. troops or he might withdraw those soldiers. Security jitters subsequently flared among many in South Korea and Japan.  Since taking office in January, Trump hasn’t publicly threatened to pull out the troops but he harkened back to an election campaign request for greater burden-sharing with South Korea during his first summit talks with Moon in late June.  South Korea currently pays more than 900 billion won ($800 million) annually and negotiations with the United States are to start in the coming months to try to determine a new amount for South Korea to contribute.  __  U.S. MISSILE DEFENSE  South Korea’s recent agreement with China to try to end disputes over an advanced U.S. missile defense system deployed in South Korea could be an issue.  While announcing the deal last week, Beijing, which views the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system as a security threat, said it noted that Seoul stated it won’t do several things: deploying an additional THAAD battery, helping develop security cooperation with Japan and the U.S. into a trilateral military alliance and joining a global U.S. missile defense network. South Korea’s foreign minister made similar remarks during a parliament committee meeting earlier last week.  Critics say the South Korean moves, dubbed by local media as its “Three No” policies, could undermine the operational capability of the allied South Korea-U.S. forces and Trump’s push to bolter three-way cooperation with Seoul and Tokyo to put more pressure on Pyongyang.  Other issues at stake are South Korea’s hope to regain the wartime operational control of its troops, currently placed at the hands of the chief of the 28,000 U.S. troops in the South, and Seoul’s possible purchase of high-tech U.S. weapons systems.  __  Associated Press writer Youkyung Lee contributed to this report.  ___  This story has been corrected to show that Trump’s first summit with South Korea’s president took place in June, not July.",4.0,3,"[4.0, 5.0, 3.0]"

(AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell, File)  MEXICO CITY (AP) — Researchers were thrilled to have captured one of the few remaining vaquita porpoises, but announced Sunday that the adult female died after a few hours in captivity in a floating pen, raising questions about the last-ditch effort to enclose the world’s smallest porpoises to save them from extinction.  Critics, and even supporters of the international rescue effort, knew the plan was full of risks: The small marine mammals native to Mexico’s Gulf of California have never been held in captivity, much less bred there.  But with estimates of the remaining population falling below 30, the international team of experts known as Vaquita CPR felt they had no choice. In late October, researchers captured a vaquita calf but quickly freed it because it was showing signs of stress and was too young to survive without its mother.  On Saturday, the team felt its luck had turned when it caught a female in reproductive age. Mexico’s environment secretary, Rafael Pacchiano, tweeted a photo of the vaquita in a net sling late Saturday, saying: “This is a great achievement that fills us with hope.”  The vaquita was taken to a protected floating pen in the Gulf of California in the hopes that it would survive, and possibly breed if more vaquitas could be captured.  But on Sunday, the team said, “Veterinarians monitoring the vaquita’s health noticed the animal’s condition began to deteriorate and made the determination to release.”  “The release attempt was unsuccessful and life-saving measures were administered,” the team wrote. “Despite the heroic efforts of the veterinary team, the vaquita did not survive.”  “The entire rescue team is heartbroken by this devastating loss” wrote the team, which is using U.S. Navy-trained dolphins to help find the elusive species in the upper Gulf of California, also known as the Sea of Cortez. “The risk of losing a vaquita during field operations was always acknowledged as a possibility, but it was determined that it was unacceptable to stand by and watch the vaquita porpoise disappear without a heroic attempt at rescue.”  If it proves impossible to safely capture vaquitas, experts say an all-out effort will be needed to save them in their natural habitat. Vaquita populations have been decimated by illegal nets used to catch totoaba fish, whose swim bladder is prized in China.  “We are deeply saddened to learn that the vaquita captured on Saturday has died. We are confident that the experts involved in the capture did their best,” said Alejandro Olivera, the Mexico representative for the Center for Biological Diversity. “However, this should be a reminder for the Mexican government that ‘Plan A’ should never be forgotten. To truly protect these incredible little porpoises, the Mexican government must once and for all get deadly gillnets out of the vaquita’s habitat.”  Mexico has moved to ban gillnet fishing in the area, mounted a campaign to confiscate nets, and is trying to stop illegal fishing. But given the enormously high prices that totoaba swim bladders fetch on the black market, fishermen have used go-fast boats and stealth tactics that are hard to stop.  The environmental protection unit of the federal Attorney General’s Office said Sunday that authorities had seized four miles (6.4 kilometers) of nets, 5 metric tons of shrimp, and one shrimp boat as part of enforcement efforts in the second half of October. Authorities also seized three smaller boats and four vehicles.",3.3333333333333335,3,"[3.0, 3.5, 3.5]"

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)  WASHINGTON (AP) — After a day of partisan bickering over whether the Republicans’ sweeping tax plan would truly help the middle class, a key House panel on Monday approved late changes. Lawmakers restored the tax exemption for employees receiving child care benefits from their companies, but also put new requirements on a tax credit used by working people of modest means.  The House Ways and Means Committee voted 24-16 along party lines to adopt the amendment from its chairman, Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas. The changes were made to the complex GOP tax legislation put forward last Thursday.  The vote on the amendment capped a rancorous marathon session in which Republicans and Democrats argued heatedly over the nearly $6 trillion plan. Democrats repeatedly lodged objections to the bill, especially to its limits on prized deductions for homeowners and its repeal of the child adoption credit and the deduction for medical expenses.  It was the first of what are expected to be several days of work on the bill, as Republicans drive to push legislation through Congress and to President Donald Trump’s desk by Christmas.  Republicans focused on findings by Congress’ nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation that the bill would lower taxes across all income levels over the next several years.  “Clearly this is helping real people. It’s helping teachers, it’s helping students, it’s helping struggling families that are living paycheck to paycheck,” said GOP Rep. Erik Paulsen of Minnesota.  Democrats returned repeatedly to a section of the analysis showing taxes would actually go up beginning in 2023 for some 38 million taxpayers or families making $20,000 to $40,000 a year.  “There are a lot of people expecting a tax cut who would be big losers under this bill,” proclaimed Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey. “This is a joke and you’ve got to face up to it.”  At stake is whether the GOP will succeed in passing the most sweeping rewrite of the tax code in decades, which would be a major achievement for congressional Republicans and Trump after a year largely devoid of legislative wins. Looking ahead to 2018 midterms, Democrats and Republicans are both trying to win the debate over who is truly looking out for middle-class Americans.  The legislation adds $1.5 trillion to the ballooning national debt, delivers a major tax cut to corporations, and repeals the estate tax, which would benefit a tiny percentage of the wealthiest families in the country. It also simplifies the loophole-ridden tax code by collapsing today’s seven personal income tax brackets into four. It nearly doubles the standard deduction used by people who don’t itemize, and it increases the child tax credit, an element championed by first daughter Ivanka Trump.  Republicans argued vociferously that the legislation is targeted toward the middle class.  “It’s about making America’s economy stronger than ever by delivering more jobs, fairer taxes and bigger paychecks across the nation,” said Brady. He is aiming to push the legislation through committee and to the full House later this week, and GOP leaders are aiming for House passage before Thanksgiving.  The committee’s top Democrat, Richard Neal of Massachusetts, countered that the bill “puts the well-connected first while forcing millions of American families to watch while their taxes go up.” He complained that Republicans crafted it in private without input from Democrats.  The tax proposal is the first major rewrite of the U.S. tax code in three decades. After embarrassing failures to make good on years of promises to repeal “Obamacare,” the tax bill is enthusiastically backed by Trump, House GOP leaders and many rank-and-file Republicans, who are promising a simpler IRS code, a more globally competitive business tax structure, and tax cuts for the middle class and families with children.  But there’s considerable trepidation as well. In addition to the overall increases in later years for lower-income Americans, many earners in the upper-middle class, especially those from high-tax states, are facing tax increases. That’s because the measure would no longer permit taxpayers to deduct state income taxes from their federal taxes.  Powerful lobbyists are fighting to protect favored deductions, while a few well-financed interest groups, including the National Association of Homebuilders, have already vowed to oppose the legislation. The homebuilders group has voiced concerns over Republicans’ decision to lower the mortgage interest deduction from $1 million to $500,000.  ___  Associated Press writer Andrew Taylor contributed to this report.",3.323529411764706,17,"[4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 0.5, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 3.0, 2.5, 1.0, 4.0, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 0.5, 1.5]"
1450,3097,11,8,2017,2017-11-08,Associated Press News,"Amid booming economy, homelessness soars on US West Coast"," In a park in the middle of a leafy, bohemian neighborhood where homes list for close to $1 million, a tractor’s massive claw scooped up the refuse of the homeless - mattresses, tents, wooden frames, a wicker chair, an outdoor propane heater. Workers in masks and steel-shanked boots plucked used needles and mounds of waste from the underbrush.  Just a day before, this corner of Ravenna Park was an illegal home for the down and out, one of 400 such encampments that have popped up in Seattle’s parks, under bridges, on freeway medians and along busy sidewalks. Now, as police and social workers approached, some of the dispossessed scurried away, vanishing into a metropolis that is struggling to cope with an enormous wave of homelessness.  That struggle is not Seattle’s alone. A homeless crisis of unprecedented proportions is rocking the West Coast, and its victims are being left behind by the very things that mark the region’s success: soaring housing costs, rock-bottom vacancy rates and a roaring economy that waits for no one. All along the coast, elected officials are scrambling for solutions.  “I’ve got economically zero unemployment in my city, and I’ve got thousands of homeless people that actually are working and just can’t afford housing,” said Seattle City Councilman Mike O’Brien. “There’s nowhere for these folks to move to. Every time we open up a new place, it fills up.”  As the West Coast’s economy booms and more people move to the area, the number of homeless people has spiked to crisis levels. The Associated Press found that the number of homeless people is now 168,000 in California, Oregon and Washington. (Nov. 6)  The rising numbers of homeless people have pushed abject poverty into the open like never before and have overwhelmed cities and nonprofits. The surge in people living on the streets has put public health at risk, led several cities to declare states of emergency and forced cities and counties to spend millions - in some cases billions - in a search for solutions.  San Diego now scrubs its sidewalks with bleach to counter a deadly hepatitis A outbreak that has spread to other cities and forced California to declare a state of emergency last month. In Anaheim, home to Disneyland, 400 people sleep along a bike path in the shadow of Angel Stadium. Organizers in Portland lit incense at a recent outdoor food festival to cover up the stench of urine in a parking lot where vendors set up shop.  Homelessness is not new on the West Coast. But interviews with local officials and those who serve the homeless in California, Oregon and Washington - coupled with an Associated Press review of preliminary homeless data - confirm it’s getting worse. People who were once able to get by, even if they suffered a setback, are now pushed to the streets because housing has become so expensive.  All it takes is a prolonged illness, a lost job, a broken limb, a family crisis. What was once a blip in fortunes now seems a life sentence.  “Most homeless people I know aren’t homeless because they’re addicts,” said Tammy Stephen, 54, who lives at a homeless encampment in Seattle. “Most people are homeless because they can’t afford a place to live.”  Among the AP’s findings:  — Official counts taken earlier this year in California, Oregon and Washington show 168,000 homeless people in the three states, according to an AP tally of every jurisdiction in those states that reports homeless numbers to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. That is 19,000 more than were counted two years ago, although the numbers may not be directly comparable because of factors ranging from the weather to new counting methods.  — During the same period, the number of unsheltered people in the three states - defined as someone sleeping outside, in a bus or train station, abandoned building or vehicle - has climbed 18 percent to 105,000.  — Rising rents are the main culprit. The median one-bedroom apartment in the San Francisco Bay Area is significantly more expensive than it is in the New York City metro area, and apartments in San Francisco are listed at a higher price than those in Manhattan.  — Since 2015, at least 10 cities or municipal regions in California, Oregon and Washington - and Honolulu, as well - have declared states of emergency due to the rise of homelessness, a designation usually reserved for natural disasters.  “What do we want as a city to look like? That’s what the citizens here need to decide,” said Gordon Walker, head of the regional task force for the homeless in San Diego, where the unsheltered homeless population has spiked by 18 percent in the past year. “What are we going to allow? Are we willing to have people die on the streets?”  ___  With alarming frequency, the West Coast’s newly homeless are people who were able to survive on the margins - until those margins moved.  For years, Stanley Timmings, 62, and his 61-year-old girlfriend, Linda Catlin, were able to rent a room in a friend’s house on their combined disability payments.  Last spring, that friend died of colon cancer and the couple was thrust on Seattle’s streets.  Timmings used their last savings to buy a used RV for $300 and spent another $300 to register it. They bought a car from a junk yard for $275.  Now, the couple parks the RV near a small regional airport and uses the car to get around.  They have no running water and no propane for the cook stove. They go to the bathroom in a bucket and dump it behind a nearby business. They shower and do laundry at a nonprofit and buy water at a grocery depot. After four months, the stench of human waste inside the RV is overwhelming. Every inch of space is crammed with their belongings: jugs of laundry detergent, stacks of clothes, pots and pans, and tattered paperback novels. They are exhausted, scared and defeated, with no solution in sight.  “Between the two of us a month, we get $1,440 in disability. We can’t find a place for that,” he said. “Our income is (about) $17,000 ... a year. That puts us way out of the ballpark, not even close. It might have been enough but anymore, no. It’s not.”  A new study funded by the real estate information firm Zillow and conducted by the University of Washington found a strong link between rising housing prices and rising homelessness numbers. A 5 percent rent increase in Los Angeles, for example, would mean about 2,000 more homeless people there, the authors said.  Nationally, homelessness has been trending down, partly because governments and nonprofit groups have gotten better at moving people into housing. That’s true in many West Coast cities, too, but the flow the other direction is even faster. And on the West Coast, shelter systems are smaller.  “If you have a disability income, you make about $9,000 a year and renting a studio in Seattle is about $1,800 a month and so that’s twice your income,” said Margaret King, director of housing programs for DESC, a nonprofit that works with Seattle’s homeless.  “So everybody who was just hanging on because they had cheap rent, they’re losing that ... and they wind up outside. It’s just exploded.”  Nowhere is that more evident than California’s Silicon Valley, where high salaries and a tight housing market have pushed rent out of reach for thousands. In ever-shifting communities of the homeless, RVs and cars cluster by the dozens in the city where Google built its global headquarters and just blocks from Stanford University.  Ellen Tara James-Penney, a lecturer at San Jose State University, has been sleeping out of a car for about a decade, ever since she lost her housing while an undergraduate at the school where she now teaches four English courses, a job that pays $28,000 a year. Home is an old Volvo.  “I’ve basically been homeless since 2007, and I’m really tired,” she said. “Really tired.”  She actually got her start in the high tech industry, before being laid off during the tech meltdown of the early 2000s. Like many who couldn’t find work, she went to college, accumulating tens of thousands of dollars in student debt along the way.  Now 54, she grades papers and prepares lesson plans in her car. Among her few belongings is a pair of her grandmother’s fancy stiletto pumps, a reminder to herself that “it’s not going to be like this forever.”  Increased housing costs aren’t just sweeping up low-income workers: The numbers of homeless youth also is rising.  A recent count in Los Angeles, for example, found that those ages 18 to 24 were the fastest-growing homeless group by age, up 64 percent, followed by those under 18. Los Angeles and other cities have made a concerted effort to improve their tallies of homeless youth, which likely accounts for some of the increase.  One of the reasons is the combined cost of housing and tuition, said Will Lehman, policy supervisor at Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority. A recent study by the University of Wisconsin found that one in five Los Angeles Community College District students is homeless, he said.  “They can pay for books, for classes but just can’t afford an apartment. They’re choosing to prioritize going to school,” Lehman said. “They don’t choose their situation.”  ___  Michael Madigan opened a new wine bar in Portland a few years ago overlooking a ribbon of parks not far from the city’s trendy Pearl District.  Business was good until, almost overnight, dozens of homeless people showed up on the sidewalk. A large encampment on the other side of the city had been shut down, and its residents moved to the park at his doorstep.  “We literally turned the corner one day ... and there were 48 tents set up on this one block that hadn’t been there the day before,” he said.  Madigan’s business dropped 50 percent in four months and he closed his bar. There are fewer homeless people there now, but the campers have moved to a bike path that winds through residential neighborhoods in east Portland, prompting hundreds of complaints about trash, noise, drug use and illegal camping.  Rachel Sterry, a naturopathic doctor, lives near that path and sometimes doesn’t feel safe when she’s commuting by bike with her 1-year-old son. Dogs have rolled in human feces in a local park; recent improvements she’s made to her small home are overshadowed by the line of tents and tarps a few dozen yards from her front door, she said.  “I have to stop and get off my bike to ask people to move their card game or their lounge chairs or their trash out of the way when I’m just trying to get from point A to point B,” she said. “If I were to scream or get hurt, nobody would know.”  For Seattle resident Elisabeth James, the reality check came when a homeless man forced his way into a glass-enclosed ATM lobby with her after she swiped her card to open the door for after-hours access. After a few nerve-wracking minutes, the man left the lobby but stayed outside, banging on the glass. Police were too busy to respond so James called her husband, who scared the man away and walked her home. The man, she believes, just wanted to get out of the rain.  A neighborhood pocket park has become a flashpoint, too: When James took her 2-year-old grandchild there, she saw people injecting heroin.  “I’m not a NIMBY person, but I just think that we can do so much more,” said James, who founded an activist group called Speak Out Seattle last year. “I wanted to do something that was effective, that brought frustrated people together to find solutions. We’re spending a lot of money to house people and we’re getting a bigger problem.”  The crisis is not limited to large metropolises. In Oregon City, a suburban, working-class town of 36,000 people, the police department this summer added a full-time position for a homeless outreach officer after roughly half the calls concerned trash, trespassing, human waste and illegal encampments.  The city has no overnight shelters and never had a significant homeless population until about three years ago.  On a recent fall day, officer Mike Day tromped into a greenbelt across from a strip mall to check on a man he recently connected with a counselor, calmed an intoxicated man and arranged emergency care for a man who was suicidal.  “How many social workers have you met that go into the woods to follow up with the homeless population and to help with mental health? This is a bit of a hybrid position, certainly, and maybe it’s not exactly the role of a police officer - but it’s a creative approach to find a solution to the problem,” he said.  The question was, “What can we do differently? Because right now, it’s not working.”  ___  All along the West Coast, local governments are scrambling to answer that question - and taxpayers are footing the bill.  Voters have approved more than $8 billion in spending since 2015 on affordable housing and other anti-homelessness programs, mostly as tax increases. Los Angeles voters, for example, approved $1.2 billion to build 10,000 units of affordable housing over a decade to address a ballooning homeless population that’s reached 34,000 people within city limits.  Seattle spent $61 million on homeless-related issues last year, and a recent budget proposal would increase that to $63 million. Four years ago, the city spent $39 million on homelessness. Sacramento has set a goal of moving 2,000 people off the streets in the next three years and may place a housing bond before voters in 2018.  Appeals for money have angered residents who see tent encampments growing in their cities despite more spending.  “Those are like whack-a-mole because they just sprout up and then they disappear and then they sprout up somewhere else,” said Gretchen Taylor, who helped found the Neighborhood Safety Alliance of Seattle in 2016.  Seattle is initiating competitive bidding among nonprofit organizations for city dollars going toward homelessness programs. It’s also pouring money into “rapid rehousing,” a strategy that houses people quickly and then provides rental assistance for up to 18 months.  Like San Francisco, Seattle has started opening 24-hour, “low-barrier” shelters that offer beds even if people are abusing drugs, have a pet or want to sleep together as a couple. But the city’s first 24-hour shelter has only 75 beds, and turnover is extremely low.  A team of specially trained police officers and social workers has also been visiting homeless camps to try to place people in shelter. After repeated visits - and with 72 hours of notice - the city cleans out the camps and hauls away abandoned belongings.  These efforts are starting to yield results, although the overall number of homeless people continues to swell.  Nearly 740 families moved into some type of shelter between October 2016 and August 2017, and 39 percent of the people contacted by the new police teams wind up sheltered, according a recent city homeless report. That’s an improvement from a 5 percent shelter rate 18 months ago, said Sgt. Eric Zerr, who leads that effort.  But the approach has its detractors. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit alleging the sweeps violate the constitutional protections against unreasonable search and seizure. And a debate is raging about whether the sweeps are necessary “tough love” or a cruel policy that criminalizes poverty in a city with a reputation for liberalism.  “When a city can’t offer housing, they should not be able to sweep that spot unless it’s posing some sort of significant health and safety issue,” said Sara Rankin, a professor with the Homeless Rights Advocacy Project at the Seattle University School of Law.  “If someone doesn’t have a place to go, you can’t just continue to chase them from place to place.”  ___  Above all, the West Coast lacks long-term, low-income housing for people like Ashley Dibble and her 3-year-old daughter.  Dibble, 29, says she has been homeless off and on for about a year, after her ex-boyfriend squandered money on his car and didn’t pay the rent for three months. Evicted, Dibble says she lived in the back of a moving truck and with several different friends around Seattle before winding up on the streets. She sent her toddler to live with the girl’s paternal grandparents in Florida.  She and her new boyfriend were sleeping under tarps near Safeco Field, home of the Seattle Mariners, when an outreach team referred them to a new shelter. Now, Dibble talks to her daughter daily by phone and is trying to find a way back into housing so she can bring her home.  With an eviction on her record and little income, no one will rent to her.  “I’ve had so many doors slammed in my face, it’s ridiculous,” Dibble said, wiping away tears.  Seattle’s DESC operates 1,200 so-called “permanent supportive housing units” -housing for the mentally ill or severely addicted who can’t stay housed without constant help from case managers, counselors and rehabilitation programs. The nonprofit completes a new building every 18 months and they immediately fill; at any given time, there are only about eight to 10 units free in the whole city - but 1,600 people qualify.  Among this population, “almost nobody’s going to get housing because there isn’t any,” DESC’s Margaret King said. “It doesn’t really matter.”  There is so little housing, and so much despair. Nonprofit workers with decades of experience are shocked by the surge in homeless people and in the banality of the ways they wound up on the streets.  “It’s a sea of humanity crashing against services, and services at this point are overwhelmed, literally overwhelmed. It’s catastrophic,” said Jeremy Lemoine, an outreach case manager with REACH, a Seattle homeless-assistance program. “It’s a refugee crisis right here in the States, right here under our noses.”  “I don’t mean to sound hopeless. I generate hope for a living for people - that there is a future for them - but we need to address it now.”  ___  Associated Press writers Janie Har in San Francisco, Julie Watson in San Diego and Chris Weber in Los Angeles contributed to this report.

(AP Photo/Shizuo Kambayashi, File)  TOKYO (AP) — Japanese internet and solar company SoftBank Group Corp. is raising its stake in Sprint Corp. after merger talks with T-Mobile collapsed, signaling its commitment to a turnaround at the U.S. wireless carrier.  Tokyo-based SoftBank reported Monday that July-September net profit tumbled to 113 billion yen ($991 million) from 528 billion yen a year ago.  Quarterly sales rose nearly 4 percent to 2.23 trillion yen ($19.5 billion) on improved results at Sprint, as well as revenue from Arm, a British chips company SoftBank acquired last year.  Helping bring profit lower was the absence of last year’s foreign-exchange gains, as well as derivative losses that came from its sale of part of its stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.  T-Mobile and Sprint are the third- and fourth-largest wireless carriers, respectively, in the U.S., but they are significantly smaller than AT&T and Verizon, which effectively have a duopoly over the U.S. wireless service.  Wireless carriers Sprint and T-Mobile called off a potential merger Saturday, saying the companies couldn’t come to an agreement that would benefit customers and shareholders.  The two companies have been dancing around a possible merger for years, and were again in the news in recent weeks with talks of them coming together after all. But in a joint statement Saturday, Sprint and T-Mobile said the negotiations were off for the foreseeable future.  Sprint has debt and has been losing money, but its results had been improving gradually, partly because of additional investments from SoftBank, which also sells the Pepper humanoid.  But both analysts and SoftBank had said they believed Sprint needs a deal, rather than trying to compete on its own.  But Washington regulators have frowned on a possible merger. D.C. spiked AT&T’s offer to buy T-Mobile in 2011, and signaled in 2014 they would have been against Sprint doing the same thing. But with the new Trump administration, it was thought regulators might be more relaxed about a merger.  SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son told reporters that the talks fell apart because T-Mobile did not want to be equal partners in management. But he insisted Sprint will prove a gold mine because of the move to IoT, where SoftBank’s investment in Arm will pay off, especially in the U.S.  “We are entering an era where billions of new connected devices and sensors will come online throughout the United States,” he said. “Sprint is a critical part of our plan to ensure that we can deliver our vision to American consumers and we are very confident in its future.”  Son said he felt “absolutely great” after the merger talks ended because worries over indecisiveness were gone.  “It was an important decision,” he said. “But the day will come when having Sprint will pay off.”  Although Arm’s sales grew from the previous year, its losses grew as well because of costs for hiring engineers.  Son, credited as a visionary and seen in the company of high-profile people like Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates and President Donald Trump, has been aggressive in investing in artificial intelligence, the internet of things and renewable energy.  Son has set up a $100 billion SoftBank Vision Fund specially for the technology sector with money from Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and other investors.  SoftBank’s Japanese mobile business continued to do well in the last quarter, increasing smartphone subscribers, according to the company. SoftBank was the first carrier in Japan to offer Apple’s iPhone.  It also owns the SoftBank Hawks baseball club, which recently won the Japan Series, this nation’s equivalent of the World Series.  ___  Yuri Kageyama can be reached at twitter.com/yurikageyama  Her work can be found at https://www.apnews.com/search/yuri%20kageyama",3.21875,16,"[4.0, 3.5, 0.5, 2.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 0.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 2.5, 4.0, 4.5]"

FILE - In this Oct. 12, 2017, file photo, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross appears before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on Capitol Hill in Washington. In an echo of the Red Scare that consumed the nation for generations, business relationships once seen normal now appear tainted if they are connected at all to Russia. A shipping company partly owned by Ross, President Donald Trump’s commerce secretary, is one of the few in the world that can transport liquefied petroleum gas in cold and icy conditions. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)  MOSCOW (AP) — A shipping company partly owned by President Donald Trump’s commerce secretary is one of the few in the world that can transport liquefied petroleum gas in cold and icy conditions. Russia is known for its brutal winters as well as its giant, state-controlled oil and gas producers.  So, for years, Wilbur Ross’ company has been moving LPG for a Russian gas giant.  But now, in what might seem almost an echo of the Red Scare that lasted in America for generations, this business relationship is seen as tainted, an ominous connection to a country that unleashed cyberwar against American democracy and the 2016 election that put Trump in the White House.  Are all connections to Russia now suspect? Or are they sometimes merely an inconvenient consequence of doing business in a country where major corporations often are controlled by the Kremlin?  The latest tie between Russia, Trump and his campaign and administration officials came to light Sunday with news that the U.S. commerce secretary is a part owner of Navigator Holdings, a shipping company that transports LPG produced by Sibur, a big Russian company with ties to the Kremlin.  Some shipping business experts who follow the company are shrugging off the news.  “Russia has a lot of commodities that need to go somewhere else,” said Benjamin J. Nolan, a financial analyst who covers Navigator for Stifel, Nicolaus & Co. He added, “Odds are, they are going to have long term contracts with Western shipping companies.”  The Russian government is a powerful factor in almost every part of the country’s economy. Some of Russia’s biggest banks, such as Sberbank and VTB are state-controlled, with their management answering directly or indirectly to the Kremlin.  Then there is Gazprom, a big gas supplier to Europe, and Rosneft, the oil producer. Both are majority state owned.  The new Russian giant in the spotlight, Sibur, has its own special connections to the state, and President Vladimir Putin in particular. It is partially owned by a man said to be Putin’s son-in-law, and two of its biggest shareholders are oligarchs close to Putin. One of them is his old judo partner.  The details of Ross’ stake in Navigator were found among 13.4 million leaked records on offshore entities used by the rich and powerful and famous. They are the biggest leak on the shadowy offshore financial system since the Panama Papers last year, and could shed more light on the byzantine ways companies and individuals hide their wealth or lower their taxes.  Following news of the leak, Ross has said in interviews that his ties to Russia are being blown out proportion. He told Britain’s Sky network that his Navigator stake had been previously disclosed in financial documents filed with government ethics officials, and noted that Sibur is not under any U.S. sanction. For its part, Sibur has said that only a tiny percentage of shipping business goes to Navigator, less than 3 percent of “logistics expenses.” It said that it is surprised by the “politically driven interpretation” in some media reports of its “ordinary business operations.”  Trump himself also has faced scrutiny over his business ties to Russia. In prepared remarks to the Senate and House intelligence committees, Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, disclosed that the Trump Organization had been pursuing a business proposal in Russia during the presidential campaign. Cohen has said that the proposal for a Trump Tower Moscow never came to fruition and denied it had any impact on the campaign, saying it was “solely a real estate deal and nothing more.”  No evidence has yet emerged that the business deals are being examined by special counsel Robert Mueller. The former FBI director is investigating the Kremlin’s interference in the 2016 election and any possible coordination with Trump associates.  As for Ross, the most obvious link to Putin is Kirill Shamalov, who is married to a woman who is said to be Putin’s youngest daughter. Shamalov once owned more than 20 percent of Sibur, but has since cut that stake to 3.9 percent, according to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, the group that has been reviewing the new trove of documents.  Another Kremlin link is the Putin’s old judo partner, Gennady Timchenko, the second largest shareholder of Sibur.  Businessmen with Kremlin links are sometimes tapped to work on key projects with political symbolism, such as the bridge to Crimea or the Sochi Olympics. Timchenko’s construction company has a role building stadiums for next year’s soccer World Cup.  Timchenko was sanctioned by the U.S. after Russia annexed the Crimea. The U.S. also barred banks from providing long-term financing to a gas company belonging to Sibur’s largest shareholder, Leonid Mikhelson.  Ross has never met Sibur’s Shamalov, Timchenko and Mikhelson, according to a Commerce Department statement, and was not involved in his shipping company’s negotiations with Sibur.  Kremlin connections can boost the fortunes of U.S. companies, but they can also backfire. Russian partners sometimes come under suspicion abroad that they are acting out of political, not purely commercial, motives.  The state gas company Gazprom, in particular, has been accused of manipulating price talks over natural gas to put pressure on governments of other European countries, particularly Ukraine. That’s prompted many European countries to seek gas supplies from elsewhere.  A deal between Rosneft and Exxon Mobil also has run into trouble. The Treasury Department fined Exxon Mobil $2 million in July over what it called “reckless disregard” for U.S. sanctions by signing deals with Rosneft’s sanctioned head Igor Sechin in May 2014. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was the U.S. oil firm’s CEO at that time.  Exxon has maintained it did nothing wrong and sued the U.S. government in an effort to stop the fine.  As for Ross’ Navigator, some experts say it’s hardly surprising the company counts a Russian company among its customers.  “Russia is the biggest producer of oil, and that needs to be sold in a global market place,” said Jonathan Chappell, a financial analyst at Evercore. “Navigator is perfectly positioned.”  ----  Condon reported from New York.

1477,3138,11,7,2017,2017-11-07,Associated Press News,‘We still need to eat’: Tech boom creates working homeless," In the same affluent, suburban city where Google built its headquarters, Tes Saldana lives in a crowded but tidy camper she parks on the street.  She concedes it’s “not a very nice living situation,” but it also is not unusual. Until authorities told them to move, more than a dozen other RVs filled with people who can’t afford rent joined Saldana on a tree-lined street in Mountain View, parked between a Target and a luxury apartment complex.  Homeless advocates and city officials say it’s outrageous that in the shadow of a booming tech economy - where young millionaires dine on $15 wood-grilled avocado and think nothing of paying $1,000 for an iPhone X - thousands of families can’t afford a home. Many of the homeless work regular jobs, in some cases serving the very people whose sky-high net worth is the reason housing has become unaffordable for so many.  Across the street from Saldana’s camper, for example, two-bedroom units in the apartment complex start at $3,840, including concierge service. That’s more than she brings home, even in a good month.  Saldana and her three adult sons, who live with her, have looked for less rustic accommodations, but rents are $3,000 a month or more, and most of the available housing is distant. She said it makes more sense to stay in the camper near their jobs and try to save for a brighter future, even if a recent city crackdown chased them from their parking spot.  “We still need to eat,” said Saldana, 51. “I still want to bring my kids, once in a while, to a movie, to eat out.”  She cooks and serves food at two hotels in nearby Palo Alto, jobs that keep her going most days from 5 in the morning until 10 at night. Two of her sons, all in their 20s, work at a bakery and pay $700 toward the RV each month. They’re all very much aware of the economic disparity in Silicon Valley.  “How about for us people who are serving these tech people?” Saldana said. “We don’t get the same paycheck that they do.”  It’s all part of a growing crisis along the West Coast, where many cities and counties have seen a surge in the number of people living on the streets over the past two years. Counts taken earlier this year show 168,000 homeless people in California, Oregon and Washington - 20,000 more than were counted just two years ago.  The booming economy, fueled by the tech sector, and decades of under-building have led to an historic shortage of affordable housing. It has upended the stereotypical view of people out on the streets as unemployed: They are retail clerks, plumbers, janitors - even teachers - who go to work, sleep where they can and buy gym memberships for a place to shower.  The surge in homelessness has prompted at least 10 local governments along the West Coast to declare states of emergency, and cities from San Diego to Seattle are struggling to come up with immediate and long-range solutions.  San Francisco is well-known for homeless tent encampments. But the homeless problem has now spread throughout Silicon Valley, where the disparity between the rich and everyone else is glaring.  There is no firm estimate on the number of people who live in vehicles in Silicon Valley, but the problem is pervasive and apparent to anyone who sees RVs lining thoroughfares; not as visible are the cars tucked away at night in parking lots. Advocates for the homeless say it will only get worse unless more affordable housing is built.  The median rent in the San Jose metro area is $3,500 a month, yet the median wage is $12 an hour in food service and $19 an hour in health care support, an amount that won’t even cover housing costs. The minimum annual salary needed to live comfortably in San Jose is $87,000, according to a study by personal finance website GoBankingRates.  So dilapidated RVs line the eastern edge of Stanford University in Palo Alto, and officials in neighboring Mountain View have mapped out more than a dozen areas where campers tend to cluster, some of them about a mile from Google headquarters.  On a recent evening, Benito Hernandez returned to a crammed RV in Mountain View after laying flagstones for a home in Atherton, where Zillow pegs the median value of a house at $6.5 million. He rents the RV for $1,000 a month and lives there with his pregnant wife and children.  The family was evicted two years ago from an apartment where the rent kept going up, nearing $3,000 a month.  “After that, I lost everything,” said Hernandez, 33, who works as a landscaper and roofer.  He says his wife “is a little bit sad because she says, ‘You’re working very hard but don’t have credit to get an apartment.’ I tell her, ‘Just wait, maybe a half-year more, and I’ll get my credit back.’”  The plight of the Hernandez family points out one of the confounding problems of the homeless surge along the West Coast.  “This is not a crisis of unemployment that’s leading to poverty around here,” said Tom Myers, executive director of Community Services Agency, a nonprofit based in Mountain View. “People are working.”  Mountain View, a city of 80,000 which also is home to Mozilla and 23andMe, has committed more than $1 million over two years for homeless services, including money for an outreach case manager and a police officer to help people who live in vehicles. At last count, there were people living in more than 330 vehicles throughout the city.  Mayor Ken Rosenberg is proud of the city’s response to the crisis - focusing not on penalties but on providing services. Yet he’s also worried that the peace won’t last as RVs crowd into bike lanes and over-taxed streets.  Last week, Mountain View officials posted signs banning vehicles more than 6 feet high on some parts of the street where Saldana, Hernandez and others living in RVs were parked, saying they were creating a traffic hazard. The average RV is well over that height.  That follows similar moves over the summer by Palo Alto, which started cracking down on RVs and other vehicles that exceed the 72-hour limit on a busy stretch of El Camino Real.  In San Jose, officials recently approved an ordinance pushed by an interfaith group called the Winter Faith Collaborative to allow places of assembly - including gyms and churches - to shelter homeless people year-round.  Ellen Tara James-Penney, a 54-year-old lecturer at San Jose State University, parks her old Volvo at one of those safe haven churches, Grace Baptist Church, and eats in its dining hall. She is paid $28,000 a year to teach four English classes and is carrying $143,000 in student debt after earning two degrees.  She grades papers and prepares lessons in the Volvo. At night, she leans back the driver’s seat and prepares for sleep, one of two dogs, Hank, by her side. Her husband, Jim, who is too tall for the car, sleeps outside in a tent cot with their other dog, Buddy.  The Bay Area native remembers the time a class was studying John Steinbeck, when another student said that she was sick of hearing about the homeless.  “And I said, ‘Watch your mouth. You’re looking at one.’ Then you could have heard a pin drop,” she said. “It’s quite easy to judge when you have a house to live in or you have meds when you’re depressed and health care.”  In response to growing wealth inequities, unions, civil rights groups and community organizations formed Silicon Valley Rising about three years ago. They demand better pay and benefits for the low-income earners who make the region run.  SEIU United Service Workers West, for example, organized roughly 3,000 security guards who work for companies that contract with Facebook, Google and Caltrain, the mass transit system that connects Silicon Valley with San Francisco.  One of those workers is Albert Brown III, a 46-year-old security officer who recently signed a lease for half of a $3,400 two-bedroom unit in Half Moon Bay, about 13 miles from his job.  He can barely afford the rent on his $16-an-hour salary, even with overtime, but the car that doubled as his home needed a pricey repair and he found a landlord willing to overlook his lousy credit. Still, Brown worries he won’t be able to keep up with his payments.  His feet have been hurting. What if a doctor tells him to rest for a few days or a week?  “I can’t miss a minute. If I miss a minute or a shift? No way, man. A week? Forget it, it’s over. It’s all downhill from there,” he said.  “It’s a sad choice. I have to decide whether to be homeless or penniless, right?”  ___  Follow Janie Har at https://twitter.com/search?q=Janie%20Har&src=typd  Follow AP’s complete coverage of the homeless crisis here: https://apnews.com/tag/HomelessCrisis",4.115384615384615,13,"[4.5, 0.5, 3.0, 5.0, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 5.0, 5.0]"

(Kim Hong-ji/Pool Photo via AP)  SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — President Donald Trump said efforts to curb North Korea’s nuclear weapons program would be “front and center” of his two-day visit to South Korea and he projected optimism that the rising tensions could be abated peacefully.  Trump repeatedly addressed interlocking issues of security and trade at the heart of his visit after arriving Tuesday, saying he would be meeting with generals about North Korea. “Ultimately it will all work out. Because it always works out. It has to work out,” he said.  And later, after receiving a formal welcome from South Korean President Moon Jae-in, Trump also praised Seoul’s expansive purchases of American military equipment, which he said goes a long way to making the trade relationship between the two nations more equitable.  Moon said he hoped Trump’s visit would be an opportunity to resolve “anxiety” in the region over North Korea.  “I know that you have put this issue at the top of your security agenda,” Moon said at the presidential residence known as the Blue House, “so I hope that your visit to Korea and to the Asia Pacific region will serve as an opportunity to relieve some of the anxiety that the Korean people have due to North Korea’s provocations and also serve as a turning point in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue.”  President Donald Trump, speaking in Japan, said the shooting that killed 26 people in a church near San Antonio, Texas is the result of a 'mental health problem at the highest level. (Nov. 6)  Trump, in his own brief remarks, said Pyongyang would be “front and center” of discussions but avoided the fiery language he has used so often against North Korea and its dictator, Kim Jong Un.  The president also said he had a “terrific” meeting scheduled on trade, adding, “hopefully that’ll start working out and working out so that we create lots of jobs in the United States, which is one of the very important reasons I’m here.”  Trump, during a visit to Camp Humphreys that began his visit, sat with troops for lunch in a large mess hall. Moon was also seated at the table. “Good food,” Trump told reporters as he chatted with U.S. and Korean service members.  U.S. and South Korean officials have said the base visit was meant to underscore the countries’ ties and South Korea’s commitment to contributing to its own defense. Burden-sharing is a theme Trump has stressed ever since his presidential campaign.  South Korea is the second stop on Trump’s five country Asian tour. In Japan, he refused to rule out eventual military action against the north and exhorted dictator Kim Jong Un to stop weapons testing, calling the recent launches of missiles over American allies like Japan “a threat to the civilized world and international peace and stability.”  Trump is skipping the customary trip to the demilitarized zone separating north and south — a pilgrimage made by every U.S. president except one since Ronald Reagan as a demonstration of solidarity with the South. A senior administration recently dubbed the border trip as “a bit of a cliche” and several other members of the administration, including Vice President Mike Pence, have visited the DMZ this year. And the White House believes that Trump has already made his support of South Korea crystal clear.  Trump and Moon agree on the need to pressure the North with sanctions and other deterrence measures. But Trump has warned of unleashing “fire and fury,” threatened to “totally destroy” the North, if necessary, and repeatedly insisted that all options are on the table. Moon, meanwhile, favors dialogue as the best strategy for defusing the nuclear tension and vehemently opposes a potential military clash that could cause enormous casualties in South Korea.  Trump backed up his strong words about North Korea by sending a budget request to Capitol Hill on Monday for $4 billion to support “additional efforts to detect, defeat, and defend against any North Korean use of ballistic missiles against the United States, its deployed forces, allies, or partners.”  And as he departed for South Korea, he tweeted that Moon is “a fine gentleman,” adding, “We will figure it all out!”  On a personal level, Trump and Moon have not developed the same close rapport as Trump has with Abe or even China’s Xi Jinping. Part of Moon’s mission during the visit will likely be to strengthen his personal ties with Trump, said Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution.  “Now poor President Moon is playing catch-up ball because everyone acknowledges that he’s not bonding quite as much with Donald Trump as the rest of the region,” said O’Hanlon. He said Moon could face pressure “to deliver a stronger relationship” whereas “in most other parts of the world, people are trying to keep their distance from Donald Trump.”  Trump was spending Tuesday in meetings with Moon, hold a joint press conference and be feted at a state dinner.  Trade also is expected to be a major topic of discussion: Trump has considered pulling out of the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement, also known as KORUS, blaming it for the U.S.-South Korea trade deficit.  ___  Associated Press writers Ken Thomas and Catherine Lucey in Washington contributed to this report.  ___  Follow Colvin on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@colvinj and Lemire at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire.",4.5,1,[4.5]

(AP Photo/Lee Jin-man)  SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Hundreds of South Koreans took to the streets of Seoul on Tuesday for two separate demonstrations, one to show support for visiting President Donald Trump and the other to voice disapproval of the U.S. leader amid concerns over North Korea’s nuclear threats.  Surrounded by thousands of police officers and a tight perimeter created by buses, hundreds of anti-Trump protesters rallied at a boulevard near the U.S. Embassy, holding banners that read “No Trump” and “No War.”  The demonstrators accused the outspoken president of raising tensions with North Korea and pressuring Seoul to buy more U.S. weapons. They also criticized him for pressing Seoul to re-do a bilateral free trade deal between the countries so that it’s more favorable to the United States.  Across the street, hundreds of Trump supporters waved the U.S. and South Korean flags and held signs that read “Blood Allies Korea + US.” They chanted “USA!” when Trump’s motorcade passed by the two protest groups for a meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in at the presidential Blue House.  More than 15,000 officers will be deployed to provide security during Trump’s two-day visit and monitor the demonstrations, according to the National Police Agency.  Anti-Trump protesters scuffled with South Korean police on Tuesday while trying to hold a rally against President Donald Trump's visit to Seoul. The demonstrators called for Trump to apologize for his rhetoric against North Korea. (Nov. 7)  Police had unsuccessfully attempted to block anti-Trump protesters from marching in streets near the presidential palace, with the Seoul Administrative Court ruling that such a ban would infringe on the protesters’ freedom of assembly. Dozens of anti-Trump protesters rallied near the presidential office earlier on Tuesday under the close watch of police.  “We oppose the visit to South Korea by Trump, who has heightened the fears of war on the Korean Peninsula,” said one of the protesters, reading from a statement.  The group, which calls itself the “No Trump Coalition,” also plans to protest on Wednesday near Seoul’s parliament, where Trump is to make a speech calling on the international community to maximize pressure on North Korea.  Pro- and anti-Trump protesters have been staging dueling but peaceful protests in Seoul in recent weeks ahead of Trump’s visit, reflecting a public deeply divided along ideological and generational lines.  Many South Koreans are concerned that Trump’s fiery rhetoric on North Korea, which has included threats of military options, is raising the risk of an unwanted war on the Korean Peninsula that could cost thousands of South Korean lives.  Others, including older people who tend to be more conservative, are supportive of Trump’s tough stance against the North, which has been accelerating its nuclear weapons and missile tests in recent months, and accuse liberal South Korean President Moon of being too soft on Pyongyang.  South Korea is known for its vibrant, and occasionally violent, protest culture that sometimes results in significant political changes. Massive but peaceful street protests by millions drove lawmakers to impeach then-President Park Geun-hye over a corruption scandal in December. Park was formally removed from office and arrested in March over charges including bribery and extortion.  The conservative Korea Freedom Federation released a statement welcoming Trump’s visit, which it described as a “God-like move” that would “instantly reverse” the security situation on the peninsula after the allies had been forced to the “defensive” by North Korea’s weapons tests. However, the group also lamented Trump’s decision not to visit the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between the Koreas during his visit to the South, saying that it might lead North Korea to misjudge that its provocations have hurt the allies’ morale.  Meanwhile, in the Philippines, dozens of protesters burned a portrait of Trump in downtown Manila on Tuesday, saying the president, who will join a summit of East Asian leaders next week in the country, is not welcome there.

(AP Photo/Martin Meissner)  BONN, Germany (AP) — Fiji’s prime minister called for a sense of urgency in the fight against global warming Monday, telling negotiators “we must not fail our people,” as he opened two weeks of talks on implementing the Paris accord on combating climate change, which is already affecting his Pacific island nation.  While diplomats and activists gathered in Bonn, the U.N. weather agency said 2017 is set to become the hottest year on record aside from those impacted by the El Nino phenomenon.  The talks in Germany are the first major global climate conference since President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. will pull out of the 2015 Paris accord unless he can secure a better deal, and the first time that a small island nation is chairing such a conference.  Negotiators will focus on thrashing out some of the technical details of the Paris accord, which aims to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. While Trump has expressed skepticism, a recent U.S. government report concluded there is strong evidence that man-made climate change is taking place.  Fiji Prime Minister Voreqe ‘Frank’ Bainimarama, the Bonn conference’s chairman, offered greetings “from one of the most climate-vulnerable regions on earth,” underlining “our collective plea for the world to maintain the course we set in Paris.”  “The need for urgency is obvious,” he said. “Our world is in distress from the extreme weather events caused by climate change.”  “We must not fail our people” and must make the Paris accord work, Bainimarama said, adding that means to “meet our commitments in full, not back away from them.”  He didn’t refer directly to the Trump administration’s position, but appeared to play off Trump’s “America first” slogan.  “The only way for every nation to put itself first is to lock arms with all other nations and move forward together,” the Fijian leader declared.  In a brief statement toward the end of the opening session Monday, a senior U.S. diplomat told delegates that Washington’s position hadn’t changed since Trump’s announcement in June.  But Trigg Talley, the U.S. deputy special envoy for climate change, said the United States will “continue to participate in international climate change negotiations and meetings, including ongoing negotiations related to guidance for implementing the Paris agreement.”  The meeting began with schoolchildren chanting “Save the World” processing into the conference hall and a traditional Fijian welcoming ceremony.  The U.N.’s World Meteorological Organization said this year is already on track to be one of the three hottest years of all time, after 2015 and 2016, which were both affected by a powerful El Nino — a weather phenomenon that can contribute to higher temperatures. .  WMO says key indicators of climate change — such as rising carbon-dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, rising sea levels and the acidification of oceans — “continue unabated” this year.  It said the global mean temperature from January to September this year was about a half-degree Celsius warmer than the 1981-2010 average, which was estimated to be 14.31 degrees C (57.76 Fahrenheit).  The five-year average temperature from 2013 to 2017 is more than 1 degree Celsius higher than that during the pre-industrial period.  WMO says 2017 has been marked by higher-than-average rainfall in places like western China, southern South America and the contiguous United States; lower-than-average arctic sea-ice extent.  Participants at the Bonn conference include diplomats from 195 nations, as well as scientists, lobbyists and environmentalists. French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other leaders are expected to appear near the end of the summit to give the talks a final push.  German Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks called for “significant progress” in Bonn on implementing the Paris accord.  “The Paris agreement is irreversible,” she told delegates Monday. “We now have to do everything in our power to implement it and we do not have much time left.”  ___  Moulson reported from Berlin.

German Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks told negotiators that “we have to make significant progress on implementing the Paris agreement here.”  She added: “The Paris agreement is irreversible. We now have to do everything in our power to implement it and we do not have much time left.”  ___  12:05 p.m.  The U.N.’s weather and climate agency says 2017 is set to become the hottest year on record, apart from those impacted by the El Nino phenomenon.  The World Meteorological Organization says this year is already on track to be one of the three hottest years of all time, after 2015 and 2016. Those were both affected by a powerful El Nino, which can contribute to higher temperatures. Last year set a new record for the average global temperature.  The warning was timed for the start on Monday of the latest U.N. climate change conference, in Bonn, Germany.  WMO says key indicators of climate change such as rising carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, rising sea level and acidification of oceans “continue unabated” this year.  It said the global mean temperature from January to September this year was about a half-degree Celsius warmer than the 1981-2010 average.  ___  11:45 p.m.  Fiji’s prime minister has told climate negotiators that “the need for urgency is obvious” as diplomats opened talks on implementing the Paris agreement to fight climate change.  Prime Minister Voreqe ‘Frank’ Bainimarama, who is chairing the two-week meeting in the German city of Bonn, offered greetings “from one of the most climate-vulnerable regions on earth” as he addressed the conference Monday.  Bainimarama said nations should “meet our commitments in full, not back away from them.”  He didn’t refer directly to President Donald Trump’s announcement that the U.S. will pull out of the Paris climate accord unless his administration can secure a better deal.  But Bainimarama says “the only way for every nation to put itself first is to lock arms with all other nations and move forward together.”  ___  9:25 a.m.  Diplomats and activists have gathered in Germany for two-week talks on implementing the Paris agreement to fight climate change.  Environmental groups staged protests in the western city of Bonn and at a nearby coal mine ahead of the meeting to highlight Germany’s continued use of heavily polluting fossil fuels.  The 23rd conference of the parties, or COP23, will be opened Monday by Fiji’s Prime Minister Voreqe ‘Frank’ Bainimarama. The Pacific island nation is already suffering the impacts of global warming.  Negotiators will focus on thrashing out some of the technical details of the 2015 Paris accord, which aims to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.  While President Donald Trump has expressed skepticism, a recent U.S. government report concluded there’s strong evidence that man-made climate change is taking place.",4.666666666666667,3,"[4.5, 5.0, 4.5]"
1518,3186,11,7,2017,2017-11-07,Associated Press News,"Democrats sweep Virginia, New Jersey governor’s races"," Voters in Virginia and New Jersey gave Democratic gubernatorial candidates large victories Tuesday and sent a clear message of rebuke to Republican President Donald Trump.  In Virginia’s hard-fought contest, Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie. In New Jersey, front-running Democrat Phil Murphy trounced Republican Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno to succeed unpopular GOP Gov. Chris Christie.  The victors said Tuesday’s electoral results had far-reaching repercussions in a sharply divided country.  “Virginia has told us to end the divisiveness, that we do not condone hatred and bigotry,” Northam said.  “The days of division are over. We will move forward,” Murphy said in his own victory speech, invoking Trump by name as he looked headed to a double digit win. Murphy, who earned a fortune at Goldman Sachs before serving as Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, delivered his address in the same spot as Christie in his 2013 re-election— after Christie won big over his Democratic rival.  The wins in both states are a morale boost to Democrats who had so far been unable to channel anti-Trump energy into success at the ballot box in a major election this year.  In a contest viewed by many as a referendum on President Donald Trump, Democrat Ralph Northam accepted victory on Tuesday night in the Virginia governor's race. AP reporter Steve Peoples breaks down what it means nationally. (Nov. 7)  “The people are gonna rise up. They’re not gonna take what he says and this is not fake news,” said Leanna Barnes, a 76-year-old from East Orange, New Jersey, who voted for Murphy and called his victory a message to the president.  Virginia college student Tamia Mallory said she began paying attention to her state’s gubernatorial race when she saw tweets from Trump endorsing Gillespie. That motivated her to examine the race and find out who was running against Gillespie, she said.  “It was kind of an anti-Trump vote,” Mallory said.  Northam, the state’s lieutenant governor, repeatedly sought during long months of divisive campaigning to tie Gillespie to the president. His victory was in large part due to the surge in anti-Trump sentiment since the president took office. Democrats said they had record levels of enthusiasm heading into the race in Virginia, a swing-state and the only Southern state Trump lost last year.  Gillespie, meanwhile, sought to keep Trump at a distance throughout the campaign but tried to rally the president’s supporters with hard-edge attack ads focused on illegal immigration and preserving Confederate statues. The strategy was criticized by Democrats and some Republicans as race baiting, but drew praise from former Trump strategist Steve Bannon and others as a canny approach in a state that voted for Hillary Clinton last year.  Trump lent limited pre-election support to Gillespie with robocalls and tweets.  In one call, Trump said Gillespie shared his views on immigration and crime and would help “Make America Great Again.” Trump also said Northam would be a “total disaster” for Virginia.  But after Tuesday’s loss, Trump suggested that Gillespie hurt himself by not more closely aligning himself with the president.  “Ed Gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for,” Trump said in a tweet after Northam won. He also pointed out that Republicans have won every special election to the U.S. House since he was elected.  Northam’s victory is a blow to Republicans, who were hoping that Gillespie could provide a possible roadmap for moderate Republicans to follow in next year’s midterm elections. Several Republicans have announced plans to retire next year instead of seeking re-election, and Gillespie loss may prompt more such announcements.  A former White House aide to President George W. Bush and a Washington lobbyist, Gillespie struck a humble tone in his concession speech as he offered support to Northam. Gillespie wiped tears from his eyes while thanking his wife and said the million people who voted for him love Virginia, and so do those who disagree with them.  “And I know they too are rooting for our new governor to succeed because we all love the commonwealth of Virginia,” Gillespie said.  The mood was subdued at Gillespie’s gathering at a Richmond-area hotel, with supporters not shocked at the outcome but surprised at how poorly Republicans did. Democrats swept all three of Virginia’s statewide races and nearly wiped out Republicans’ overwhelming majority in the Virginia House of Delegates on Tuesday. A handful of races that will decide control of the body remaining too close to call.  Gillespie supporter Elsa Smith said Republicans needed to do a better job of appealing to minorities if they want to win future races.  “We are not taking care of the demographics the way we should,” said Smith, an owner of a Spanish translation business.  Democrats were gleeful at Northam’s victory party. U.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly called Northam the “perfect antidote” to the president.  “This is a comprehensive victory from the statehouse to the courthouse. Thank you, President Trump,” Connolly said.  The Democratic victories are another sign of Virginia’s shift toward a more liberal electorate. Democrats have won every statewide election since 2009 and now have won four out of the last five gubernatorial contests. Northam, pediatric neurologist and Army doctor, banked heavily during the campaign on his near-perfect political resume and tried to cast himself as the low-key doctor with a strong Southern drawl as the healer to Trump’s divisiveness.  ___  Catalini reported from Asbury Park, New Jersey.

(AP Photo/Cliff Owen)  Democrats swept Virginia and New Jersey’s governor’s races, incumbents came out on top in several big-city mayoral races and voters in Maine said they wanted to join 31 other states in expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.  A rundown of the top races around the country on Tuesday:  TWO GOVERNORS  Voters in two states picked replacements for their term-limited governors — Democrat Terry McAuliffe in Virginia and Republican Chris Christie in New Jersey — in contests seen as an early referendum on the presidency of Donald Trump. In swing state Virginia, Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie. In New Jersey, front-running Democrat Phil Murphy overcame Republican Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno.  The stakes were high as both parties sought momentum ahead of next year’s midterm elections. Democrats haven’t won any special elections for Congress this year and the next Virginia governor will have a major say in the state’s next round of redistricting, when Congressional lines are drawn. Republicans were looking for a boost as their party is beset by intraparty turmoil between Trump and key Republicans in Congress.  Seattle voters will elect their first female mayor since 1926 on election day, with two female candidates vying for the office. One analyst says it signals a trend for women winning mayoral seats in Washington state. (Nov. 7)  BIG-CITY MAYORS  Democrat Bill de Blasio won a second term as mayor of heavily Democratic New York City. He easily defeated Republican state lawmaker Nicole Malliotakis and several third-party candidates.  In Boston, Mayor Marty Walsh won a second four-year term by beating City Councilor Tito Jackson after a low-key campaign.  Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan won a second four-year term by defeating state Sen. Coleman Young II, whose father was the city’s first black mayor. Duggan was first elected after a state-appointed manager filed for Detroit’s historic bankruptcy.  Two Atlanta city councilwomen, Keisha Lance Bottoms and Mary Norwood, were the top two vote-getters in the city’s mayoral race from a field of nearly a dozen candidates and are now headed to a Dec. 5 runoff. The winner will replace term-limited Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed.  In Seattle, former U.S. Attorney Jenny Durkan took a strong early lead in the race for mayor. Voters were choosing between Durkan and urban planner Cary Moon to replace former Mayor Ed Murray, who resigned earlier this year amid sexual abuse allegations. Ballot counting in the all mail-in election will continue over the next several days.  Charlotte, North Carolina, is getting its sixth mayor since 2009. Mayor Pro Tem Vi Lyles, a Democrat, beat Republican City Councilman Kenny Smith.  MEDICAID  Maine voters approved a measure allowing them to join 31 other states in expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. The referendum represented the first time since the signature health bill of former President Barack Obama took effect that the question of expansion was put before U.S. voters. Maine’s Republican governor had vetoed five attempts to expand the program.  UTAH’S CONGRESSIONAL SEAT  The Republican mayor of the Mormon stronghold of Provo, Utah, won a special election to replace U.S. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who resigned earlier this year. In an expected victory in the heavily Republican congressional district, John Curtis beat Democrat Kathryn Allen and third-party candidate Jim Bennett.  PHILADELPHIA DISTRICT ATTORNEY  Philadelphia’s next district attorney is Larry Krasner, a liberal Democrat who vows to end mass incarceration and the death penalty. He replaces Democrat Seth Williams, who was sentenced to prison last month for accepting a bribe.  CONTROL OF WASHINGTON  Democrat Manka Dhingra took an early lead in a state Senate race that will determine whether the Washington state Senate will remain the only Republican-led legislative chamber on the West Coast. If the seat flips to Democrats , Washington will join Oregon and California with total Democratic rule in both legislative chambers and the governor’s office. Under the state’s vote-by-mail system, ballots just need to be postmarked or dropped off by Tuesday, which means that final results may not be known for days.",2.7,5,"[3.0, 1.5, 4.0, 1.0, 4.0]"

President Trump delivered a sharp warning to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Wednesday, telling him the weapons he's acquiring ""are not making you safer. They are putting your regime in grave danger.""(Kim Hong-Ji/Pool Photo via AP)  SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — President Donald Trump delivered a sharp warning to North Korea Wednesday, telling the rogue nation: “Do not underestimate us. And do not try us.”  In a speech delivered hours after he aborted a visit to the heavily fortified Korean demilitarized zone due to bad weather, Trump said he had a message for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.  “The weapons you are acquiring are not making you safer, they are putting your regime in grave danger,” Trump told an audience of South Korean lawmakers, calling on all nations to join forces “to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea.”  “The world cannot tolerate the menace of a rogue regime that threatens with nuclear devastation,” he said.  Trump had hoped to underscore his message with an early morning visit to the DMZ, but his plans were thwarted by heavy fog that prevented his helicopter from landing at the heavily fortified border that has separated the North and South for the last 64 years.  The Marine One helicopter left Seoul at daybreak and flew most of the way to the DMZ, but was forced to turn back just five minutes out due to poor weather conditions. Reporters traveling in a separate helicopter as part of the president’s envoy saw fog through the windows, and weather reports from near the heavily fortified border showed misting conditions and visibility below one mile. Pilots, officials said, could not see the other helicopters in the air.  US President Donald Trump delivered a blunt warning to North Korea: ""Do not underestimate us. And do not try us."" Trump sent the message during a speech to South Korea's National Assembly in Seoul. (Nov. 8)  White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president was disappointed he couldn’t make the trip. “I think he’s pretty frustrated,” she told reporters. “It was obviously something he wanted to do.”  Before he left for Asia, a White House official had ruled out a DMZ visit for Trump, claiming the president didn’t have time on his schedule and that DMZ visits have become a little cliché.  But Sanders said the visit had been planned well before Trump’s departure for Asia. The trip was kept secret for security reasons, she said.  The aborted visit came hours before Trump addressed the South Korean National Assembly as he closed out his two-day visit to the nation and headed to his next stop, Beijing.  In the speech, Trump painted a bleak portrait of life in North Korea, describing citizens as bribing government officials to leave the country just so they can work as slaves. He contrasted the poverty and desperation to thriving South Korea — home to a long list of top-rated golfers, he noted.  Trump said the U.S. will not allow its cities to be threatened with destruction, and said that, while America “does not seek conflict or confrontation,” it will not run from it, either.  “The regime has interpreted America’s past restraint as weakness. This would be a fatal miscalculation?,” Trump said. “This is a very different administration than the United States has had in the past.”  He also called on all nations to downgrade diplomatic and economic ties with the North and fully implement a series of U.N. Security Council measures, specifically calling out Russia and China, whose leaders he will meet in coming days.  On Tuesday, Trump’s first day on the Korean Peninsula, he had signaled a willingness to negotiate as he urged North Korea to “come to the table” and “make a deal” over its nuclear weapons program.  He also said he’d seen “a lot of progress” in dealing with Pyongyang, though he stopped short of saying whether he wanted direct talks.  “It makes sense for North Korea to come to the table and make a deal that is good for the people of North Korea and for the world,” Trump said at a news conference with South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in.  He also sounded an optimistic note on disagreements with the North, saying confidently, if vaguely: “Ultimately, it’ll all work out.”  It was a striking shift in tone for a president who for months had issued increasingly dire threats to answer any hostile North Korean action with “fire and fury.” In a recent speech at the United Nations, Trump said he would “totally destroy” the nation, if necessary, and has derided Kim as “little Rocket Man.”  North Korea has fired more than a dozen missiles this year but none in nearly two months. Analysts caution against reading too much into the pause.  Ever the showman, Trump had teased that he had a surprise in store, saying at a Tuesday evening banquet that he had an “exciting day” planned Wednesday — “for many reasons that people will find out.” He did not elaborate on what turned out to be the aborted trip to the DMZ.  Visiting the border that has become something of a ritual for U.S. presidents trying to demonstrate their resolve against North Korea’s ever-escalating aggression. Every American president since Ronald Reagan, save for George H.W. Bush, has made the trip, peering across the barren north through binoculars, hearing broadcast propaganda and reaffirming their commitment to standing with the South.  Visiting the wooded, craggy terrain inside the DMZ is like going back in time to 1953. In July of that year, the Korean War armistice agreement was signed at Panmunjom, the so-called “truce village” bisected by a marker that is the official dividing line between the North and South.  There’s no public sign of any diplomatic progress between Washington and Pyongyang. U.S. officials say the back channel between the State Department and the North Korean mission at the United Nations in New York remains intact, but contacts have not been substantive other than achieving the release of American college student Otto Warmbier in June. He died days after his repatriation to the U.S.  Moon, who has been eager to solidify a friendship with Trump, said he hoped the president’s visit would be a turning point in the standoff with North Korea.  ___  Associated Press writers Zeke Miller and Matthew Pennington in Washington contributed to this report.  ___  Follow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire and Colvin at http://twitter.com/@colvinj",4.75,2,"[5.0, 4.5]"

(Thomas Peter/Pool Photo via AP)  BEIJING (AP) — China reported that its politically volatile trade surplus with the United States narrowed in October from the previous month as President Donald Trump arrived Wednesday on an official visit with commercial issues high on his agenda.  China’s global exports rose 6.9 percent to $188.9 billion, a decline from September’s 8.1 percent growth, customs data showed. Imports rose 17.2 percent to $150.9 billion, down from the previous month’s 18.7 percent increase.  Exports to the United States rose 11.2 percent while imports of U.S. goods rose 17.4 percent, the customs agency reported.  The trade surplus with the United States was $26.6 billion, a decline of $1.5 billion from September but a 12.2 percent increase compared with a year earlier. The total surplus with the United States for the first nine months of the year was $223 billion.  Export growth was unexpectedly strong in the first half of the year, a positive sign for Chinese leaders who want to avoid job losses in trade-related industries as they try to nurture consumer-led economic growth.  The outlook for Chinese exports has been clouded by mounting pressure from Washington to narrow the country’s trade surplus. The Trump administration has boosted duties Chinese goods such as stainless steel and plywood to offset what it says are improper subsidies.  “Export growth eased somewhat in October to a pace that is still solid, indicating that global demand momentum remains resilient,” Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics said in a report. “However, as trade with the U.S. takes the limelight amid U.S. President Trump’s China visit, we estimate that the U.S.’s trade deficit with China will rise to close to $370 billion this year, adding to trade tensions.”  Trump has complained about the size of the U.S. trade gap with China but has yet to say what he might propose in Beijing.  His government also is investigating whether Beijing is violating its free-trade commitments by pressuring foreign companies to hand over technology in return for market access.  Some American companies worry Trump’s focus on trade in goods might mean he pays too little attention to barriers to market access in services such as finance and health care.  China’s trade surplus with the 28-nation European Union, its biggest trading partner, narrowed by 6.6 percent to $11.3 billion.  ___  General Administration of Customs of China: www.customs.gov.cn",3.75,6,"[4.5, 2.5, 4.5, 4.0, 3.0, 4.0]"

Trump is on a five country trip through Asia traveling to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)  BEIJING (AP) — After a brief truce with China to cooperate on North Korea, President Donald Trump arrived in Beijing on Wednesday amid mounting U.S. trade complaints, with limited prospects for progress on market access, technology policy and other sore points.  The strains between the world’s two biggest economies are fueling anxiety among global companies and advocates of free trade that they could retreat into protectionism, dragging down growth.  Washington accuses Beijing of backsliding on market-opening promises, and Trump said last week that the U.S. trade deficit with China — $347 billion last year — is “so bad that it’s embarrassing.”  “I don’t want to embarrass anybody four days before I land in China, but it’s horrible,” said Trump.  His government has raised import duties on Chinese aluminum foil, stainless steel and plywood, and is investigating whether Beijing improperly pressures foreign companies to hand over technology.  If they discuss trade during the two-day visit, Chinese President Xi Jinping’s government is unlikely to offer enough “to appease U.S. negotiators,” said John Davies of BMI Research.  That is likely to lead to “more protectionist measures on the part of the U.S.,” said Davies.  While Trump is looking to boost sagging public approval ratings, the Chinese leader enters their meeting on a political high.  The ruling Communist Party added Xi’s name to its constitution at a twice-a-decade congress last month, giving him status equal to Mao Zedong, founder of the communist government, and Deng Xiaoping, who launched economic reforms in 1979.  At the congress, Xi promised to open the economy wider but affirmed plans to build up state-owned companies that dominate industries including finance, energy and telecoms. That, along with plans for government-led development of electric cars and other technology, makes foreign companies worry that Beijing is squeezing them out of promising fields.  The chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, William Zarit, expressed concern that Trump appears to have done too little to prepare and said some companies worry his focus on trade in goods will mean he does too little about such “structural issues.” Zarit said those include limits on access to finance, health care and other industries.  In contrast to “advance work” for previous presidential trips to Beijing, “there really hasn’t been much of that for this visit, which makes us a bit concerned that there may not be much discussion on the structural issues,” said Zarit, a former American diplomat.  A senior administration official who briefed reporters in Washington denied that Trump hasn’t adequately prepared.  “We’ve analyzed this probably more than most administrations,” said the official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified further.  The official said Beijing has shifted to “moving away from market-based principles” and Washington wants movement toward a “market-oriented” system.  That echoes complaints by foreign companies that despite a 2013 pledge by the ruling party to give market forces a “decisive role,” restrictions on them in some industries are increasing. That led to a 1.2 percent fall in foreign investment in China in the first seven months of this year, breaking a series of annual double-digit gains.  Business groups have warned that Beijing’s efforts to shield its fledgling competitors in electric cars, clean power and other fields are fueling a backlash against globalization.  A possible U.S. response might be “closing down certain industry sectors that are now open to Chinese investment,” said Zarit. “I know we do not want to see any kind of a tit-for-tat, which could end up in a trade war.”  For its part, Beijing is pressing Washington and the European Union to grant “market economy” status to its state-dominated system. That would make it harder for trading partners to bring anti-dumping and other cases against China.  China says that when it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, it was promised that status would take effect last December. The United States, Europe and Japan reject that and say Beijing has yet to meet market-opening goals to qualify.  Chinese economists argue their country isn’t to blame for U.S. problems. They say global companies benefit from low-cost Chinese labor and a growing consumer market.  The loss of American factory jobs is due not to Chinese exports but to U.S. manufacturers moving to lower-wage countries, said Sun Lijian, an economist at Shanghai’s Fudan University.  “In the end, it is U.S. companies that have gained large profits,” said Sun.  Trump temporarily set aside trade complaints in April after meeting Xi for the first time in Florida and said he hoped Beijing would help discourage North Korea from pursuing nuclear weapons. They issued a “100-Day Plan” under which Beijing agreed to discuss expanding market access for electronic payments and financial services.  Despite renewed criticism on trade, “the U.S. needs continued Chinese cooperation” over North Korea, economist Rajiv Biswas of IHS Markit said in an email.  That means Trump will feel compelled to negotiate instead of using “blunt bilateral trade measures that could endanger the overall bilateral geopolitical relationship,” said Biswas.  Potential options for a possible new package of immediate measures include raising Chinese ownership limits in fields including securities, in which foreign firms can own only 49 percent of a venture, said Zarit.  “If you raised it to 51 percent, I think that would be progress,” he said.  China criticized Trump’s order in September to investigate whether Beijing violates its free-trade commitments by pressing foreign companies to hand over technology in return for market access. They complained that Trump was jeopardizing the global system by launching the probe under U.S. law instead of the World Trade Organization.  Few American companies have provided evidence for the investigation, possibly due to fear of Chinese retaliation.  The U.S. Commerce Department also is investigating whether Chinese exports including metal tubing, industrial resin and polyester fiber benefit from improper subsidies.  Trade is a smaller share of China’s economy than it was a decade ago and the U.S. market is losing importance for its exporters as sales to other developing markets grow. That blunts the potential impact of American tariffs or other sanctions, but the United States still accounts for about one-third of China’s trade surplus, and export industries employ millions of workers.  “The U.S. does have leverage to realistically threaten to damage China’s economic prospects,” said BMI Research’s Davies.",3.7,10,"[4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.0, 2.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5]"

Trump is on a five-country trip through Asia traveling to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)  BEIJING (AP) — The standoff over North Korea’s nuclear weapons and demands that China do more to balance trade with America will dominate President Donald Trump’s agenda in Beijing.  Trump’s meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping will be grander than their informal April talks at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. That visit was most memorable for Trump informing Xi about ordering a missile strike on Syria while they ate a dessert of chocolate cake.  Officials from both sides say Trump has forged a personal connection with Xi, and Chinese officials have said they expect the leaders to continue to have “in-depth, constructive, friendly and productive” talks.  Xi was named last month to a second five-year term as the leader of China’s Communist Party at a congress that elevated his status as China’s most powerful leader in decades. In a recent interview, Trump likened Xi to “a king.”  A look at the thorny issues the two leaders will likely discuss:  ___  NORTH KOREA  China is North Korea’s chief trading partner and source of aid and diplomatic support, and Trump has pressed for Beijing to take more forceful measures against Pyongyang.  China has already agreed to tough new U.N. penalties that would substantially cut foreign revenue for the isolated North. It has ordered North Korean-owned businesses and ventures with Chinese partners to close by early January. China also has promised to cut off gas and limit shipments of refined petroleum products, effective Jan. 1.  Beijing, however, adamantly opposes steps that could bring down North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un’s government. Thus China has made no mention of crude oil, which makes up the bulk of Chinese energy supplies to North Korea and is not covered by U.N. sanctions.  China argues that sanctions alone cannot solve the impasse, and has urged Washington to cool its rhetoric and open a dialogue with North Korea. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters last month that Washington has lines of communication to Pyongyang.  ___  TRADE  Trump wants to narrow China’s trade surplus with the United States, which stood at $347 billion in 2016, but has yet to say what he might propose this week.  Washington has raised duties on Chinese goods including stainless steel and plywood to offset what it says are improper subsidies and is investigating whether Beijing improperly pressures foreign companies to hand over technology.  Some American companies worry that Trump’s focus on trade in goods might mean he pays too little attention to other issues such as Chinese rules that limit their presence in finance, health care and other service industries.  Chinese officials have rejected U.S. accusations that China engages in predatory policies at the expense of its neighbors.  ___  SOUTH CHINA SEA  China and the U.S. are at odds over Beijing’s military buildup, island-building and assertive claims to disputed islands in the South China Sea.  Washington has criticized such moves and says it has a national interest in freedom of navigation in sea lanes critical for world trade. Tillerson said last month that China’s “provocative actions” in the waters are a challenge to international law and norms.  But China says the U.S. has no territorial claim in those waters and should let countries in the region manage their own disputes.  “I think it would certainly be better if others, including the United States, would not try to interfere in this constructive process,” China’s ambassador to the U.S., Cui Tiankai, told reporters in Washington last week.  ___  MARKET ACCESS, DATA CONTROLS  The American Chamber of Commerce in China wants Beijing to ease market barriers such as limits on foreign ownership of enterprises in finance and other industries.  The chamber has called for faster approval of new seeds and agriculture-related biotechnology. Foreign business groups express concern that Chinese plans for government-led development of electric cars and other technology will limit their presence in emerging industries.  U.S. companies also say increasing Chinese restrictions on internet use, the movement of data and the use of foreign security technology hamper their business and give local competitors an unfair advantage.  Foreign business groups have appealed to Beijing to scale back or scrap rules that Chinese officials say will safeguard national security and personal privacy but that companies warn might weaken data protections. Trump has yet to say what action his government might take.  Twitter is among the platforms blocked by Chinese censors.

He was 88. (NASA via AP)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Apollo 12 astronaut Richard “Dick” F. Gordon Jr., one of a dozen men who flew around the moon but didn’t land there, has died, NASA said. He was 88.  Gordon was a test pilot when he was chosen for NASA’s third group of astronauts in 1963. He flew on Gemini 11 in 1966, walking in space twice. In 1969, Gordon circled the moon in the Apollo 12 command module Yankee Clipper while crewmates Alan Bean and Charles Conrad landed and walked on the lunar surface.  Over the two flights, he spent nearly 316 hours in space.  “Dick will be fondly remembered as one of our nation’s boldest flyers, a man who added to our own nation’s capabilities by challenging his own. He will be missed,” acting NASA administrator Robert Lightfoot said in a statement Tuesday.  Gordon died Monday at his home in San Marcos, California, according to the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation.  Born in Seattle, a Navy captain and a chemist, Gordon was such a steely professional that after a difficult first spacewalk, he fell asleep during a break in his second spacewalk. He downplayed Apollo 12 being hit by lightning during liftoff; backup batteries saved the crew from having to abort the mission.  “He’s a cool guy,” Bean recalled Tuesday. “He’s the kind of guy you want when you go to the moon.”  In a 1997 NASA oral history, Gordon said people would often ask if he felt alone while his two partners walked on the moon. “I said, ‘Hell no, if you knew those guys, you’d be happy to be alone’.”  Gordon called that experience wonderful: “You don’t have to communicate. You don’t have to worry about pleasing anyone beside yourself. And there’s a lot of things that you have to do and accomplish. And it’s a moment of solitude.”  Gordon and Bean described the second moon landing as a mission full of antics and dust.  When Conrad and Bean left the moon and docked their lunar module, Gordon said he looked in and “all I could see was a black cloud in there. I didn’t see them at all. I looked in there and said, ‘Holy smoke. You’re not getting in here and dirtying up my nice clean Command Module.’ So they passed the rocks over, took off their suits and underwear, and I said, ‘OK, you can come in now’.”  Gordon had been slated to command the Apollo 18 mission that would land on the moon, but it was cut for budget reasons. Apollo 17 was the last mission to the moon. In all, 24 Americans flew to the moon and 12 landed on it.  While in the Navy as a test pilot, Gordon won the Bendix Trophy Race from Los Angeles to New York in 1961, setting a speed record of 869.74 miles per hour.  Gordon was the instant leader of a star-studded class of 14 astronauts that included Apollo 11′s Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins and the last man on the moon, Eugene Cernan, Bean recalled.  “He was a happy guy and just the best possible crewmate and friend,” he said.  During his first Gemini 11 spacewalk, Gordon said he and crewmate Conrad “were so jacked up” that they were ready an hour early. When it came time to put on his helmet, it wouldn’t fit. After much effort and lost time, he got it on, but was exhausted and behind schedule.  “I was perspiring,” he later recalled. “My eyes were stinging ... they decided to quit.”  His second spacewalk was so calm that he and Conrad caught themselves falling asleep.  “It was nice and warm and cuddly,” Gordon said.  After retiring from NASA in 1972, he became executive vice president of the New Orleans Saints football team. He went on to be an executive in energy and science companies.  Gordon is survived by six children, two stepchildren and five grandchildren.",4.75,2,"[5.0, 4.5]"

Air pollution in India's capital has hit hazardous levels prompting local officials to ask that school shut down and a half marathon scheduled later in November be called off. (AP Photo/Manish Swarup)  NEW DELHI (AP) — A thick gray haze enveloped India’s capital on Tuesday as air pollution hit hazardous levels, prompting local officials to ask that schools shut down and a half marathon scheduled for later in November be called off.  The readings of the government’s air quality index hovered between 350 and 450, indicating that the health impact of breathing the air was “severe.” The highest reading on the Central Pollution Control Board’s index is 500. The pollutants on Tuesday that had the maximum impact on the reading were PM 2.5 and PM 10 particulate matter.  As winter approaches, a thick, soupy smog routinely envelops most parts of northern India, caused by dust, the burning of crops, emissions from factories and the burning of coal and piles of garbage as the poor try to keep warm.  Over the past two years, New Delhi has earned the dubious distinction of being one of the world’s most polluted cities.  On Tuesday, Belgium’s King Philippe and Queen Mathilde, in India on a weeklong state visit, inspected a military guard of honor at the sprawling presidential palace in New Delhi under a cover of smog that hampered visibility.  As the haze settled over the city in the morning, many people covered their faces and noses with scarves to try to protect themselves. Arvind Kejriwal, the capital’s top elected official, asked the education department to consider closing down schools.  The Indian Medical Association said New Delhi was in the midst of a “public health emergency” and appealed to the city government to halt sports and other outdoor activities in schools. The association also said the Delhi Half Marathon, scheduled for Nov. 19, was likely to leave those participating especially badly hit because the air quality is worst during the early part of the day, when the run takes place.  The sharp drop in air quality is most dangerous for the elderly, children and those already suffering from respiratory ailments. Constant exposure to pollution also reduces lung functionality for healthy adults over a period of time.  According to a recent report by the Lancet medical journal on the impact of pollution across the world, one out of every four premature deaths in India in 2015, or some 2.5 million, was attributed to pollution.  Delhi has struggled with putting in place pollution control measures over the last two years. It has tightened vehicle and factory emission norms and reduced the number of cars on the roads on the worst-hit days. But it’s had a hard time enforcing laws about crop burning, garbage fires and construction dust.  Kejriwal said on Twitter on Tuesday that his government had written to ministers in the neighboring states of Punjab and Haryana demanding an end to crop burning there, but that little had been done.  “All of us together have to find a (solution) to this,” he tweeted, adding that the city becomes a “gas chamber for almost a month” every year.",4.5,1,[4.5]
1526,3194,11,7,2017,2017-11-07,Associated Press News,"Kenya male lions seen in intimate act; bonding, experts say"," Recent photos taken in a Kenyan wildlife area show a rare sight: a male lion mounting another male lion in what resembles a sexual act but is possibly a way of showing dominance.  The spectacle of two wild male lions in such intimacy was also observed in Botswana last year and has sometimes been interpreted as homosexual behavior, though lion experts say it is a relatively uncommon form of bonding or social interaction.  Paul Goldstein, the photographer who captured the images in Kenya’s Maasai Mara reserve in August, said many other species are known to engage in such behavior and that, for example, he had seen giraffes doing it.  “It was just a dramatic thing to see,” Goldstein said of the male lions. He said he was astonished by a Kenyan media report in which Ezekiel Mutua, a Kenyan official, said the lion behavior was “not normal” and made remarks critical of homosexuality.  Wild male lions have only mounted each other for a day or two in past cases that were observed, and the activity happens “during periods of social stress or a realignment of their dominance relationship,” said Craig Packer, director of a lion research center at the University of Minnesota.  “There have been several observations of male lions mounting each other without intromission, and the males subsequently resumed their normal patterns of mating with receptive females,” Packer wrote in an email to The Associated Press.  “Male lions form stable coalitions and they are very affectionate with each other, but this affection is expressed by rubbing their heads together, licking each other’s faces and flopping on top of each other,” he wrote.  Another lion expert said cases of male lions mounting each other are “typically infrequent” and that he interprets it as a form of social bonding.  “Male lions have to commit to supporting each other when a territory is challenged, so maybe at times of territory take-over males are stressed and more likely to” engage in such an act, said Paul Funston, senior director of lion and cheetah programs at the Panthera conservation group.  In a blog post last year, Funston noted that a photographer documented similar behavior by two male lions that had traveled from Namibia to Botswana, and he described it as “remarkable but not unheard of behavior that was misunderstood by many.”  Ian Michler, maker of a documentary film called “Blood Lions,” said lions “have been known to ‘mate’ as a way of showing dominance of other males” in a group, particularly a new one.  While the lions photographed in Kenya and Botswana were confirmed to be male, Michler also remarked that some female lions with high testosterone levels grow manes, often don’t produce offspring and might be mistaken for males.  ___  Follow Christopher Torchia on Twitter at www.twitter.com/torchiachris",5.0,1,[5.0]
1558,3226,11,9,2017,2017-11-09,Associated Press News,"US and them: America, the elephant in room at climate talks","US and them: America, the elephant in room at climate talks  WASHINGTON (AP) — How’s this for awkward? The United States has a delegation at international climate talks in Bonn that will be telling other nations what they should do on an agreement that the president wants no part of.  President Donald Trump has promised to withdraw the U.S. from the 2015 Paris climate pact where nations set their own goals to reduce the emissions of heat-trapping gases, but because of legal technicalities America can’t get out until November of 2020.  “It’s like having a guest at a dinner party who complains about the food but stays anyway,” said Nigel Purvis, who worked climate issues in the State Department for Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush — and dealt with a similar situation.  In 2001 Purvis was a climate negotiator for the U.S. State Department when the new president, George W. Bush, had pulled out of a landmark global warming agreement the previous administration had championed.  The U.S. position is not just awkward, it’s potentially bad for the environment, scientists say.  Most of the Bonn meeting will be coming up with rules on how countries report emissions of heat-trapping gases and how transparent they are. The United States used to be the leading force in pushing for tougher rules and more openness, Purvis and other experts said. The rules probably won’t be as strong now, Purvis said.  “If it’s left to Chinese leadership, which is what’s left, you will have less transparency,” said Massachusetts Institute of Technology management professor Henry Jacoby, who co-founded the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change.  The United States government is becoming increasingly isolated on climate change. On Tuesday, the Syrian government, mired in war and the last United Nations country not to sign the Paris accord, announced it would sign the pact. That means the United States will be alone when it pulls out.  State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert responded to the Syrian decision by attacking its government. “If the government of Syria cared so much about what was put in the air, then it wouldn’t be gassing its own people,” she said.  In a not-so subtle jab at Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron plans a separate “One Planet Summit” in Paris to push his “Make Our Planet Great Again” agenda on Dec. 12, the anniversary date of the climate accord. He invited more than 100 world leaders to his event, but not Trump. Instead, he invited lower level U.S. diplomats.  “The rest of the world needs to get on and negotiate ... and treat the U.S. as more of an observer in the process and the U.S. should act that way,” said Greenpeace International Director Jennifer Morgan, who has been at these negotiations for more than 20 years.  That’s not what the U.S. plans.  As meetings started on Monday, U.S. negotiator Trigg Talley said, “The president has made clear that we will engage countries on energy and climate change related issues and we look forward to working with colleagues and partners to advance the work here over these two weeks and beyond.”  The administration is hosting a panel on “the clean and efficient use of fossil fuels and nuclear power,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah said Tuesday. “It is undeniable that fossil fuels will be used for the foreseeable future, and it is in everyone’s interest that they be efficient and clean.”  Of the major fossil fuels, coal is by far the biggest climate change culprit. In 2014, coal accounted for 46 percent of the globe’s carbon dioxide emissions, but was only 29 percent of its energy supply, according to the International Energy Agency.  Three U.S. governors, some mayors, corporate leaders and students will also be attending the Bonn talks.  “We have one major major player who is on the sidelines,” California Gov. Jerry Brown told The Associated Press. “The rest of us will do everything we can to keep advancing efforts and keep doing what is needed to reduce carbon emissions. There is no time to wait.”  Former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg announced Thursday he will spend $50 million to help non-United States countries move away from coal. Bloomberg, Brown and others on Saturday will unveil a report called “America’s Pledge” on how much the United States can do without the federal government.  At a “We’re Still In” event Thursday at the climate talks, James Brainard, mayor Carmel, Indiana, joined in criticizing the Trump climate policy, saying the U.S. will cut emissions regardless of the president.  “He talks about greatness a lot,” Brainard said. “Great countries keep their word when they sign agreements. Great countries care about the condition of the planet they are going to hand off to their children and grandchildren.”  If the U.S. remains out of the Paris accord and tries to dismantle President Obama’s initiatives to curb emissions, the Earth will warm by an additional one or two tenths of a degree, said Glen Peters, a Norwegian scientist who is part of the Global Carbon Project.  Scientists say that even a few tenths of a degree of warming can have dramatic impacts on ecosystems and even day-to-day life for people.  Purivs said “countries will be frustrated and resentful” toward the Trump administration at the negotiations. But he added: “Many nations will understand the rules of the Paris agreement are going to be more important and more durable than any U.S. administration and there will be a strong desire to get it right.”  ___  Frank Jordans in Berlin, Maria Murru in Rome and Matt Lee and Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this story.  ___  Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears .

On Wednesday, Nov. 8, 2017, astronomers reported that a star 500 million light-years away exploded in 1954 and apparently again in 2014. The research confounds scientists who thought they knew how dying stars ticked. (M. Kornmesser/ESO via AP)  CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Death definitely becomes this star.  Astronomers reported Wednesday on a massive, distant star that exploded in 2014 — and also, apparently back in 1954. This is one supernova that refuses to bite the cosmic dust, confounding scientists who thought they knew how dying stars ticked.  The oft-erupting star is 500 million light-years away — one light-year is equal to 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion kilometers) — in the direction of the Big Bear constellation. It was discovered in 2014 and, at the time, resembled your basic supernova that was getting fainter.  But a few months later, astronomers at the California-based Las Cumbres Observatory saw it getting brighter. They’ve seen it grow faint, then bright, then faint again five times. They’ve even found past evidence of an explosion 60 years earlier at the same spot.  Supernovas typically fade over 100 days. This one is still going strong after 1,000 days, although it’s gradually fading.  The finding was published Wednesday in the journal Nature .  “It’s very surprising and very exciting,” said astrophysicist Iair Arcavi of the University of California, Santa Barbara who led the study. “We thought we’ve seen everything there is to see in supernovae after seeing so many of them, but you always get surprised by the universe. This one just really blew away everything we thought we understood about them.”  The supernova — officially known as iPTF14hls — is believed to have once been a star up to 100 times more massive than our sun. It could well be the biggest stellar explosion ever observed, which might explain its death-defying peculiarity.  It could be multiple explosions occurring so frequently that they run into one another or perhaps a single explosion that repeatedly gets brighter and fainter, though scientists don’t know exactly how this happens.  One possibility is that this star was so massive, and its core so hot, that an explosion blew away the outer layers and left the center intact enough to repeat the entire process. But this pulsating star theory still doesn’t explain everything about this supernova, Arcavi said.  Harvard University’s astronomy chairman, Avi Loeb, who was not involved in the study, speculates a black hole or magnetar — a neutron star with a strong magnetic field — might be at the center of this never-before-seen behavior. Further monitoring may better explain what’s going on, he said.  Las Cumbres , a global network of robotic telescopes, continues to keep watch.  Scientists do not know whether this particular supernova is unique; it appears rare since no others have been detected.  “We could actually have missed plenty of them because it kind of masquerades as a normal supernova if you only look at it once,” Arcavi said.  Nothing lasts forever — not even this super supernova.  “Eventually, this star will go out at some point,” Arcavi said. “I mean, energy has to run out eventually.”",5.0,1,[5.0]
1560,3228,11,8,2017,2017-11-08,Associated Press News,Homeland nominee questions human role in climate change,"Kirstjen Nielsen testifies during a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee hearing on her nomination to be Department of Homeland Security Secretary, Wednesday, Nov. 8, 2017, on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)  WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s choice to head the Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday that she believes climate change exists, but said she cannot determine whether humans are the primary cause.  Speaking at her Senate confirmation hearing, Kirstjen Nielsen said she is “not prepared to determine causation” on climate change.  Nielsen’s comment contradicts mainstream climate science, including a U.S. report last week that concludes the evidence of global warming is stronger than ever and that it’s “extremely likely” — meaning with 95 to 100 percent certainty — that global warming is man-made.  As head of homeland security, Nielsen would oversee a sprawling agency that leads the federal response to a range of natural disasters from wildfires to hurricanes.  Democrats criticized Nielsen’s answer, which is in line with top Trump administration officials who downplay humans’ role in climate change.  Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., said his state is “sinking” as oceans rise. He called Nielsen’s comment troubling. “Ninety-eight percent of our scientists say this is a problem and we as humans are the root cause,” Carper said.  Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., urged Nielsen to “educate yourself” about climate change, adding “What I heard in your answer is politics before science. That concerns me greatly.”  Nielsen, a former Homeland security official who now serves as deputy White House chief of staff, told the Senate Homeland Security Committee that she agrees climate change is important and said the Trump administration is revising its climate models to better respond to rising sea levels.  “I can’t unequivocally state it’s caused by humans,” she said. “There are many contributions to it.”  A 1,500-page draft report by the U.S. Global Change Research Program said global warming is already sickening, injuring and killing Americans with changes to weather, food, air, water and diseases. And it’s expected to get worse, hurting the economy, wildlife and energy supply, the report said.  On other topics, Nielsen said she agreed with former Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly — now White House chief of staff — that a U.S.-Mexico border wall is unlikely to be a physical barrier from “sea to shining sea.”  She also condemned white nationalism and refuted Islamophobia and promised to make cybersecurity a top priority.  Nielsen, a former staffer at the DHS, said the scope and pace of cyberattacks on federal networks and critical infrastructure are “continually increasing” and grow more complex and sophisticated each day. She said threats to the homeland “are too many and too varied” for any one agency to confront alone and pledged to work across government and the private sector to find solutions.  Trump nominated Nielsen last month to succeed Kelly. He and others in the administration have spoken about the geographical and logistical obstacles to building a massive wall along the border. Trump repeatedly promised during the campaign that he would build the wall and that Mexico would pay for it, but the administration is seeking billions in taxpayer dollars to finance the project.  Homeland Security has been leading the charge on implementing Trump’s aggressive immigration agenda, and Nielsen pledged to continue that work.  “I will work every day to enforce ours laws, secure our borders, coasts and waterways and protect Americans from dangerous criminals, terrorists, cyberattacks and other threats,” she said.  After Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast in 2005, Nielsen led an effort to revise disaster-response and recovery plans, work that drew praise from former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff.  But Nielsen’s involvement in Katrina came under harsh scrutiny a decade ago.  Reports issued two years later by Congress were highly critical of the Bush administration’s handling of the storm. The reports faulted the White House Homeland Security Council — where Nielsen directed preparedness and response — for failing to take the lead in staying on top of the unfolding disaster.  Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, the committee’s top Democrat, said she hopes Nielsen applies lessons learned from Katrina and other disasters to improve oversight of DHS contracting practices.",4.0,2,"[3.5, 4.5]"

(Jorge Silva/Pool Photo via AP)  DANANG, Vietnam (AP) — Trade ministers from 11 Pacific Rim countries said they reached an agreement Saturday to proceed with the free-trade Trans-Pacific Partnership deal that was in doubt after President Donald Trump abandoned it. However, an immediate formal endorsement by the countries’ leaders meeting in Vietnam appeared unlikely.  A statement issued in the early hours Saturday said an accord was reached on “core elements” of the 11-member pact. The compromise was delayed by last-minute disagreements that prevented the TPP leaders from meeting to endorse a plan on Friday.  “Ministers are pleased to announce that they have agreed on the core elements of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership,” the 11 nations said in a statement.  A news conference was scheduled for later Saturday morning Vietnam time.  Japan’s delegate to the talks, Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi, told reporters that disagreements that cropped up Friday had been resolved in five hours of talks that stretched late into the night.  “We have confirmed there was no mistake about us having reached a basic agreement,” Motegi said.  Asked by reporters if the deal had the support of Canada, whose Prime Minister Justin Trudeau did not show up for the meeting planned for Friday, Motegi said “yes.”  “Canada did agree, and that means the ‘top’ also agreed,” he said. Japanese media reported that the Japanese and Vietnamese co-chairs of the ministerial meetings would hold a news conference Saturday on the sidelines of the summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which wraps up later Saturday.  Canada’s Minister for International Commerce Francois-P Champagne said in a tweet Saturday that “after lots of work, big progress on the ‘Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership.’”  Trudeau said days earlier that Canada would not be rushed into an agreement.  New Zealand’s Trade Minister David Parker told reporters that leaders who gathered for Friday’s meeting expecting a final report on the talks were surprised by Trudeau’s absence. Late Thursday, there had been “no distance between the parties,” he said.  Despite enthusiasm for sticking with the plan following the U.S. withdrawal under Trump in January, criticism over various issues persists. Detractors of the TPP say it favors corporate interests over labor and other rights. Trudeau said days before arriving in Danang that he would not be rushed into signing an agreement that did not suit Canada’s interests.  Aspects of the trade pact have raised hackles also over a requirement that companies be allowed to sue governments for lack of enforcement of related laws.  The proposed basic agreement reached in Danang said that the ministers maintained “the high standards, overall balance and integrity of the TPP while ensuring the commercial and other interests of all participants and preserving our inherent right to regulate, including the flexibility of the parties to set legislative and regulatory priorities.”  The TPP member countries are trying to find a way forward without the U.S., the biggest economy and, before Trump took office, one of its most assertive supporters. Trump has said he prefers country-to-country deals and is seeking to renegotiate several major trade agreements to, as he says, “put America first.”  Trump reiterated his markedly different stance on trade before the 21-member APEC summit convened late Friday with a gala banquet.  The U.S. president told an APEC business conference that “we are not going to let the United States be taken advantage of anymore.” He lambasted the World Trade Organization and other trade forums as unfair to the United States and reiterated his preference for bilateral trade deals, saying “I am always going to put America first.”  Trump said he would not enter into large trade agreements, alluding to U.S. involvement in the North American Free Trade Agreement and the TPP.  In contrast, Chinese President Xi Jinping told the same group that nations need to stay committed to economic openness or risk being left behind.  The Chinese president drew loud applause when he urged support for the “multilateral trading regime” and progress toward a free-trade zone in the Asia-Pacific. China is not part of the TPP.  APEC operates by consensus and customarily issues nonbinding statements. TPP commitments would eventually be ratified and enforced by its members.  But even talks this week on a declaration to cap the APEC summit had to be extended for an extra half day as ministers haggled over wording. It’s unclear what the exact sticking points were, but officials have alluded to differences over the unequal impact more open trade has had on workers and concerns over automation in manufacturing that could leave many millions in a wide array of industries with no work to do.  As a developing country with a fast-growing export sector, this year’s host country, Vietnam, has a strong interest in open trade and access for its exports to consumers in the West. The summit is an occasion for its leaders to showcase the progress its economy has made thanks largely to foreign investment and trade. Danang, Vietnam’s third largest city, is in the midst of a construction boom as dozens of resorts and smaller hotels pop up along its scenic coastline.  APEC’s members are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, the U.S. and Vietnam.  ___  Associated Press writer Robert Gillies in Toronto contributed to this report.",3.2,5,"[2.5, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 4.0]"

Mark Warner, D-Va., speak informally on tax reform and the elections with reporters in the Senate Press Gallery at the Capitol in Washington. It’s an article of faith among Republicans that the GOP’s electoral fortunes next year hinge on whether they succeed in their longstanding dream to redraft the nation’s complex, inefficient tax code. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)  WASHINGTON (AP) — It’s an article of faith among Republicans — reinforced by the party’s drubbing in this week’s off-year elections in Virginia and New Jersey — that the GOP’s electoral fortunes next year hinge on whether they succeed in their longstanding dream to redraft the nation’s complex, inefficient tax code.  Without a win on tax reform, the argument goes, Republicans are sunk in next year’s midterm elections. Core Republican voters and donors would lose faith. GOP lawmakers would have few accomplishments to run on.  “One of the things you do have to do is pass the things that you ran on,” said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., former chair of the campaign committee for House Republicans. “The other side is already whipped up. There’s nothing you can do about that. But your own side loses faith and you get a depressed turnout. If you don’t get them done, you’re guaranteed a bad midterm.”  The head of the Republican National Committee, Ronna Romney McDaniel, said GOP voters are looking to see what Congress can achieve.  “I can’t say that’s going to be the make-or-break of 2018,” she said, adding that Republicans are “facing headwinds in the coming midterms.”  “I think it’s important that we get this done,” she added.  Democrats agree that failure on tax reform would be a political disaster for Republicans. But passing the coveted tax measure wouldn’t necessarily save them from a bad midterm. The downside risk of failure, both sides say, far exceeds the upside reward.  “Without tax reform I think we’re in the minority,” said Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho. “But that doesn’t mean it’ll save us by any stretch of the imagination. I think yesterday kind of demonstrated that.”  The pending House bill, little understood by the public, performs poorly in public opinion polls. Voters are generally unenthusiastic about tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy and are skeptical that they’ll see a tax cut.  An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll taken last month found that people by large margins believe the Trump-backed tax plan helps wealthy people and corporations. Just over four in 10 in the poll said they believe that it helps middle-income individuals and families, slightly more than the number who thinks it hurts them.  Losing Virginia GOP gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie ran on a promise of across-the-board tax cuts that failed to catch on.  “We had an experiment on tax cut politics in Virginia through Ed Gillespie’s campaign. And the tax cut gambit really fell flat,” said Geoff Garin of Hart Research, lead pollster for the campaign of the Democratic governor-elect, Ralph Northam. “If the Republicans think somehow that tax cut politics will heal their problems of having to run with Donald Trump and all the damage they’ve already done to themselves on health care, the laboratory experiment we had in Virginia yesterday makes it very clear that that will not happen for them.”  The tax measure, at least as currently drafted by House Republicans, would impose tax increases on many of the affluent suburban voters who just turned against Republicans not only in Virginia, but in New Jersey and New York’s Westchester and Nassau Counties. The measure would repeal a number of deductions cherished by upper middle-income taxpayers, including the state income tax deduction, while limiting the deductibility of mortgage interest on home loans exceeding $500,000.  “Look, it’s a lose-lose for them,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. “I think even if they pass the bill, as people learn all the things that are taken away it’s going to hurt them. But I think if they can’t pass a bill their ability to get things done is questioned, even by the deep Trump supporters. So it’s a lose-lose.”  Schumer has been urging Republicans to follow the model of the successful 1986 tax reform bill, in which former President Ronald Reagan worked with both Democrats and Republicans to gore special interest provisions while lowering tax rates.  Two weeks after Reagan signed the bill, however, Republicans suffered a drubbing in the 1986 midterms, losing control of the Senate with an eight-seat loss.  In the aftermath of Tuesday’s drubbing, Republicans sought to portray an air of calm, cautioning against reading too much into the results in two states — Virginia and New Jersey — that went for Democrat Hillary Clinton in last year’s election. They said that passage of their tax overhaul bill would pay off.  “I think that’s going to bear fruit politically, but most importantly it’s going to help people,” said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., at a Wednesday morning event held by The Washington Examiner. “If anything, this just puts more pressure on making sure we follow through.”  Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said of Virginia: “I see it as a blue state staying blue.”  ___  Associated Press writer Tom Beaumont in Des Moines, Iowa, contributed to this report.",2.8333333333333335,6,"[0.5, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.5]"

(AP Photo/Minh Hoang)  DANANG, Vietnam (AP) — President Donald Trump is just one of 21 leaders attending the annual Pacific Rim summit that begins Friday in the scenic coastal city of Danang, Vietnam.  Trump’s withdrawal from a regional trade pact and his preference for country-to-country deals are at odds with the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum’s longstanding mission to fight protectionism. But the group will strive to find ways to demonstrate unity on some important issues, including concerns over North Korea’s nuclear program.  TRADE  As a regional economic forum, the 21-member APEC works from the grassroots level up to promote trade and investment across the region. The U.S. withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership was a setback for the regional effort to create a framework for an eventual regional free trade area. But the remaining 11 TPP members are working toward a new deal that can move ahead without the U.S., while other regional trade deals are also under negotiation. On trade, Trump may find himself sidelined as other leaders push ahead with their multi-country talks on opening markets.  ___  NORTH KOREA  Trump arrives straight from Beijing, where he was lobbying North Korea’s chief trading partner and source of aid and diplomatic support to take more forceful measures against Pyongyang.  North Korea’s nuclear program is seen as a threat to regional security and stability, the underpinnings of the region’s fast growth and growing affluence. The APEC leaders will likely share agreement on the need for a strong statement in support of diplomatic dialogue while urging Pyongyang to cease provocative actions like testing ballistic missiles.  China argues that sanctions alone cannot solve the impasse, and has urged Washington to cool its rhetoric and open a dialogue with North Korea. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters last month that Washington has lines of communication to Pyongyang. North Korea is not an APEC member.  ___  SOUTH CHINA SEA  In past years, the cordial atmosphere of the mostly economic-oriented APEC summits has been strained at times by tensions between China and the U.S. over Beijing’s military buildup, island-building and assertive claims to disputed islands in the South China Sea.  China says the U.S. has no territorial claim in those waters and should let countries in the region manage their own disputes.  Washington remains critical of such moves, saying it has a national interest in freedom of navigation in sea lanes critical for world trade. Tillerson said last month that China’s “provocative actions” in the waters are a challenge to international law and norms.  APEC summits generally tend to skate around this issue.  ___  REALMS OF INFLUENCE  As the largest economies in APEC, the U.S., China and Japan tend to exert significant influence over the forum’s agenda and activities. It’s unclear if Trump will seek a strong leadership role at the summit, where talks on the sidelines tend to make more news than the event itself.  APEC’s decisions are by consensus and are non-binding. The forum serves mainly as a way to help integrate the disparate economies that span the vast Pacific Rim, from wealthy Japan, Canada and the U.S. to developing countries like Vietnam, the Philippines and Papua New Guinea.",4.5,1,[4.5]
1564,3232,11,10,2017,2017-11-10,Associated Press News,White House: No formal Trump-Putin meeting on Asia trip,"President Donald Trump arrives at Danang International Airport, Friday, Nov. 10, 2017, in Danang, Vietnam. Trump is on a five country trip through Asia traveling to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)  DANANG, Vietnam (AP) — President Donald Trump will not have a formal sit-down with Russian President Vladimir Putin while the two attend a summit, the White House said Friday shortly before Trump landed in Vietnam, the fourth stop on his first official visit to Asia.  Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force Once, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders blamed scheduling conflicts on both sides for the fact that the leaders will not meet formally during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit taking place in the coastal city of Danang.  But Sanders said it was “possible” and “likely” that they could have a less formal encounter, either in Danang or later in the Philippines when Trump and Putin attend another regional conference.  “Now, they’re going to be in the same place. Are they going to bump into each other and say hello? Certainly possible and likely,” she said. “But in terms of a scheduled, formal meeting, there’s not one on the calendar and we don’t anticipate that there will be one.”  U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had told reporters in Beijing on Thursday that there was no reason to schedule a meeting if the U.S. and Russia are unable to make significant progress on issues including Syria and Ukraine.  US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping agree on the need to implement all United Nations Security Council resolutions on North Korea. (Nov. 9)  “The view has been if the two leaders are going to meet, is there something sufficiently substantive to talk about that would warrant a formal meeting,” he said.  Both sides have been working to reach agreement on how they hope to resolve Syria’s civil war once the Islamic State group is defeated. The potential understanding comes as an array of forces are near a final defeat of IS, the extremist group that once controlled vast stretches of both Iraq and Syria. Fighting the group is no longer top priority, shifting the focus back to Syria’s intractable conflict between Russian-backed President Bashar Assad’s government and armed rebels, to whom the U.S. lends at least rhetorical support.  The news comes a day after Trump set aside his blistering rhetoric in favor of friendly overtures to China on Thursday, trying to flatter his hosts into establishing a more balanced trade relationship and doing more to blunt North Korea’s nuclear ambitions.  Winding down his two days in Beijing, Trump suggested that if the U.S. and China jointly took on the world’s problems, “I believe we can solve almost all of them, and probably all of them.”  In the name of furthering that relationship, Trump largely shelved his campaign complaints about China, at least in public. He focused on exhorting Beijing to help with North Korea, an effort expected again to take center stage at an international summit in Vietnam on Friday.  The Chinese rolled out a lavish welcome for the American president. Trump returned the kindness, heaping praise on China’s Xi Jinping and predicting the two powers would work around entrenched differences. On Twitter later, Trump called his meetings with Xi “very productive on both trade and the subject of North Korea.”  On trade, Trump criticized the “very one-sided and unfair” relationship between the U.S. and China. But unlike his approach during the campaign, when he castigated China for what he contended were inappropriate trade practices, Trump said Thursday that he didn’t blame the Chinese for having taken advantage of the U.S.  Trump said China “must immediately address the unfair trade practices” that drive a “shockingly” large trade deficit, along with barriers to market access, forced technology transfers and intellectual property theft.  “But I don’t blame China,” he said. “After all, who can blame a country for being able to take advantage of another country for the benefit of its citizens?”  To applause, Trump said, “I give China great credit.”  Reacting from afar, Sen. Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, said Trump’s comments “make the United States look weak and as if we are bowing to China’s whim. ... Instead of giving China credit for stealing American jobs, the president should be holding China accountable.” Menendez, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is on trial for alleged bribery.  Tillerson offered a blunt assessment of China’s trade surplus with the United States, which in October widened by 12.2 percent from a year earlier to $26.6 billion. The total surplus with the United States for the first 10 months of the year was $223 billion.  “I think the best way to characterize it is that while we appreciate the long hours and the effort that our Chinese counterparts have put into those trade discussions, quite frankly in the grand scheme of a $300- to $500-billion trade deficit, the things that have been achieved are pretty small,” Tillerson told reporters in Beijing.  Tillerson also acknowledged there were differences in “tactics and the timing and how far to go with pressure” on North Korea. But he insisted that the two countries shared common objectives.  “There is no disagreement on North Korea,” he said.  The comments by Trump and his top diplomat came after lengthy meetings with Xi. The day included announcements that the U.S. and China had signed agreements valued at more than $250 billion for products including U.S.-made jet engines, auto parts, liquefied natural gas and beef.  Such contract signings, a fixture of foreign leaders’ visits to Beijing, are intended to defuse complaints about China’s trade policies.  Xi promised a more open business environment for foreign companies in China and said his country was committed to further opening its economy to outside investment.  “China will not close its doors” and will open them “even wider,” he said, pledging that foreign companies in China, including American ones, would find the market “more open, more transparent and more orderly.”  It is unclear how far China will go to fulfill its pledges. Previous U.S. administrations have hailed market-opening promises only to be left disappointed.  Before arriving in China, Trump had delivered a stern message to Beijing, using an address in South Korea to call on China, North Korea’s biggest trade partner, to do more to confront and isolate the North.  Trump appeared far more conciliatory on Thursday, thanking China for its efforts and saying he’d been encouraged by his conversations.  “China can fix this problem easily. And quickly. And I am calling on China and your great president to hopefully work on it very hard,” Trump said. “If he works on it hard it will happen.”  ___  Associated Press writers Christopher Bodeen in Beijing and Darlene Superville and Ken Thomas in Washington contributed to this report.  ___  Follow Colvin on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@colvinj and Lemire at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire",4.0,1,[4.0]

Sweeping victories in Virginia and key gains in other state legislative elections this year have made Democrats optimistic about the potential for even bigger wins next year as they seek a greater voice ahead of the next round of political redistricting. (David B. Hollingsworth/The Virginian-Pilot via AP)  Sweeping Democratic victories in Virginia and key gains in other 2017 state legislative races have lifted Democratic hopes of even bigger wins in next year’s midterm elections, as they seek a greater voice in how political districts will be redrawn for the decade to come.  Democrats won the governors’ offices in Virginia and New Jersey on Tuesday, erased a previously dominant Republican majority in the Virginia House of Delegates and won a special election that gave them control of the Washington state Senate.  All told, Democrats flipped about two dozen state legislative seats around the country Tuesday and have now gained at least 30 seats previously held by Republicans since President Donald Trump won election last year, reversing several years of Republican momentum.  “In general, this is a rebuke of Republican governance of states,” said Jessica Post, executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. She added: “The other thing it said is we can win all across the country.”  The fight for control of legislative chambers matters not only for policies on health care, taxes and education, but also because the legislature in most states determines how future congressional and state legislative districts are drawn. The next round of redistricting will take place after the 2020 Census, and both parties are focused on controlling as many states as possible by then.  Republicans swept to power in many states in the 2010 elections, just in time to use their new authority during the last round of redistricting. Since then, Republicans have gained more than 900 state legislative seats nationwide.  This year’s Democratic victories are “a very small step forward” by comparison and have largely come in “seats, that by all rights, they probably should have had already,” said Matt Walter, president of the Republican State Leadership Committee.  Heading into Tuesday’s elections, Republicans controlled more than two-thirds of all state legislative chambers, including full control of both chambers and the governor’s office in about two dozen states. By comparison, Democrats had complete control in only a half-dozen states. Just five states had legislatures where each party controlled one chamber, and several of those involved bipartisan coalitions.  During the past year, Democrats have launched a coordinated effort to chip away at Republican dominance from lower-level offices on up. It’s been aided by the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, which is chaired by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder.  Democratic Party leaders pointed to Tuesday’s results as the fruits of their revamped strategy.  Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez told reporters on a conference call that 33 groups worked in Virginia to help elect Democrats, doubling the number of voter contacts from four years ago. Various Democratic entities poured millions of dollars into races there and elsewhere.  Democrat Ralph Northam won the Virginia governor’s race, and Democrats whittled the Republicans’ 66-34 House majority down to a near even split with several races still too close to call. Most of the Democrats’ gains came in districts that had voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton over Trump in last year’s elections.  The Democratic legislative candidates were aided by a large voter turnout in the governor’s race. Anti-Trump sentiment motivated lot of voters who previously didn’t take an interest in governor’s races, Republican consultant Chris Jankowski, an architect of the GOP’s 2010 REDMAP redistricting project, told attendees Wednesday at a Harvard University redistricting conference.  Democrats would have won even more Virginia House seats had the districts not been gerrymandered so heavily in favor of Republicans, said Kelly Ward, executive director of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee.  “It shouldn’t take tsunami-level elections in order to maybe tie — maybe — in the House of Delegates,” Ward said at the Harvard conference.  Nonetheless, Democrats say the large swing in Virginia shows it’s possible for them to flip other chambers next year, including the Colorado Senate, Michigan House and both chambers of the Minnesota Legislature.  Democrat Phil Murphy’s victory in Tuesday’s race for New Jersey governor, replacing termed-out Republican Gov. Chris Christie, means Democrats will hold the trifecta of the chief executive office and both legislative chambers, where they picked up even more seats Tuesday.  Democrats also regained control of both houses of the Washington state Legislature, when Manka Dhingra won a special election that flipped the balance of power in the state Senate. More than $8.7 million was spent on the race, including about $5.9 million by third-party groups. That made it the most expensive legislative contest in the state’s history.  In special elections in Georgia, Democrats claimed three seats previously held by Republicans — all three in suburban areas.  GOP strategist Chip Lake, a Georgia-based political consultant, said Republicans “are hemorrhaging college-educated voters in the suburbs” but added that Democrats also face hurdles revealed by their 2016 losses and should be careful about celebrating too much.  For Republicans to bounce back nationally, it will be crucial for the GOP-led Congress to pass a tax overhaul and address problems surrounding health care, he said.  “Absent that, what we saw yesterday could be a precursor of what happens in 2018,” Lake said.  ___  Follow David A.

The event takes place on the anniversary of the election that put Trump in the White House. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya)  DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Marking a year since President Donald Trump’s election, his fiercest advocates offered different approaches Wednesday for the Republican Party’s way forward after some tough losses Tuesday.  Appearing in key states Trump carried a year ago, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer and Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel called on Republicans to come together, while former White House strategist Steve Bannon maintained an aggressive tone toward any in the GOP who would stand in the president’s way.  Their remarks in Iowa and Michigan underscored the tension bubbling over in Washington.  “Let me tell you, there is a stark difference between the worst Republican and the best Democrat,” Spicer said during the Republican Party of Iowa’s annual Reagan Dinner in Des Moines.  Spicer lamented Republicans in Virginia who decided not to vote Tuesday for GOP gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie because he didn’t pass their “litmus tests.”  Bannon, meanwhile, took aim at veteran Republican lawmakers and entrenched party insiders, whom he has pledged to root out of the Senate next year. He grouped Gillespie — a lobbyist, former RNC chairman and adviser to former President George W. Bush — with the GOP forces of old.  Trump needs more outsiders at his side, Bannon said.  “He’s had some victories. He’s had some defeats,” Bannon said of Trump. “Most of the defeats are because the Republican establishment cannot execute on the plan.”  Bannon spoke at a Republican dinner in Macomb County, Michigan, a working-class Detroit suburb which former President Barack Obama carried twice but where Trump handily beat Democrat Hillary Clinton last year.  Despite Trump’s low approval ratings — 33 percent in a Gallup poll this week, the lowest of his presidency — McDaniel, who also spoke at the Iowa banquet, painted an optimistic picture of the economy, touted record party fundraising and said, “I feel very confident in the candidates I see running across the country.”  “I hope we expand our majority in the Senate so we can get more things done,” she said.  However, Bannon has pledged to find primary opponents for virtually every Republican senator standing for re-election next year, arguing they have not adequately defended Trump against attacks from within his own party, chiefly by Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker and Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake.  With Corker and Flake having announced plans to not seek re-election, Bannon is gunning for GOP Sen. Dean Heller in Nevada and has even mentioned challenging reliable conservatives such as John Barrasso of Wyoming and Deb Fischer of Nebraska.  One of Bannon’s chief goals is ousting Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, whom he blames for not following through on long-promised legislation to undo Obama’s 2010 health care law.  “They only understand one thing. You cannot be nice to these guys,” Bannon said, referring to McConnell. “You have to drop the hammer. That’s what he understands.”  ___  Eggert reported from Warren, Michigan.",4.166666666666667,3,"[4.5, 5.0, 3.0]"

(Thomas Peter/Pool Photo via AP)  BEIJING (AP) — China took what it called a major step toward opening its financial industry with a promise Friday to ease limits on foreign ownership of banks and securities firms following a visit by U.S. President Donald Trump that was dominated by trade issues.  The announcement by a Cabinet official appeared to respond to mounting U.S. and European complaints that Beijing hampers foreign activity in a variety of industries in violation of free-trade commitments. The American Chamber of Commerce in China, which has appealed to Beijing to ease market barriers, said it looked forward to seeing details of the latest changes.  The announcement followed a series of multibillion-dollar contract signings with American companies during Trump’s visit in a tradition aimed at blunting criticism of Beijing’s trade surpluses and market barriers.  China will lift its limit on foreign ownership of securities, fund management and futures companies from a minority stake of 49 percent to a majority stake of 51 percent and end restrictions after three years, the official, Zhu Guangyao, said at a news briefing. He said a similar change would be made for life insurance companies and those would end in five years.  Regulators also will abolish restrictions that limit a single foreign investor’s stake in a Chinese bank to 20 percent and cap total foreign ownership of any institution at 25 percent, Zhu said.  “In other words, foreign owners can have full ownership of such companies” after three to five years, he said. “This opening up is decisive and the effect will be far-reaching.”  Beijing will also gradually reduce tariffs on automotive imports, Zhu said, without providing details.  The announcement came hours after Trump left Beijing to attend an Asia-Pacific economic meeting in Danang, Vietnam.  Asked about the timing of the changes announced Friday, Zhu cited President Xi Jinping’s comments at the ruling Communist Party’s twice-a-decade congress last month. Xi promised freer markets but also emphasized that Beijing wants to build up state-owned companies that dominate finance, energy and other industries.  American, European and other foreign companies complain that despite official pledges to open China’s economy, they are hampered by ownership limits and other restrictions in finance, health care and other promising industries.  “I look forward to seeing the details, as opening up the financial sector in particular could greatly improve the allocation of financial resources and support China’s future development,” William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber, said in an email. “These restrictions, and many others yet to be addressed, have been hindering economic activity in China for far too long.”  Ahead of Trump’s visit, the American Chamber had expressed concern that his focus on trade in goods might mean he paid less attention to complaints about restrictions on access to finance, health care and other industries in China’s state-dominated economy.  Trump has made narrowing the U.S. trade deficit with China — $347 billion last year — a priority. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that was a “central focus” of Trump’s talks with Xi.  Xi promised Thursday to open China’s state-dominated economy wider, but foreign companies have been disappointed when previous pledges of liberalization turned out to include restrictions that limited their impact.  For its part, Zhu said Beijing wants Washington to ease security-related export controls on high-tech goods and take action on what Beijing says is a promise to grant the country market-economy status.  China has pressed the United States for years to end controls on “dual use” technologies with both civilian and military uses such as supercomputers and advanced materials that can be used in warplanes and missiles.  Beijing says Washington and other governments agreed to grant market-economy status last year as part of China’s 2001 accession to the World Trade Organization. That would make it harder for them to bring anti-dumping and other cases against China.  The United States, the European Union, Japan and other governments reject China’s assertion and say Beijing has yet to follow through on liberalization required to qualify.  This week’s contract signings give Trump the opportunity to claim a rare political win following a first year in office marked by little legislative progress on health care and taxes.  Commerce Minister Zhong Shan said agreements signed Thursday at a ceremony attended by Trump and Xi totaled $253.4 billion, though many were memoranda of understanding or other arrangements that were less than firm contracts. Commercial sales announced appeared to total about $65 billion, many involving goods Chinese companies routinely buy.  That was on top of $9 billion in contracts signed by the two sides on Wednesday covering sales of soybeans, pork, beef and other goods.  Such contract signings are a fixture of visits to Beijing by foreign leaders and are meant to defuse trade complaints. They often represent purchases already made by Chinese mobile phone makers, airlines and other customers that are collected for the visit, which means they have little effect on the trade balance.",2.0,1,[2.0]
1579,3266,11,9,2017,2017-11-09,Associated Press News,Pacific trade pact leaders due to meet on new deal," Leaders of the countries participating in a Pacific Rim trade pact abandoned by President Donald Trump have agreed to meet and are expected to endorse a basic agreement on moving ahead without the U.S.  Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said Friday that he was “reasonably confident” the 11 countries remaining in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which include Malaysia, would have a basic agreement.  They are trying to find a way forward without the U.S., the biggest economy and before Trump took office one of its most assertive supporters. Trump has said he prefers country-to-country deals and is seeking to renegotiate several major trade agreements to, as he says, “put America First.”  Najib’s comments to a business conference on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum followed conflicting reports that a basic agreement had been reached in the wee hours Friday.  Najib said officials met until 3 a.m. Friday trying to bridge their differences and produce a statement for the leaders of their countries to endorse.  “I am quite sanguine we will get a deal but of course it has to go through a process of ratification and some side matters have to be worked out, but at least we have managed to salvage some kind of free trade agreement, which is important for the future of APEC,” Najib said.  Vietnamese officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The negotiations are being held in Danang, Vietnam, alongside meetings of the 21-member APEC’s annual summit, where Trump’s markedly different stance from past U.S. leaders was being felt even before his arrival Friday in the coastal resort city.  While most APEC members say they remain committed to their multi-country approach in weaving their economies ever closer together, many acknowledge that open trade is a mixed bag: Not everyone benefits equally.  The U.S. pushback on “free trade,” evidenced in Trump’s “America First” policy, has raised eyebrows in the region after decades of U.S. pressure on opening markets.  While APEC operates by consensus and customarily issues nonbinding statements, TPP commitments would eventually be ratified and enforced by its members.  But even talks this week on a declaration to cap this week’s APEC summit had to be extended for an extra half-day as ministers haggled over wording. It’s unclear what the exact sticking points were, but officials have alluded to differences over the unequal impact more open trade has had on workers and concerns over automation in manufacturing that could leave many millions in a wide array of industries with no work to do.  Vietnamese Trade Minister Tran Tuan Anh said a “new trend of protectionism” was afoot, but the group eventually managed to bridge their differences.  As a developing country with a fast-growing export sector, Vietnam has a strong interest in open trade and access for its exports to consumers in the West. The summit is an occasion for its leaders to showcase the progress its economy has made thanks largely to foreign investment and trade. Danang, Vietnam’s third largest city, is in the midst of a construction boom as dozens of resorts and smaller hotels pop up along its scenic coastline.  But even though its economy grew at a brisk 6.2 percent pace last year, Vietnam’s GDP per capita is still one of the lowest among APEC members at less than $2,200. Many of its 95 million people remain poor and vulnerable to natural disasters such as storms that lashed the coast near Danang just days before the APEC meetings.  APEC’s members are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, the U.S. and Vietnam.",2.0,1,[2.0]

Bill Walker addresses reporters during a news conference in Juneau, Alaska. The state of Alaska will attempt to advance a multibillion dollar natural gas pipeline project with the help of interests from China. Walker said the agreement signed late Wednesday, Nov. 8, 2017, is with Sinopec, China Investment Corp. and the Bank of China. (AP Photo/Becky Bohrer, File)  ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — The latest push in a decades-long effort to commercialize vast stores of Alaska’s natural gas got a boost when the state announced a deal with three Chinese companies. But the $43 billion project is far from reality.  The agreement advances a project to move gas through a pipeline to the Alaska coast, where it would be liquefied and shipped to China and other points in Asia. U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping looked on as Alaska’s governor and representatives from the companies signed the deal Thursday in Beijing.  But the fanfare does not ensure one shovelful of tundra gets overturned. Similar efforts to build a natural gas pipeline have fizzled repeatedly.  Here’s a look at the new project:  WHAT’S THE PLAN?  Alaska’s prodigious North Slope is known for its vast deposit of oil, which fueled construction of the 800-mile trans-Alaska oil pipeline in the 1970s. Since then, oil production has declined, and the recession-racked state hopes to tap into natural gas to fill the gaps.  The North Slope has proven gas reserves over 35 trillion cubic feet, but no way to move it. State efforts to find partners willing to shell out billions for a pipeline have flopped over the years, with major oil companies the latest to step away. Gov. Bill Walker has since courted Asian markets.  Sinopec, the Bank of China and China Investment Corp. signed on, but financial terms have not been released. Walker said 75 percent of the gas would be earmarked for China, and Alaska would keep the rest to sell to other Asian markets. The state would be the majority owner.  Walker said he wants final agreements in place by the end of next year, with groundbreaking in 2019.  The plan includes building a gas treatment plant on the North Slope, a pipeline that would go 800 miles to the town of Nikiski and a liquefaction plant there. Walker anticipates all of it to be running about five years later.  Larry Persily, former U.S. coordinator for Alaska natural gas projects, said it could cost $1 billion to get to that point, and he doesn’t think the timeline is realistic.  “But if the first tanker left the dock in 2025 instead of 2023 or 2026, everyone would still be ecstatic,” he said.  WHY DID OIL COMPANIES BACK OUT?  BP, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips had been working on the pipeline plan but backed away to concentrate on other projects. That left pipeline skeptics wondering, Persily said.  “If companies don’t think this is a good time to put their money into it, why should the state?” he said. “As the governor has explained, the state has an overriding interest in getting this done — companies have other places they can invest their money.”  The Chinese companies also don’t have the same shareholder pressures as U.S firms.  “From what I’ve seen from China, they make decisions like this and they pursue them generally to completion as a matter of strategy and are less worried about some of the short-term economics,” said Mark Barteau, director of the University of Michigan’s Energy Institute.  WHY CHINA?  It has an insatiable need for natural gas as it struggles with pollution and tries to end its reliance on coal.  “They have exhibited a long-term interest in having a large and secure gas supply, and I think this is just perhaps the largest — but by no means the first — step they’ve taken to achieve that,” said Barteau, who also serves on the science advisory board for the National Institute of Clean and Low Carbon Energy in Beijing.  Charlie Riedl, executive director of Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group the Center for Liquefied Natural Gas, sees no reason to be skeptical, saying the Chinese have wanted to get involved in a natural gas project in the U.S. for some time.  The agreement “is a really positive indicator that there is demand, and there is an appetite in Asia for this gas, and the proximity to market being in Alaska is obviously a good thing,” he said.  WHAT ARE THE DOWNSIDES?  Without seeing the details of the agreement, some analysts pointed to the large amount of gas earmarked for China and the possible terms of the deal.  Barteau said he assumes it would guarantee pricing for a set period.  “If gas prices were to go way up, and we’re locked in selling it at bargain basement prices, that wouldn’t be such a good deal down the line,” he said.  Persily said that if Alaska contracts to sell three-quarters of the gas to one nation, it would “be stuck with one big customer that you sink or swim with.”  WHAT DO ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY?  The Center for Biological Survey called the project a “massively terrible idea” and expects legal action if the Trump administration fast-tracks it or skirts permit requirements in environmental laws.  “It is just a massive investment in new fossil fuel infrastructure at a time when we should be rapidly transitioning to clean energy, and it’s just the wrong decision,” said Kristen Monsell, an attorney for the environmental group.  Her concern is not only what extracting the gas from the ground might do to the environment but also increased tanker activity through habitat of the endangered Pacific right whale.  Another environmental group didn’t foresee plans to stall the pipeline, calling it a safer option than opening up part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling, said Lois Epstein with The Wilderness Society.",3.625,4,"[3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 2.5]"

Most of the places they work are outdoor eating areas.  “What seagulls do in their aftermath when they eat, it’s pretty messy,” says Mike, 35.  Alyssa, 30, says pest birds are able to thrive in metropolitan areas because they feel safe there.  “They need shelter, food and water, and they’re finding it in these false environments basically that have sprinklers and fountains and food 24/7, but they’re also using the humans as a shield against the predators who are too scared to come in,” she says. “So by bringing in a predator that’s not afraid of people, it just ruins everything for the pigeons.”  A hawk named Riley soars between high rises in downtown Los Angeles.

1582,3269,11,9,2017,2017-11-09,Associated Press News,"US and them: America, the elephant in room at climate talks","US and them: America, the elephant in room at climate talks  WASHINGTON (AP) — How’s this for awkward? The United States has a delegation at international climate talks in Bonn that will be telling other nations what they should do on an agreement that the president wants no part of.  President Donald Trump has promised to withdraw the U.S. from the 2015 Paris climate pact where nations set their own goals to reduce the emissions of heat-trapping gases, but because of legal technicalities America can’t get out until November of 2020.  “It’s like having a guest at a dinner party who complains about the food but stays anyway,” said Nigel Purvis, who worked climate issues in the State Department for Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush — and dealt with a similar situation.  In 2001 Purvis was a climate negotiator for the U.S. State Department when the new president, George W. Bush, had pulled out of a landmark global warming agreement the previous administration had championed.  The U.S. position is not just awkward, it’s potentially bad for the environment, scientists say.  Most of the Bonn meeting will be coming up with rules on how countries report emissions of heat-trapping gases and how transparent they are. The United States used to be the leading force in pushing for tougher rules and more openness, Purvis and other experts said. The rules probably won’t be as strong now, Purvis said.  “If it’s left to Chinese leadership, which is what’s left, you will have less transparency,” said Massachusetts Institute of Technology management professor Henry Jacoby, who co-founded the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change.  The United States government is becoming increasingly isolated on climate change. On Tuesday, the Syrian government, mired in war and the last United Nations country not to sign the Paris accord, announced it would sign the pact. That means the United States will be alone when it pulls out.  State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert responded to the Syrian decision by attacking its government. “If the government of Syria cared so much about what was put in the air, then it wouldn’t be gassing its own people,” she said.  In a not-so subtle jab at Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron plans a separate “One Planet Summit” in Paris to push his “Make Our Planet Great Again” agenda on Dec. 12, the anniversary date of the climate accord. He invited more than 100 world leaders to his event, but not Trump. Instead, he invited lower level U.S. diplomats.  “The rest of the world needs to get on and negotiate ... and treat the U.S. as more of an observer in the process and the U.S. should act that way,” said Greenpeace International Director Jennifer Morgan, who has been at these negotiations for more than 20 years.  That’s not what the U.S. plans.  As meetings started on Monday, U.S. negotiator Trigg Talley said, “The president has made clear that we will engage countries on energy and climate change related issues and we look forward to working with colleagues and partners to advance the work here over these two weeks and beyond.”  The administration is hosting a panel on “the clean and efficient use of fossil fuels and nuclear power,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah said Tuesday. “It is undeniable that fossil fuels will be used for the foreseeable future, and it is in everyone’s interest that they be efficient and clean.”  Of the major fossil fuels, coal is by far the biggest climate change culprit. In 2014, coal accounted for 46 percent of the globe’s carbon dioxide emissions, but was only 29 percent of its energy supply, according to the International Energy Agency.  Three U.S. governors, some mayors, corporate leaders and students will also be attending the Bonn talks.  “We have one major major player who is on the sidelines,” California Gov. Jerry Brown told The Associated Press. “The rest of us will do everything we can to keep advancing efforts and keep doing what is needed to reduce carbon emissions. There is no time to wait.”  Former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg announced Thursday he will spend $50 million to help non-United States countries move away from coal. Bloomberg, Brown and others on Saturday will unveil a report called “America’s Pledge” on how much the United States can do without the federal government.  At a “We’re Still In” event Thursday at the climate talks, James Brainard, mayor Carmel, Indiana, joined in criticizing the Trump climate policy, saying the U.S. will cut emissions regardless of the president.  “He talks about greatness a lot,” Brainard said. “Great countries keep their word when they sign agreements. Great countries care about the condition of the planet they are going to hand off to their children and grandchildren.”  If the U.S. remains out of the Paris accord and tries to dismantle President Obama’s initiatives to curb emissions, the Earth will warm by an additional one or two tenths of a degree, said Glen Peters, a Norwegian scientist who is part of the Global Carbon Project.  Scientists say that even a few tenths of a degree of warming can have dramatic impacts on ecosystems and even day-to-day life for people.  Purivs said “countries will be frustrated and resentful” toward the Trump administration at the negotiations. But he added: “Many nations will understand the rules of the Paris agreement are going to be more important and more durable than any U.S. administration and there will be a strong desire to get it right.”  ___  Frank Jordans in Berlin, Maria Murru in Rome and Matt Lee and Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this story.  ___  Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears .

As international leaders meet in Germany for the first major global climate conference since President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. will pull out of the 2015 Paris accord, many in Africa fear they will be harder-hit than most and in Uganda's poorest region Karamoja, the changing climate has brought hunger and bewilderment as traditional coping methods fail. (AP Photo/Adelle Kalakouti)  NAMALU, Uganda (AP) — The sun is setting over Karamoja. Time for the nomadic herders to return their cattle to thorn-ringed enclosures. They’ve roamed since first light, searching for pasture in Uganda’s poorest region where water and grazing land are scarce.  Now the changing climate has brought hunger and bewilderment as traditional coping methods for the harsh environment fail. As the first major global climate conference convenes in Germany since President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. will pull out of the 2015 Paris accord, many in Africa fear they will be hit harder than most.  In Karamoja, as in many rural areas of Africa, cattle are highly valued, a source of prestige and wealth. From a young age, Karamojong men build their herds to be used as dowry for marriage. Now they look to the rainless sky in frustration.  “We have just had to bear with it because we have nowhere to go,” said 62-year-old Mudang Lowal.  In northeastern Uganda, Karamoja’s semi-arid savannah borders Kenya’s Turkana region and South Sudan. The vast region, a tenth of Uganda’s land, has seen rising temperatures for the past 35 years.  Rainfall is poor and unreliable. Long dry spells and flash floods have become more frequent in the past decade.  Historically, the rainy season runs from April to September and the dry season from November to March, creating one harvest per year. But now that pattern has changed, causing crop failures and lower milk production. The Karamojong, who had developed early warning systems for the punishing environment based on wind direction, animal behavior and the flowering of trees, now feel off-balance.  “The seasons are now different,” said Michael Lokwameri, a father of seven children.  As tradition dictates, when changes in nature are noticed, village elders gather at a local shrine to decide on a way forward.  This year, the fruitless tamarind trees tell the elders that the upcoming dry season will not be as severe as last year’s, said elder Max Adjaka during a gathering in his village in Nakapiripirit district.  Last year, more than half of Karamoja’s population, or about 640,000 people, faced food shortages. Many resorted to selling their cattle or begging in the streets. Others ate wild plants.  “It is just desperation of hunger that forces us to eat such things,” said 72-year-old Nakoki Nayep.  The region is already vulnerable after decades of political upheaval. Thirty years of widespread conflict among herders ended when Uganda’s government swept in and forced them to disarm. An estimated 82 percent of the population lives in absolute poverty, compared to the national average of 31 percent. Aid groups such as the World Food Program provided emergency food aid to Karamoja for more than 40 years.  Climate change brings more uncertainty, experts say.  “For the case of Karamoja, the increase or the rise in temperature had been taken for more than 30 years,” said William George Omony, senior meteorologist at the Uganda National Meteorological Authority. He attributed last year’s drought to the global phenomena of El Nino and La Nina, which are increasing in frequency.  Temperatures in the region are set to rise by 0.8 degrees Celsius over the next 20 years and 2.3 degrees Celsius by the end of the century if no measures are taken, the authority says. Rainfall levels also are projected to increase, by 5 percent over the next 20 years and 15 percent by the end of the century.  Despite the growing rainfall, water reserves will be compromised by the rise in temperature and evaporation, Omony said. That will lead to more disease and the disappearance of once-resilient indigenous crops.  The use of drought-resistant crops and tree planting are encouraged to help the population adapt. In Namalu, the German government-backed GIZ development agency trains the Karamojong in sustainable agricultural practices. Learning assistant Caroline Ichomot said many farmers have embraced them.  The reception by the wider community has been mixed, in part because of traditional beliefs. Some pastoralists have resisted, especially after Uganda’s government in recent years prioritized permanent settlements and crop farming. Some critics say cultural identity, including freedom of movement for cattle, must be respected.  The official in charge of programs in Karamoja for the prime minister’s office, Francis Lowoth Okori, stressed the need to abandon handouts and develop sustainable assistance to fight the region’s hunger and poverty.  After last year’s drought, Ugandan officials met with aid groups. “We said, ‘What is the problem?’ And actually, we found the problem is water,” Okori said. The next step is the construction of at least 10 more dams across Karamoja, he said.",3.8333333333333335,3,"[4.0, 3.5, 4.0]"
1595,3303,11,11,2017,2017-11-11,Associated Press News,Will Alabama pick a Democrat over Moore? Suburbs will decide,"Former Alabama Chief Justice and U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore speaks at the Vestavia Hills Public library, Saturday, Nov. 11, 2017, in Birmingham, Ala. According to a Thursday, Nov. 9 Washington Post story an Alabama woman said Moore made inappropriate advances and had sexual contact with her when she was 14. Moore has denied the allegations. (AP Photo/Brynn Anderson)  ALABASTER, Ala. (AP) — It’s no secret that if Roy Moore is going to lose his race for U.S. Senate, it’s going to happen in Alabama’s suburbs. And on Friday, a day after allegations emerged that the outspoken Christian conservative had sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl decades ago, at least a few Republicans in one Birmingham suburb were having second thoughts about their party’s nominee.  “Really and truly, I cannot tell you what I’m going to do right now,” said Carolyn Griffin, of Calera, as she watched her dog Loxy exercise at Alabaster’s Veterans Park.  Griffin is the kind of voter who might be moved by the allegations, and suburban Shelby County is where other likeminded voters are located. While Alabama might be called the Heart of Dixie, much of Shelby County is Anysuburb USA, with subdivisions and strip malls sprawling ever farther south along traffic-choked highways leading out of Birmingham.  The accusations against Moore come as Democrats are feeling increasingly optimistic about their strength in suburbs after Tuesday’s elections in Virginia, New Jersey and other races. Still, it’s a steep, steep climb in Alabama. No Democrat has held a U.S. Senate seat there since 1997, when Howell Heflin retired.  Moore has been considered the strong favorite as a Republican running in a deeply red state, and polls taken before the Washington Post story showed him with a lead over Democratic challenger Doug Jones in the Dec. 12 race.  But Moore, a polarizing figure within his own state, has typically underperformed other Republicans in general-election races, giving rise to Democrats’ hope of a victory against him in the off-year election.  “There was a universe in Alabama that was uncomfortable with him, all while Republicans were gaining in Alabama,” Birmingham-based Democratic pollster John Anzalone said. “These allegations now give these voters a reason to vote against him or stay home.”  The 70-year-old Moore, a former state Supreme Court judge, was twice removed from the Alabama Supreme Court, once for disobeying a federal court order to remove a 5,200-pound (2,359-kilogram) granite Ten Commandments monument from the lobby of the state judicial building and later for urging state probate judges to defy the U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized gay marriage.  He has vehemently denied accusations that he had sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl and pursued three other teenagers when he was an assistant district attorney in his early 30s.  He repeated his denial Saturday while speaking to the Mid Alabama Republican Club in Vestavia Hills outside Birmingham.  “There are investigations going on. In the next few days, there will be revelations about the motivations and the content of this article that will be brought to the public,” Moore said without elaborating. “We fully expect the people of Alabama to see through this charade.”  David Mowery, an Alabama-based political campaign consultant who helped run a Democrat’s unsuccessful campaign against Moore in 2012, said the allegations against Moore are damaging but aren’t necessarily a death blow.  “I think it hurts. It hurts because they are having to divert time and effort and probably money into killing it,” Mowery said. “Can they turn the page, so to speak, and turn it back to a D versus R thing?”  “There’s an old saying that the only way some candidates could lose is to be caught with a dead girl or a live boy. Alabama is going to test the specs on that like ‘Hold my beer,’” Mowery said.  The state’s eight most populous counties have almost as many people as the other 59 combined, and those are among the areas where Moore was weakest in the primary against Sen. Luther Strange, appointed to the Senate on an interim basis after Jeff Sessions was elevated to U.S. attorney general.  Former state Republican Party chairman Marty Connors said he expected the impact of the allegations to be concentrated in the suburbs.  “It will affect what I call your really, really moderate Republican voters,” Connors said.  But not everyone in the suburbs is ready to abandon Moore. Frank Pimintel of Alabaster said he viewed the allegations as part of a typical political smear campaign and wouldn’t judge Moore for something that happened more than 30 years ago.  “I’m about states’ rights, low taxes, local control. He stands for a lot of things that I believe in,” Pimintel said.  That’s more along the lines of the reaction that Connors and retired University of Alabama political science professor Bill Stewart expect rural voters to have.  “In rural Alabama, they don’t seem to be putting a lot of stock in this story,” Stewart said. “They don’t believe it.”  Connors said the accusations could even energize supporters, similar to how President Donald Trump survived audio of him bragging about groping women.  Mark Victory of Alabaster counted himself as still “tentatively in the Moore camp” after the claims.  Victory said he wants to support Trump’s agenda but might be swayed by more proof. If there is more proof, he said, his reaction would be to not vote at all.  “I’m not going to vote for his opponent,” Victory said, saying he believes Jones is too submissive to the agenda of national Democratic leaders.  But moderate Republicans not voting might not be enough for Jones, Stewart said, “given the intensity of Republican identification in Alabama.” Stewart still thinks Moore’s going to win, despite the allegations.  “I don’t think it matters enough to make Jones the favorite to win,” he said.  ___  Beaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.

According to a Washington Post story Nov. 9, an Alabama woman said Moore made inappropriate advances and had sexual contact with her when she was 14. (AP Photo/Brynn Anderson, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — An Alabama state official is citing the Bible to defend the Republican U.S. Senate candidate accused of sexual advances on girls. State auditor Jim Ziegler says “Mary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter,” suggesting that Roy Moore acted in a divine tradition if he in fact made sexual advances toward a 14-year-old girl.  Theologians and pastors, among others, expressed revulsion that Mary and Joseph would be used to counter allegations of sexual misbehavior with a minor. They also said Ziegler got the facts wrong and ignored the cultural context of the time in which Jesus lived.  “If this is evangelicalism, I’m on the wrong team,” the evangelical commentator Ed Stetzer wrote in Christianity Today. “But it is not. Christians don’t use Joseph and Mary to explain child molesting accusations.”  Moore, a 70-year-old former state Supreme Court justice, flatly denied allegations of decades-old sexual advances on girls, published Thursday in a Washington Post story. The accounts by multiple women prompted Republican lawmakers to say he should end his candidacy for the Dec. 12 special election if the allegations are true. “I have never engaged in sexual misconduct,” Moore said Friday.  But Ziegler was dismissive about the fuss. “There’s just nothing immoral or illegal here,” he told the Washington Examiner. “Maybe just a little bit unusual.”  Rev. Jim Martin, editor at large of the Jesuit magazine America, tweeted Friday that “comparing the allegations against Roy Moore in any way to Joseph and Mary is disgusting.” Martin said: “We have no idea about the exact ages of either the Virgin Mary or St. Joseph at the time of their betrothal or marriage.”  The Bible does not state the ages of Joseph and Mary, agrees Margaret M. Mitchell, a professor of early Christian literature and the New Testament at the University of Chicago Divinity School.  Under ancient norms and apparently under first century Roman and Jewish law, she said, it was apparently common for girls 12 and older to be betrothed, though practice varied by region, social class and more.  She said the earliest text to mention Mary’s age is “The Infancy Gospel of James,” which she describes as “a clearly legendary text that is trying to expand on the gospel accounts.” That non-authoritative text placed Mary’s age at 12 when she conceived and it cited supposed evidence of her enduring virginity to demonstrate she conceived Jesus without sexual intercourse.  Similarly, Mitchell said by email, “We have no idea how old the historical Joseph was, though a tradition that he was very old developed in the second century and beyond.” The point of that, too, was to support the idea of the virgin birth — Joseph perhaps being too old to impregnate Mary.  Such theories were “fanciful expansions on the Gospel narratives,” Mitchell said. But they add a “veneer of solemnity ... that may allow a modern Christian like Mr Z (Ziegler) to gloss over what it means for a 12 or 14 year old girl to be viewed as and used as a sexual vessel.”  Martin, in tweets, said: “Joseph is often depicted in art as older than Mary, in fact, considerably older, so as to make him seem less ‘sexualized,’ and to emphasize Mary’s virginity. But, in fact, both Mary and Joseph could have been the same age.”  Leigh Corfman told the Post she was 14 when Moore first approached her and took her to his home twice, the second time touching her over her bra and panties and having her touch him over his underwear. The Post quoted three other women who said he pursued them when they were 16 to 18 and he was in his early 30s. He denies the women’s reports and says he won’t quit the race.  If the Bible is not clear on the subject, the law is: Alabama’s legal age of consent then and now is 16 and adults cannot touch children sexually or entice them into a home for that purpose.  ___  AP Religion Writer Rachel Zoll contributed to this report.",2.75,2,"[0.5, 5.0]"

(AP Photo/Hau Dinh)  DANANG, Vietnam (AP) — An annual Pacific Rim summit is sticking with its tradition of promoting free trade and closer regional ties, shrugging off President Donald Trump’s “America First” approach.  The leaders of the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum said Saturday that they had recommitted to fighting protectionism and “all unfair trade practices.” They also expressed support for multi-country institutions and regional as well as country-to-country trade agreements.  Trade ministers from 11 of the Pacific Rim countries announced an agreement on pushing ahead with a free-trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, whose destiny had been cast into doubt after Trump pulled the U.S. out.  Efforts to get an agreement on how to proceed without the U.S. stumbled at the last moment, with leaders unable to formally endorse the proposal. But trade ministers announced a preliminary deal, with some details to be worked out later.  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters that environmental protection, labor rights, gender issues and the auto industry were areas needing work, though he did not go into specifics.  “We got a lot of work done, but there is still more work to do,” Trudeau said.  The revisions required for the 11 remaining TPP countries to continue talks required a difficult balance between high standards and pragmatism, said Japanese Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi.  “The substance is something all the TPP countries can agree on,” said Motegi. “This will send a very strong message to the U.S. and the other countries in the region.”  Trudeau said his unexpected absence from a TPP leaders’ meeting on Friday, which caused consternation among his fellow leaders and confusion about Canada’s stance, stemmed from an extra-long meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.  “We were not ready to close the TPP 11 yesterday,” he said.  The ministers dropped some key provisions the Americans had required on protection of intellectual property, among others. They also changed the trade accord’s name to the unwieldy Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, or CPTPP.  Those trade talks took place on the sidelines of APEC summitry: ceremonial arrivals in bright tailored shirts to a gala banquet, a closed-door retreat and scores of bilateral meetings between the 21 leaders attending the event in this coastal resort city.  Increasingly, APEC summits have become more of an opportunity for such side talks, and for host nations to showcase their growing affluence.  Trump’s dramatically different stances from his predecessor, Barack Obama — such as his “America First” trade strategy and his skepticism over climate change — were apparent in Danang. But his hosts and the other leaders took it in stride.  As an institution, apart from its pageantry and its tradition of drawing leaders together for face-to-face meetings, APEC mainly serves as a laboratory for trying out policies and encouraging “best practices,” said Alan Bollard, executive director for APEC’s secretariat. Unlike the TPP trade pact, whose decisions will eventually be enforced, APEC’s statements are nonbinding.  “We’re in an easier place to try things out, to test policy sensitivities even if we don’t get everybody around the table,” Bollard said.  The declaration issued Saturday contain calls for continued work to improve food security, to help ensure the benefits of economic growth are more evenly shared and to make member countries more business-friendly, among a slew of development-related plans. It also contained measures addressing climate change.  As a developing country with a fast-growing export sector, this year’s host country, Vietnam, has a strong interest in open trade and access for its exports to consumers in the West given the role foreign investment and trade have played in helping its economy to grow at a more than 6 percent pace. Danang, Vietnam’s third-largest city, is in the midst of a construction boom as dozens of resorts and smaller hotels pop up along its scenic coastline.  APEC’s members are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, the U.S. and Vietnam.  The countries participating in the newly renamed Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.",3.5,1,[3.5]

And then there’s the ambitious timetable they’ve set of finishing in time to get legislation to President Donald Trump by Christmas.  The most politically challenging decisions involve dealing with popular and widely used tax deductions, structuring tax cuts for business and balancing personal income tax rates between middle-class families and the rich.

Both House and Senate have adopted accounting gimmicks to squeeze tax cuts that appear larger down to fit that restraint.  Trump’s enormously expensive demand for a cut in the corporate tax rate to 20 percent — from the current 35 percent — is a big complication, as is unrest among House Republicans hailing from affluent suburban districts who are upset over the proposed loss of the deduction for state income taxes.  Here’s a rundown on the major differences between the House and Senate bills:  INDIVIDUAL TAX RATES  The Senate measure keeps the current number of personal income tax brackets, seven, though it changes the rates to 10, 12, 22.5, 25, 32.5, 35 and 38.5 percent. That last top bracket for the wealthiest earners carries a higher rate of 39.6 percent under current law.  The House bill goes further toward simplifying the tax system. It shrinks the number of brackets from seven to four, with rates of 12, 25, 35 and 39.6 percent.  Lots of numbers here for congressional negotiators to play with, to move up or down.  The inheritance tax on multimillion dollar estates, called the estate tax, is an especially hot-button issue. Democrats point to the proposed GOP changes as proof that the Republicans are out to help wealthy people like Trump and his family.  Currently, when someone dies, the person inheriting the estate must pay taxes on its value above $5.5 million for individuals, $11 million for couples. The House bill initially doubles those limits and then repeals the whole tax after 2023. The Senate version doubles those exemption amounts — but doesn’t repeal the tax.  To repeal or not to repeal? That may be the class-warfare question.  DEDUCTIONS  The Senate bill would eliminate a taxpayer’s ability to deduct state income taxes and local property taxes. But the final bill may have to closely track a House compromise that provides a property tax deduction of up to $10,000 or else risk a revolt from GOP lawmakers from New York, New Jersey, and California.  The Senate bill preserves popular individual tax breaks for large medical expenses, mortgage interest, electric vehicles and college costs that were targeted by the House. The House limits deductibility of mortgage interest to the first $500,000 of a loan, riling the real estate and housing industries, and eliminates a deduction for medical expenses that’s often taken by families facing crippling nursing home costs.  BUSINESS:  Both the House and Senate versions slash the tax rate for corporations to 20 percent from the current 35 percent. But there’s a big twist: The Senate bill delays the rate cut for a year.  The delay was put in to reduce the bill’s cost by $100 billion or so — but it’s opposed by the White House and House Republicans. Wall Street hates it too. U.S. stock markets sold off Thursday in response to news of the proposed deferral, with industrial and technology stocks leading the decline, before recouping some of the losses by the close of trading.  Might the implementation delay be traded for a smaller corporate tax cut, something above 20 percent?  Trump actually had been demanding 15 percent and reportedly was initially furious at the 20 percent figure. The issue is setting the corporate rate at a level that experts and tax writers believe would bring the U.S. closer to its overseas competitors.  The electric car industry — notably makers Tesla and Chevrolet — and producers of wind power for generating electricity are losers under the House bill. The tax credit of up to $7,500 for plug-in electric vehicles would be repealed, and the credit for wind energy would be reduced. But the Senate version retains the incentives.  The loss of tax credits for renewable energy would free billions to help pay for the corporate tax cuts in the legislation. But in addition to environmentalists’ objections, the prospect also angers some Republican senators, including powerful Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who has vowed to defend the credit.  There’s a special rate for businesses whose profits are counted in the owners’ personal tax returns. Millions of U.S. businesses use this “pass-through” format. The House bill taxes many of them at a maximum 25 percent, down from 39.6 percent currently, and adds a lower minimum rate. The Senate version would set a new 17.4 percent deduction for “pass-through” income, aimed to help smaller businesses.",4.0,1,[4.0]
1599,3309,11,10,2017,2017-11-10,Associated Press News,Climate activists stage protest at German coal-fired plant,"Greenpeace activists project the writing ""Coal destroys our future"" on the cooling tower of the lignite power plant Neurath near Grevenbroich, western Germany, Friday morning, Nov. 10, 2017 during the global climate meeting in nearby Bonn. (Oliver Berg/dpa via AP)  BONN, Germany (AP) — Environmental activists protested at a German coal-fired power plant on Friday — the same day that Italy became the latest country to announce a deadline for ending its use of the heavily polluting fossil fuel.  Protesters projected images of Pacific islanders threatened by climate change onto the cooling tower of the lignite-fuelled power station in Neurath, in western Germany, along with the words “coal destroys our future.”  The visual display, organized by representatives of Pacific island nations and the environmental group Greenpeace, took place as diplomats from around the world are meeting in nearby Bonn to discuss implementing the 2015 Paris climate accord.  The German government claims to be a leader in the fight against climate change but has refused to set a date for phasing out the use of coal, which emits large amounts of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide when burned. Coal accounts for about 40 percent of Germany’s energy mix.  Several other countries, however, have set a cutoff date for coal, including Italy, which announced it will stop using coal for its national electricity needs by 2025.  Italy’s plan calls for investments of 175 billion euros ($203.5 billion) through 2030 in infrastructure, renewable energy and energy efficiency development. According to government statistics, coal provided 16 percent of Italy’s national electricity in 2015.  Italy’s new energy strategy calls for carbon emissions from energy use to decrease 39 percent by 2030 and 63 percent by 2050.  Coal has become a key issue at the Bonn climate talks. Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore told delegates there Friday that making the switch away from fossil fuels won’t be easy given the industry’s political clout, but that it makes both environmental and financial sense.  “It is insane to force taxpayers to subsidize the destruction of our civilization, and of course, the coal and gas and oil lobbies have a lot of political power,” Gore said. “They built it up over a hundred years, and they have the influence with politicians, not only in my country, but also in China, also in Japan.”  U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters Friday in New York that he will urge participants at Bonn conference to respond to the latest alarming data by further cutting emissions, helping countries respond to climate shocks and mobilizing the $100 billion promised to help developing countries.  He said recent reports send two messages: “accelerate climate action — and raise ambition.”  The 2015 Paris climate accord set a target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) — or 2 degrees at the most — by the end of the century.  Guterres pointed to new worrying data: The World Meteorological Organization reported that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reached new highs in 2016. A U.N. Environment Program report showed that greenhouse gas levels are likely to be so elevated in 2020 that reaching Paris targets for 2030 will be very hard to meet.  Guterres warned that the window of opportunity to keep temperatures to the 2-degree target “may close in 20 years or less — and we may have only five years to bend the emissions curve toward 1.5 degrees.”  “We need at least a further 25 percent cut in emissions by 2020,” he said.  Guterres also called for greater action by governments, businesses and citizens to combat climate change, and he announced he will hold a climate summit “to mobilize political and economic energy at the highest levels” in September 2019.  ___  Jordans reported from Berlin.

1600,3310,11,10,2017,2017-11-10,Associated Press News,Animal rights groups demand action against Iowa fur farm," Federal inspectors have repeatedly ordered a southeast Iowa fur farm to improve the grim living conditions for ferrets, foxes, raccoons and skunks it sells to government laboratories and pet stores.  Many of the animals have been forced to live in sweltering heat or maggot-infested filth, sometimes with decomposing carcasses in their cages, officials found over the last two years.  So far no charges or enforcement action has been taken against the Ruby Fur Farm near New Sharon, 65 miles (105 kilometers) southeast of Des Moines. However, animal rights groups are calling for rescue of the animals, revocation of the farm’s federal license and fines for neglect.  U.S. Department of Agriculture inspectors documented the most recent problems when they returned to the farm seven times between December and August after finding suffering animals.  A building housing 290 raccoons reached 100 degrees in July, with many of the animals panting and drooling and 26 in “severe heat distress,” according to a July 21 inspection report.  Reports from 2015 show injured or sick raccoons as well as skunks and ferrets that didn’t receive veterinary treatment. In one cage a skunk was found living with its dead cage-mate.  A December 2016 report noted: “One dead, decomposing, headless juvenile ferret was found incorporated into the fecal material buildup on the wire floor in the corner of the cage,” which also housed a live adult and six juvenile ferrets.  Federal contracts show that even as USDA inspectors were writing up the reports about the farm’s treatment of raccoons, the agency was signing contracts to buy animals from the company for research. It spent nearly $30,000 in June and December of 2015 and in July 2016.  The business since 2007 received more than $67,000 from USDA contracts to provide skunks, raccoons, and foxes. USDA has expansive research enterprises with divisions that focus on food safety, animal health and food production improvements. One of the contracts indicates raccoons were obtained by a USDA lab in Colorado focusing on wildlife diseases, and another noted young foxes would be used as “research models.”  The farm is licensed to Randy Ruby as a registered federal dealer by the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, and it holds state permits as an animal dealer and a pet shop.  Ruby declined to discuss the reports with The Associated Press when reached by telephone. He referred calls to The Cavalry Group, a Missouri-based animal business advocacy organization to which he is a member.  Its president, Mindy Patterson, said some of the USDA inspectors’ claims are exaggerated and when there has been an issue Ruby has addressed them immediately.  “What we witnessed up close and personal this summer was Randy Ruby’s farm being targeted and harassed with hyper-aggressive inspections,” she said. “We have time-tested agriculture practices to ensure the health and safety of both people and animals that are being redefined as inhumane treatment of animals by these groups who have nothing but an emotion-based agenda.”  The farm’s website says it has been in business for more than 65 years and raises “our animals with tender, loving care, and we can ship them anywhere in the world.”  Michael Budkie, executive director of Stop Animal Exploitation Now, an Ohio-based nonprofit that monitors U.S. research and animal holding facilities, has called for the termination of the fur farm’s federal animal dealer’s license and rescue of the animals.  In an Oct. 16 letter to Robert Gibbens, a veterinarian and the USDA’s director of Animal Welfare Operations based in Colorado, Budkie asked the agency to fine Ruby Fur Farm. He said inspection reports clearly demonstrate “a total disregard for the health and well-being of these animals.”  USDA spokesman R. Andre Bell confirmed the agency has discussed the farm with an animal rights group but declined to say whether it was considering enforcement action or terminating the license. He also declined to discuss whether USDA’s purchased of animals from the fur farm had any impact on its enforcement of animal welfare regulations.  The Iowa Department of Agriculture, which has issued state permits for the farm to operate as a pet shop and registered federal dealer, has no enforcement action pending, said spokesman Dustin Vande Hoef. The agency can revoke the permits if it were to find standard of care issues but it has received no complaints, he said.  Any animal neglect charges must come from a law enforcement officer under Iowa law.  Mahaska County Sheriff Russ VanRenterghem said he accompanied a USDA inspection team to the fur farm three or four times in July.  “I don’t see any violations,” he said, describing the farm’s owners as “very reputable, very good people.”  Iowa is ranked the second worst in the nation for animal welfare behind Kentucky, according to the Animal Legal Defense Fund’s annual rankings released in January.  Iowa enforcement is weak because with a few exceptions animal neglect is not considered a felony, and laws defining adequate shelter conditions are unclear, the group said.  “In general if I was picking a state to be an animal in, Iowa would be very far down my list,” said David Rosengard, a staff attorney for the group’s criminal justice program. “I could be neglected. I could be starved. I could be abandoned and the person who did that wouldn’t face the sort of repercussions they would have to deal with in a lot of other states.”  ___  Sign up for the AP’s weekly newsletter showcasing our best reporting from the Midwest and Texas: http://apne.ws/2u1RMfv .",1.5,2,"[2.0, 1.0]"

Rumbling front loaders began scraping up the ash and rubble of nearly 9,000 destroyed homes and other structures in Northern California this week as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers launched a new phase of the largest wildfire clean-up in the state's history. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu)  SONOMA, Calif. (AP) — Rumbling bulldozers and front-loaders have started scraping up the ash, charred wood and crumbled bricks and concrete left from thousands of homes and buildings destroyed by blazes in California wine country, launching a new phase in the largest wildfire cleanup in state history.  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers contractors began the work this week in flattened, blackened blocks of Santa Rosa’s Coffey Park neighborhood. It experienced some of the most-sweeping destruction last month when fierce winds drove flames that killed at least 43 people and destroyed 8,900 houses and other buildings across Northern California.  On Santa Rosa streets where hundreds of houses once stood, “you look across the landscape and see nothing but burned everything,” Army Corps spokesman Rick Brown said as crews and heavy equipment around him began clearing debris from lots.  U.S., state and local agencies are working on the cleanup, which includes testing soil, air and water samples from burned areas for contamination. Authorities say they expect to have the lots cleared for property owners by early 2018, although rebuilding is expected to take years more.  California puts the insured losses at $3.3 billion so far, among the highest of any U.S. wildfires in recent decades.  Work is underway in California wine country to clear debris from areas ravaged by wildfires that tore through the area a month ago. The flames destroyed more than 8,000 homes in the region north of San Francisco. (Nov. 9)  In hard-hit Sonoma and Napa counties, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency finished the first phase of cleanup at most properties: removing potential hazardous substances before the heavy equipment moves in.  Generally, the fires overran housing developments and rural areas rather than industrial sites, so the hazardous waste is mainly what’s in garages and barns — propane tanks from barbecue grills, cans of motor oil, and pesticides, officials say.  That contrasts with Hurricane Harvey, which flooded more than a dozen Superfund sites in Houston and other coastal areas this year, raising fears that contamination may have reached a wide area. The damage is still being assessed.  In California, crews have started scraping up home foundations and the top 3 to 6 inches (75 to 150 millimeters) of ash, debris and soil, said Brown of the Army Corps of Engineers. In some of the more upscale developments on ridgetops, the work is complicated by ruins that have tumbled downhill, he said.  The Army Corps is taking soil samples near burned homes and buildings and will take more from the lots after they have been scraped, Brown said. The state will test the samples for contaminants such as asbestos or other metals and chemicals to ensure the sites are clean enough for rebuilding.  If not, “we’ll scrape a couple more inches of soil, take that back to the lab, and let them decide if that does it,” Brown said.  Some of those who lost homes have been confused over warnings of possible hazardous substances in the ruins of their neighborhoods. Watching the heavy equipment at work this week, survivor Larry Keyser admitted worrying over contamination but wasn’t sure what the cleanup crews would be testing for.  “Like any concerned citizen, you want to be concerned about your environment,” Keyser said.  Officials, meanwhile, have placed about a dozen air monitors around Sonoma County, including four at schools. The wildfires burned for more than a week and shrouded much of the San Francisco Bay Area in smoke, creating some of the worst air-quality readings on record there.  The air in the burned region is again testing at healthy levels, said Melanie Turner, spokeswoman at the California Air Resources Board.  Around the wildfire zones, teams from local water departments, the U.S. Geological Survey and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories also have been working to reduce and monitor any hazardous runoff into hundreds of waterways.  Teams have spent weeks positioning bundles of straw and bags of gravel or sand between blackened neighborhoods and creeks critical to people and native species, such as local coho salmon.  Devastated areas have received only light rain so far, but heavy downpours could sweep massive amounts of debris and contaminants into waterways.  With more showers at midweek, Rich Fadness at the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board readied a dozen staffers to grab samples of runoff flowing into creeks at four key sites.  “Any time there’s a fire, there’s always issues,” Fadness said. “With the amount of work we’re doing, I hope it will be minimized.”  ___  Associated Press photographer Jeff Chiu contributed to this story.",3.5,1,[3.5]
1606,3339,11,11,2017,2017-11-11,Associated Press News,"US cities, states defy Trump, still back Paris climate deal","Demonstrators costumed as U.S. President Donald Trump and polar bears protest against the climate change during climate conference COP in Bonn, western Germany, Saturday, Nov. 11, 2017. (Bernd Thissen/dpa via AP)  BONN, Germany (AP) — A group of U.S. states, cities, businesses and universities said Saturday they are still committed to curbing global warming even as U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration is walking away from the Paris climate accord.  But the alliance, which has an economy larger than Japan and Germany combined, says it won’t be able to achieve the necessary cut in greenhouse gas emissions without some efforts at the federal level.  “It is important for the world to know, the American government may have pulled out of the Paris agreement, but the American people are committed to its goals, and there is nothing Washington can do to stop us,” former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg said at a global climate meeting in Bonn, Germany.  Gov. Jerry Brown of California echoed those comments.  “In the United States, we have a federal system, and states have real power as do cities. And when cities and states combine together, and then join with powerful corporations, that’s how we get stuff done,” he said.  His speech was briefly interrupted by anti-coal and anti-fracking protesters, who held up banners and shouted “We’re still in! Trump’s still out!”  The group calling itself “America’s Pledge” said states, cities and private groups have been taking considerable steps to reduce emissions by promoting renewable energy use and climate-friendly transportation systems.  “This is a pledge, and it’s a pledge that you can cash, because it’s real,” Brown said. “We are doing real stuff in California.”  In a report, however, the group said that “we cannot underscore strongly enough the critical nature of federal engagement to achieve the deep decarbonization goals the U.S. must undertake after 2025.”  Daniel Firger, one of the report’s contributors, said it was intended to show that many in the U.S. aren’t prepared to wait for Trump to change his mind on climate change again or wait for the next administration to tackle the issue.  “The good news around Trump’s announcement to withdraw is that it has galvanized a groundswell of bottom-up support from all corners of the U.S. economy,” Firger told The Associated Press.  Cities, regions and businesses in other nations around the world could look to the group for inspiration and support, he said, noting that the lessons learned by local authorities and businesses in the U.S. could be applied elsewhere.  Also Saturday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in her weekly podcast that every country needs to pitch in to keep global temperatures from rising.  Merkel also said it’s the responsibility of the industrial countries to develop environment-friendly technologies that are future-oriented, but “don’t lead to a loss of jobs.”  “We don’t gain anything if steel mills, aluminum plants and copper mills leave our countries and go somewhere else where environmental regulations are less strict — because then we haven’t made any gains for world climate,” she said.  ___  Jordans reported from Berlin.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)  HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — President Donald Trump is exchanging school yard taunts with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.  In a response to North Korea calling Trump’s speech in South Korea “reckless remarks by an old lunatic,” Trump tweeted from Hanoi on Sunday morning: “Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me ‘old,’ when I would NEVER call him ‘short and fat?’”  Trump goes on to say sarcastically, “Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend — and maybe someday that will happen!”  Trump has been working to rally global pressure against North Korea’s nuclear weapons program on a trip to Asia. That includes a stern speech delivered in South Korea’s National Assembly on Tuesday, in which he said: “Do not underestimate us. And do not try us. ... The weapons you’re acquiring are not making you safer, they are putting your regime in grave danger. Every step you take down this dark path increases the peril you face.”  On Saturday, Kim’s government responded by accusing Trump of trying to demonize North Korea, keep it apart from the international community and undermine its government.  “Reckless remarks by an old lunatic like Trump will never scare us or stop our advance,” the North’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement. “On the contrary, all this makes us more sure that our choice to promote economic construction at the same time as building up our nuclear force is all the more righteous, and it pushes us to speed up the effort to complete our nuclear force.”  North Korea is not known to have tested any of its missiles or nuclear devices since Sept. 15, a relative lull after a brisk series of tests earlier this year.  Asked at news conference with Vietnam’s president later Sunday if he could become friends with the North Korean leader, Trump replied it “might be a strange thing to happen but it’s certainly a possibility.”  He said he doesn’t know if that friendship will develop, but added it would be “very, very nice if it did.”",4.0,1,[4.0]
1608,3342,11,12,2017,2017-11-12,Associated Press News,Allegations against Roy Moore roil US evangelical ranks,"Former Alabama Chief Justice and U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore speaks at the Vestavia Hills Public library, Saturday, Nov. 11, 2017, in Birmingham, Ala. According to a Thursday, Nov. 9 Washington Post story an Alabama woman said Moore made inappropriate advances and had sexual contact with her when she was 14. Moore has denied the allegations. (AP Photo/Brynn Anderson)  For many evangelicals, fiery Alabama politician and judge Roy Moore has been a longtime hero. Others have sometimes cringed at his heated rhetoric and bellicose style.  Now, as Moore’s U.S. Senate campaign is imperiled by allegations of sexual overtures to a 14-year-old girl when he was in his 30s, there’s an outpouring of impassioned and soul-searching discussion in evangelical ranks.  “This is one of those excruciating decision moments for evangelicals,” Albert Mohler, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, said in a telephone interview. “These allegations, if true, are devastating. If true, this is a very big deal.”  Mohler said Alabama voters face a potentially wrenching task of trying to determine if the allegations — Moore has emphatically denied them — are credible.  According the Pew Research Center, 49 percent of Alabama adults are evangelical Protestants. For some of them, the Moore allegations echo the quandary they faced last year, wrestling over whether to support Donald Trump in the presidential race despite his crude sexual boasts.  The Rev. Robert Franklin, professor of moral leadership at Emory University’s Candler School of Theology in Atlanta, said The Washington Post’s report about the Moore allegations represents a test of “moral consistency” for evangelicals.  “Evangelicals are steadily losing their moral authority in the larger public square by intensifying their uncritical loyalty to Donald Trump,” Franklin wrote in an email. “Since this is Roy Moore and not Donald Trump, I think there may be significant disaffection with him, and increased demands for his removal from the ballot.”  As for Moore himself, Franklin suggested there were “classic evangelical remedies” such as confession, prayer and remorse and isolation.  “Election to higher office is not one of them,” Franklin wrote.  Although Trump won 80 percent of the white evangelical vote in his presidential victory, his candidacy exposed and hardened rifts among conservative Christians about partisan politics, the personal character of government leaders and the Gospel. Surveys by the Public Religion Research Institute found that the percentage of white evangelicals who said they still trusted the leadership of a politician who commits an immoral act rose from 30 percent in 2011 to 72 percent last year.  Still, a solid minority of conservative Christians adopted the #NeverTrump hashtag on social media and joined those outside of evangelicalism who said “values voters” had lost their values. Women and black evangelicals especially emerged as critics of Trump’s remarks about women, immigrants, African-Americans and Muslims. Many of these same critics of Trump’s behavior and rhetoric condemned Moore in recent days, and bemoaned the fact that some evangelicals were standing by him.  “Okay, seriously, we elected a man president who bragged about using his power and authority to sexually assault women,” tweeted Kyle James Howard, an African-American student at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. “Why are we surprised that members of his party would now be defending a party member’s sexual assault of a minor?”  One of the Southern Baptist Convention’s leading public policy experts, the Rev. Russell Moore, expressed dismay after the allegations against Judge Moore — no relation — surfaced on Thursday.  “Whether in the hills of Hollywood or the halls of power, it doesn’t matter,” Rev. Moore tweeted. “This is true: sexual assault and child molestation are evil, unjust, satanic.”  Roy Moore embraced controversy as he built his evangelical following. He was twice removed from his post as Alabama’s chief justice, once for disobeying a federal court order to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the lobby of the state judicial building, and later for urging probate judges to defy the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage.  Among those declining to break with Moore in the wake of the sex allegations was Jerry Falwell Jr., president of evangelical Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia.  “It comes down to a question of who is more credible in the eyes of the voters — the candidate or the accuser,” Falwell told Religion News Service. “And I believe the judge is telling the truth.”  Mohler, the seminary president, said many evangelical Alabama voters will find themselves facing a difficult choice when ballots are cast in the Dec. 12 special election.  “There’s so much at stake,” he said. “Those of us who are pro-life have got to be very concerned about losing even one seat in the U.S. Senate.”  The Democratic candidate in the special election, Doug Jones, has said that a decision on whether to have an abortion should generally be left to the woman in question.  Abortion policy also was evoked by Ed Cyzewski, a Kentucky-based seminary graduate and author, in a series of Twitter posts Friday questioning why some of his fellow evangelicals would continue to stand by Moore.  “Right now there are evangelicals who feel trapped,” Cyzewski wrote. “They think Moore did something reprehensible, but believe abortion is evil.”  Katelyn Beaty, an editor at large with the evangelical magazine Christianity Today, suggested that among many of Moore’s evangelical supporters, there’s a “presumption of innocence” because of their mistrust of national media such as The Washington Post.  “Many Christian communities have trouble appropriately responding to sex abuse allegations,” Beaty wrote in an email. “There is a default trust in powerful, charismatic male leaders, coupled with a discomfort with women who use their story or voice to challenge the status quo or power structures.”  However, Beaty said more moderate evangelicals — notably those critical of Trump — were likely dismayed by the allegations against Moore.  “For them, the defense of Moore is another sign that both evangelicalism and the GOP have lost their credibility and their souls in the pursuit of power,” she wrote.  ___  AP Religion Writer Rachel Zoll in New York contributed to this report.",3.0,1,[3.0]
1623,3378,11,13,2017,2017-11-13,Associated Press News,Trump does not publicly rebuke Duterte for drug war killings,"President Donald Trump speaks with Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte at an ASEAN Summit dinner at the SMX Convention Center, Sunday, Nov. 12, 2017, in Manila, Philippines. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)  MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has sanctioned a bloody drug war that features extrajudicial killing. He called Barack Obama a “son of a whore.” This week, he boasted that he murdered a man with his own hands.  All that went unmentioned in public by President Donald Trump when the leaders held talks Monday in the Philippines.  Reporters saw the beginning of the leaders’ bilateral meeting during which Trump praised Duterte’s hospitality, the organization of the summit he was hosting and even Manila’s weather. Trump said nothing about human rights and both leaders ignored shouted questions about the violent drug crackdown. The two men also shared a laugh in the meeting when Duterte called reporters “spies.”  Later, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that the 40-minute meeting focused on ISIS, illegal drugs, and trade. Human rights, she added, briefly came up in the context of the Philippines’ fight against illegal drugs. She did not say if Trump was critical of the violence.  That appeared to conflict with the Philippines’ version of the meeting. Harry Roque, a spokesman for Duterte, said “there was no mention of human rights. There was no mention of extralegal killings. There was only a rather lengthy discussion of the Philippine war on drugs with President Duterte doing most of the explaining.”  Breaking with his presidential predecessors, Trump has largely abandoned publicly pressing foreign leaders on human rights, instead showing a willingness to embrace international strongmen for strategic gain. He has cozied up to autocrats such as Saudi Arabia’s King Salman, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi and Russian President Vladimir Putin. And earlier in this trip to Asia he made no mention of human rights during multiple appearances in Beijing with Chinese President Xi Jinping.  “Trump seems very comfortable with strongmen. It’s not just that he won’t criticize Duterte. I wouldn’t be surprised if he patted him on the back,” said Mike Chinoy, senior fellow at U.S.-China Institute at the University of Southern California, before the meeting.  Duterte’s war on drugs has alarmed human rights advocates around the world who say it has allowed police officers and vigilantes to ignore due process and to take justice into their own hands. Government officials estimate that well over 3,000 people, mostly drug users and dealers, have died in the ongoing crackdown. Human rights groups believe the victim total is far higher, perhaps closer to 9,000.  “Human rights groups, I think, will be quite disappointed by the visit,” said Amy Searight, director of the Southeast Asia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “It’s unlikely that human rights or rule of law or due process are going to be topics that President Trump will raise.”  Duterte has strenuously defended the violence and boasted of participating himself.  Late last year, he bragged that he personally pulled the trigger and killed three people years ago while serving as mayor of Davao City. And last week, while in Vietnam for an international summit, he said he took his first life years earlier.  “When I was a teenager, I had been in and out of jail, rumble here and there,” Duterte said during a speech in Danang, where he briefly crossed paths with Trump on the sidelines of an international summit. “At the age of 16, I already killed someone.”  He claimed he fatally stabbed the person “just over a look.” His spokesman later tried to downplay the comment, saying, “I think it was in jest.”  Trump has shown little interest in pressuring Duterte to rein in the violence, instead saluting him during a May phone call.  “I just wanted to congratulate you because I am hearing of the unbelievable job on the drug problem,” Trump told Duterte, according to a transcript of the conversation that later leaked. “Many countries have the problem, we have a problem, but what a great job you are doing and I just wanted to call and tell you that.”  Trump also criticized Obama during the call, noting that his predecessor “did not understand” the drug problem the Philippines faces. Meanwhile, Duterte was openly critical of Obama in the final year of his presidency, including cursing his name.  White House officials have suggested there is a strategy behind Trump’s flattery of Duterte.  Advisers have said that while Trump was always unlikely to publicly chastise the Philippine president, he may offer criticisms behind closed doors. Trump would plan to hold his tongue in public in order not to embarrass Duterte, whom he is urging to help pressure North Korea and fight terrorism, and to avoid pushing him into the arms of China.  “If the administration is not going to care about human rights in China, why would you care in the Philippines?” asked Gordon Chang, Asia expert and author of “Nuclear Showdown: North Korea Takes On the World.” He said the “logical thing to do is keep them close and not let Duterte flirt with China. In our struggle with China, we need all the friends when we can get.”  Duterte has seemed less committed to the strategic partnership with the U.S. Searight said a good relationship is “vital to the United States given its location on the South China Sea and the enhanced access that the American military has gotten in recent years with the Philippines.”  White House aides have suggested that Trump’s strategy has worked before, pointing to his interactions with el-Sissi. Trump refrained from chastising the Egyptian leader but quietly worked with him to help engineer the release of American prisoner Aya Hijazi in April.  Trump dismissed the notion that he buddied up to dictators. He said Saturday he has great relationships with all sorts of leaders, “every person in that room today,” after leaving a summit in Vietnam attended by Duterte and Putin, among others.  Human rights groups have expressed dismay at Trump’s public silence, believing that the spotlight an American president can shine on human rights abuses overseas can rally pressure on an authoritarian regime to change its ways.  “In the old days, we used to call on the U.S. government to raise human rights issues during these trips,” said John Sifton, Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch. But given the administration’s lack of credibility in raising human rights abuses, he said, they have pivoted to a different tack, focusing on international attention.  “We haven’t given up,” Sifton said.  ___  Associated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report.  ___  Follow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire",4.625,4,"[5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.5]"

The EU on Monday Nov. 13, 2017 banned arms sales to Venezuela and set up a system to slap asset freezes and travel restrictions on Venezuelan officials as it seeks to ramp up pressure on President Nicolas Maduro. The move was decided by EU foreign ministers at talks in Brussels. (AP Photo/Ariana Cubillos, File)  CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Foreign investors walked a red carpet at a state palace Monday eager to hear strategies for reorganizing Venezuela’s billions in debt, but they left minutes later having learned no concrete plans to address the country’s financial crisis.  Vice President Tareck El Aissami, who headed the talks, used much of his time to rail against U.S. President Donald Trump and foreign lenders for leading what the government calls an “economic war” against this oil-rich nation.  But he also tried to assure creditors that debts will continue to be paid, echoing statements by President Nicolas Maduro that Venezuela has made more than $70 billion in debt payments since 2013.  “The state has fully honored its national and international commitments, especially with regard to external debt service,” El Aissami said in a televised broadcast. “Even with great sacrifice, we have paid every penny of our debt service.”  Those few investors who bothered to show up had few expectations for the meeting, which from the start was clouded in confusion.  Maduro invited investors to Caracas a little more than a week ago while announcing his goal of renegotiating a foreign debt that he said has become impossible to repay because of a U.S.-led financial “blockade” of the socialist-run country.  As Venezuela spent heavily on social programs under the late President Hugo Chavez, a time when global oil prices soared, its debt skyrocketed to over $120 billion, about half of which is in the form of dollar-denominated bonds. The drop in crude prices has ravaged the country that sits atop the world’s largest oil reserves, leading to widespread shortages amid triple-digit inflation.  Strained relations between Venezuela and the United States are compounding the situation.  The Trump administration has sanctioned a growing list of Venezuelan officials, including the government’s top two debt negotiators, Economy Minister Simon Zerpa and El Aissami. The vice president is accused of being a major drug trafficker.  Washington has also barred U.S. companies from lending new money to Venezuela because of human rights abuses committed during months of anti-government protests and Maduro’s efforts to squash the opposition.  But in a sign the Trump administration might be willing to soften its stance, the Treasury Department said last week that it would consider allowing Americans to deal in new debt if any restructuring plan was backed by Venezuela’s opposition-controlled congress, whose authority has been steadfastly ignored by Maduro’s government.  Russ Dallen, managing partner of Caracas Capital Markets, said several U.S. investors he represents told him they wouldn’t bother attending. One said he couldn’t get a visa on such short notice and another reported planning to send an intern, citing the lack of information.  “You’d think they’d put it on the table and let you study it if there was some kind of proposal,” Dallen said. “There’s nothing. Just crickets.”  Also Monday, at an informal meeting to discuss Venezuela at the U.N. Security Council, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley called Venezuela “an increasingly violent narco-state” that threatens the world.  Venezuela’s U.N. ambassador, Rafael Ramirez, responded by denouncing the session.  “This is a hostile act from the United States and an interference that violates the sovereignty principles of a country that is a member of the United Nations,” he told reporters.  In Brussels earlier in the day, the European Union banned arms sales to Venezuela and set up a system to slap asset freezes and travel restrictions on Venezuelan officials as it seeks to ramp up pressure on Maduro. The weapons ban would stop sales of military equipment that could be used for repression or surveillance of Venezuelans.",3.5,1,[3.5]
1625,3382,11,12,2017,2017-11-12,Associated Press News,Rural areas at risk as water levels drop in massive aquifer," The draining of a massive aquifer that underlies portions of eight states in the central U.S. is drying up streams, causing fish to disappear and threatening the livelihood of farmers who rely on it for their crops.  Water levels in the Ogallala aquifer have been dropping for decades as irrigators pump water faster than rainfall can recharge it.  An analysis of federal data found the Ogallala aquifer shrank twice as fast over the past six years compared with the previous 60, The Denver Post reports.  The drawdown has become so severe that streams are drying at a rate of 6 miles per year and some highly resilient fish are disappearing. In rural areas, farmers and ranchers worry they will no longer have enough water for their livestock and crops as the aquifer is depleted.  The aquifer lost 10.7 million acre-feet of storage between 2013 and 2015, the U.S. Geological Survey said in a June report.  “Now I never know, from one minute to the next, when I turn on a faucet or hydrant, whether there will be water or not,” said Lois Scott, 75, who lives west of Cope, Colorado, north of the frequently bone-dry bed of the Arikaree River.  A 40-foot well her grandfather dug by hand in 1914 gave water until recently, she said, lamenting the loss of lawns where children once frolicked and green pastures for cows. Scott’s now considering a move to Brush, Colorado, and leaving her family’s historic homestead farm.  “This will truly become the Great American Desert,” she said.  Also known as the High Plains Aquifer, the Ogallala underlies 175,000 square miles (453,000 square kilometers), including parts of Colorado, Wyoming Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Texas. That’s one of the primary agricultural regions of the U.S., producing $35 billion in crops annually.  Farmers and ranchers have been tapping into the aquifer since the 1930s to boost production and help them get by in times of drought.  However, overpumping has dried up 358 miles of surface rivers and streams across a 200-square-mile area covering eastern Colorado, western Kansas and Nebraska, according to researchers from Colorado State University and Kansas State University.  If farmers keep pumping water at the current pace, another 177 miles of rivers and streams will be lost before 2060, the researchers determined.  “We have almost completely changed the species of fish that can survive in those streams, compared with what was there historically. This is really a catastrophic change,” said Kansas State University conservation biologist Keith Gido, one of the authors of a report on the aquifer published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  If all pumping stopped immediately, it would still take hundreds of years for rain-fed streams and rivers to recharge the aquifer, Gido said.  ___  Information from: The Denver Post, http://www.denverpost.com",4.5,1,[4.5]

The rocket is carrying cargo to the International Space Station. (AP Photo/Steve Helber)  CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — A stash of frozen treats and other supplies rocketed toward the International Space Station on Sunday, this time from Virginia’s cold eastern shore.  NASA’s commercial shipper, Orbital ATK, launched the cargo ship just after sunrise from Wallops Island, aboard an unmanned Antares rocket.  The Cygnus capsule should reach the orbiting lab Tuesday. It’s loaded with 7,400 pounds of cargo, including sweet treats for the six station astronauts. There are frozen fruit bars, ice cream bars, ice cream sandwiches and cups of chocolate and vanilla ice cream — about 80 in all, according to NASA.  The crew expects pizza as well. Italian astronaut Paolo Nespoli has been craving pizza for months.  “Pizza and ice cream on the way!” NASA astronaut Joe Acaba tweeted following liftoff. “Eagerly awaiting the arrival.”  This marked Orbital ATK’s first launch from its home turf in more than a year. The last time it made a space station delivery, it used another company’s rocket flying from Cape Canaveral, Florida.  Crowds gathered at Wallops in freezing temperatures and cheered as the rocket soared toward the southeast. Sunrise made it hard to see the launch farther afield. The field of visibility stretched from New England to the Carolinas.  A launch attempt on Saturday was nixed after a plane strayed into the restricted airspace. Sunday’s try was almost foiled by a couple of boats that briefly wandered into the keep-out zone.  Orbital ATK named the capsule after the last man to walk on the moon, Apollo 17′s Gene Cernan, who died in January. During the final minutes of the countdown, a launch controller paid tribute to Cernan as well as J.R. Thompson, a high-ranking NASA and Orbital ATK official who died last week.  The capsule will remain at the space station until the beginning of December, when it’s cut loose for a test of close proximity flying, a series of mini satellite deployments and, lastly, a fiery re-entry with a load of trash.  SpaceX is NASA’s other prime supplier. It’s next station delivery is next month.",4.75,2,"[4.5, 5.0]"
