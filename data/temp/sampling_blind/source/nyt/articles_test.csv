3,80,8,29,2017,2017-08-29,The New York Times,"Trump Tax Plan May Free Up Corporate Dollars, but Then What?","If taxing foreign earnings that have already accumulated overseas is difficult, so is eliminating incentives that reward companies for continuing to keep profits in tax havens. To that end, Mr. Trump and the Republican leadership have pushed to slash the corporate tax rate and switch to what is known as a territorial system that would tax only profits earned in the United States and not those earned in other countries.  Mihir Desai, an economist at Harvard Business School, likes that approach. “We currently have the worst of all worlds,” he wrote in an email. “We have a high marginal rate,” which encourages companies to avoid taxes and puts the United States at a global disadvantage.  “And we have low average rates” — because of all the loopholes — “which indicate that we’re not collecting as much as we used to, given the very high level of corporate profits.”  The crucial questions are how to pay for a lower rate and how to prevent abuses. Corporate tax cuts that lead to huge deficits could hobble the economy. And a territorial system without sufficient safeguards could end up encouraging even more businesses to shift profits, operations and jobs to countries with lower tax rates.  Other nations with territorial systems have tried to prevent companies from wriggling out of paying taxes, while tax experts have suggested proposals ranging from a minimum global tax to tighter rules to prevent companies from relocating their patents and copyrights to tax havens like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands.  But skeptics worry that making the system airtight is impossible. “It’s an endless cat-and-mouse game,” said Matthew Gardner, senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a research group based in Washington. “What’s driving companies to engage in paper transactions is not our 35 percent tax rate,” he said, but other countries’ willingness to undercut whatever rate the United States settles on. “You can never win if you are competing against their zero tax rate.”  Mr. Gardner argued that a broader definition of American competitiveness is needed that includes not only the tax system, but also the business infrastructure that the tax system supports — bridges and roads, health care, education and research and development. “If all you think about is the tax rate, then it should be zero,” he said. “Competitiveness is about finding the right balance.”",3.75,2,"[4.0, 3.5]"
5,85,8,29,2017,2017-08-29,The New York Times,Britain Looks to Address Inequality With Executive Pay Measures," Worried by a long-term rise in inequality, Britain announced on Tuesday a series of measures aimed at increasing transparency over executive compensation, hoping to ramp up pressure on companies that offer lavish salaries for bosses but restrict pay for regular employees.  The proposals include plans to force all publicly listed companies to publish their wage ratio, comparing their chief executive’s salary with that of the average worker, as well as the creation of a register that “names and shames” firms that faced shareholder opposition over executive pay levels.  In much of the Western world, public anger is growing over what critics say are excessive wages for senior business leaders. That has helped contribute to a populist backlash in many countries, as the gap between the salaries of employees and their managers has widened markedly.  In the United States, pay packages for top bosses grew last year, with the highest paid, Thomas M. Rutledge, the chief executive of Charter Communications, making $98 million. That was 2,617 times the average salary for American workers.",3.5,1,[3.5]
14,120,8,29,2017,2017-08-29,The New York Times,Home Health Care: Shouldn’t It Be Work Worth Doing?,"Do you know who is going to care for you when you are old and frail? By current standards, it’s likely to be a middle-aged immigrant woman, with maybe a high school education and little if any training, making $20,000 a year.    And that’s if you are lucky. If you live in rural America, you may already have a hard time finding somebody to look after you. Paul Osterman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management calculates that if nothing is done to draw more workers into the field, there will be a shortage of at least 350,000 paid care providers by 2040.  This, I’m sure you’ll agree, makes little sense.  How to provide long-term care for a fast-aging population poses one of the more convoluted challenges of the American labor market. Care providers — home health aides, personal care attendants and certified nursing assistants, in the government’s classification — are expected to be among the nation’s fastest-growing occupations. The Department of Labor’s economists expect about a million more will be added from 2014 to 2024.  And yet despite their critical importance to the well-being of tens of millions of aging Americans, one-fourth of these aides live in poverty. The jobs are so unappealing that it is hard to keep workers in them: four in 10 leave the occupation entirely within a year. Many prefer the fast-food business.",3.5,1,[3.5]
16,124,8,28,2017,2017-08-28,The New York Times,Markets Are Signaling That Hurricane Harvey Won’t Crush the Economy,"In the early days after that disaster, there were fears about disruptions to incoming supplies of coffee and bananas and to Midwest grain normally exported via barges down the Mississippi River. If you look at the overall data from that year for those and other affected commodities, though, there’s not much evidence of any lasting problems, reflecting the ability of corporate supply chain and logistics managers to find other ways to get products to market.  Financial losses. In theory, a natural disaster could deliver such severe losses to insurers, banks or other financial institutions as to cause broader economic problems.  There’s not much evidence of that happening because of Harvey for a few reasons. Home insurance policies generally do not cover flooding, which means the severe flood damage should have less impact on insurers’ payouts than you might expect. For many individuals, the financial losses from flooding can be devastating. But the possibility of the kinds of systemic problems that ripple across global financial markets appears remote.  Insurers’ balance sheets are relatively strong after years without mega-catastrophes demanding particularly enormous payouts.  Rebuilding costs. One of the paradoxes of disaster economics is that they can actually be good for economic growth, at least the way “growth” is commonly measured.  The need to rebuild or repair flooded buildings in Texas could create a surge in economic output in the state in the months ahead, generating higher growth in gross domestic product. This is a macabre artifact of economic accounting — no one would suggest that people are actually better off when billions of dollars’ worth of capital is destroyed. But it is how the math works.  If this disaster had happened in a period like 2009 or 2010, when the housing bust had left millions of people — especially construction workers — unemployed, the need to rebuild homes and businesses in Houston might have worked like stimulus spending.",4.5,1,[4.5]
25,189,8,31,2017,2017-08-31,The New York Times,Storm’s Impact on Oil Industry Is Felt at Gasoline Pumps,"Five of Houston’s nine refineries are shut down, though no serious permanent damage has been reported. Floodwaters continue to rise in areas, potentially jeopardizing the city’s other refineries, already operating below normal levels.  Serious flooding may also be a problem in Beaumont and Port Arthur, where Exxon Mobil, Saudi Aramco-Motiva, Total and Valero have large refineries.  The operator of the Colonial Pipeline has said operations from Texas will resume as soon as refining safely does, but probably no earlier than Sunday. The pipeline, which normally carries more than 15 percent of the fuel consumed nationwide, continues to operate east of Lake Charles, taking petroleum products north.  Even when the refineries start again, problems will remain at the port of Houston. The Coast Guard, already overburdened, needs to remove debris to protect docking vessels, and flooded railways and roads may keep dockworkers from unloading vessels and putting cargo on trains and ships.  The storm’s impact has been felt in oil and gas production as well as refining. Output from offshore platforms is down nearly 20 percent. Oil companies are beginning to return to the platforms to inspect possible damage from the storm, a process that could take weeks, before near full production can resume.  Meanwhile, flooding in the Eagle Ford shale field in southern Texas has cut production by an estimated 300,000 barrels a day. That is only about 3 percent of national production, but more important may be permanent damage to the shale wells. That is an engineering and geological uncertainty since the long horizontal wells, blasted through hard rock, are relatively new and have never been seriously tested by flooding.  The most important shale field in the country, the Permian Basin in West Texas, was not directly hit by the storm. But with refineries closed along the coast, pipelines out of the Permian have been shut off, and production is already declining. Fuel supplies necessary to keep the drilling rigs going may also fall short because of the refinery shutdowns.",4.5,1,[4.5]
27,192,8,31,2017,2017-08-31,The New York Times,"For Tax Reform Lessons, Congress Needn’t Look Far","“We now have the lowest general sales tax and lowest property taxes in the region, and the business tax is the same as Maryland,” he said. While he conceded that there is no way of knowing to what extent the tax cuts stimulated growth, he added: “We’re no longer seen as the high-tax jurisdiction. People feel good about that, which is a psychological factor that I feel is very important.”  Contrast that success with what happened in Kansas, which also carried out a notable tax experiment recently. Under the leadership of Gov. Sam Brownback, the Republican-dominated Legislature passed deep tax cuts that went into effect in 2013, with only modest efforts to raise revenue by broadening the base. The governor called the move “a shot of adrenaline into the heart of the Kansas economy.”  If so, it was a shot that nearly killed the patient. There was no surge in economic growth — Kansas lost jobs in 2015, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported, trailing its neighbors Nebraska and Oklahoma and posting one of the worst performances of any state. In June, faced with a $900 million budget gap, Kansas lawmakers threw in the towel. They passed a $1.2 billion tax increase and overrode Mr. Brownback’s veto.  Tax reform is never easy, and it wasn’t in the District of Columbia, either. There are no Republicans on the council, but as the Republicans have discovered, there can be sharp divisions within the same party. Among elected officials, the main opposition came from Vincent C. Gray, then the mayor, and the most liberal council members, who favored spending increases over tax cuts.  “The counterweight is always to spend the money,” Mr. Mendelson told me this week. “The mayor wanted to spend it, so I had to step up. Other members were willing to stand behind me as long as I was willing to take the political heat.”  The council passed the measure by a vote of 11 to 2. Opponents have fought a rear-guard action to delay putting the measure’s remaining cuts into effect, without success.",2.5,1,[2.5]
29,194,8,31,2017,2017-08-31,The New York Times,One Effort to Close the Gender Pay Gap Won’t Get a Try Under Trump,"The Obama administration had an idea it thought would help address the pay gap between white men and almost everyone else: requiring companies to report how much they paid people, along with their sex and race.  On Tuesday, that regulation became the latest of those reversed by the Trump administration, before the requirement was to go into effect next year.  Pay transparency, alone, would not have solved the pay gap problem. But without it, employees and regulators won’t have evidence that a problem exists at any particular company — and employers will face less pressure to fix it.  There is little data on whether forcing companies to disclose pay makes it more equitable, mostly because the pay of individual workers or companies is generally kept secret. The Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys companies about compensation, but publishes only aggregate, anonymous data. Researchers who have studied the few instances in which companies have publicly disclosed individual salaries say it is not enough to close pay gaps, nor is it essential — some companies have closed them on their own, without publicly reporting pay information.",3.5,1,[3.5]
37,227,9,4,2017,2017-09-04,The New York Times,The Cost of Hurricane Harvey: Only One Recent Storm Comes Close,"It’s far too early for a definitive estimate of the economic damage caused by Hurricane Harvey. Floodwaters still swamp large swaths of the Houston area and beyond, into far eastern Texas and Louisiana.  But three independent estimates from people who specialize in disaster and risk management show that the storm is likely to be the most expensive or second-most expensive natural disaster in the United States since 1980, the earliest year such comparable data was kept by the National Centers for Environmental Information. On Friday, estimates for Harvey from these groups ranged from $70 billion to $108 billion.  The estimates are unofficial and changing daily as the storm continues and as the scope of the damage is better understood. But even these initial estimates stand out on a chart comparing the costs of every natural disaster costing $1 billion or more since 1980 (adjusted for inflation).  Billion-dollar natural disasters since 1980 Circles are sized proportionally to their cost in 2017 dollars Winter storms, freezing Drought and wildfire Flooding Tropical cyclones Severe storms  Harvey’s toll may yet increase and put the storm on a scale of economic devastation with Hurricane Katrina, which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) estimates cost about $160 billion in today’s dollars and resulted in 1,833 deaths.  There are several other estimates of the cost of Harvey not included here. A prominent one, by Joel Myers of Accuweather, is $190 billion. It is not included in the chart above because it may not be directly comparable with the estimates as NOAA calculates them. Mr. Myers’s estimate includes the “total negative impact on the economy,” he said, from supply chain interruptions to spoiled food.  “There are downstream impacts that other people might not have considered,” Mr. Myers said.  His prediction – nearly double the highest estimates included here – may ultimately prove to be correct. The estimates shown here have all been revised upward, though none show it to be more expensive than Katrina.  “Each day that passes, as the impacts multiply, it seems more likely that Harvey may ultimately eclipse the cost of Katrina, and it might not even be close,” said Adam Smith, a climatologist focusing on disaster economics with NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information. Mr. Smith has written about how NOAA estimates the costs of natural disasters.  The numbers for Harvey are educated guesses for now. It will be more than a month until NOAA releases its first official estimate, Mr. Smith said.  The groups making the estimates shown here are:  • RMS, a risk modeling firm based in California. It estimated the cost at $70 billion to $90 billion as of Thursday.  • Moody’s Analytics, a research firm. It estimated between $86 billion and $108 billion on Friday.  • Chuck Watson, a disaster modeler with Enki Research. He estimated $72 billion to $85 billion on Thursday.  Each of the three uses a mixture of models and observed data from the storm. They update their estimates as new information is available.  While no outside group can replicate the exact methodology that NOAA will use to assess the economic impact of the storm, Mr. Smith said the methods of these groups were broadly comparable to NOAA’s.  If anything, these numbers are likely to be conservative. Mr. Watson’s estimates for the cost of the storm have more than tripled, from his estimate of $22 billion on Aug. 25, the day before the storm made landfall. And Mr. Smith said even the first official account from NOAA, expected Oct. 6, is likely to be a lower-bound estimate, updated for months to come.  One reason estimates may continue to fluctuate is that flooding is an uncertain kind of damage to assess economically, in part because damage from floods is less likely to be covered by insurance. As the extent of flooding becomes better known, the uncertainty around these estimates will narrow.  Regardless, it’s clear this type of economic devastation from storms is becoming more common. In inflation-adjusted terms, the United States averaged fewer than three billion-dollar natural disasters per year from 1980 to 1990. Since 2010, it has averaged more than 10 per year.

40,239,9,1,2017,2017-09-01,The New York Times,The August Jobs Numbers Are Weak. Don’t Blame Trump.,"The bad news is that wages and incomes are rising more slowly than what has been normal in recent decades, and millions of prime-age Americans remain on the sidelines of the labor market. (The single worst piece of news in the August numbers is that the proportion of those 25 to 54 working actually fell by 0.3 of a percentage point, to 78.4 percent.)  Once you view the 2016 economic data as indicating stability, the question is how much credit or blame the Trump administration deserves.  There are of course many ways presidents affect the economy, including tax and spending policies they enact, their approach to regulating major industries and appointments to the Federal Reserve.  But on all of these frontiers, there hasn’t been enough change since January to account for any change in hiring behavior by businesses. The tax code remains the same as it was on Jan. 20, and there have been no changes to federal spending in the fiscal year about to end. No Trump appointees have been confirmed to serve on the Fed.  The picture on regulatory policy is more complicated, and certainly agencies have leeway in interpreting and enforcing existing regulations that Trump appointees are using in more pro-business ways. In regulated industries like banking and energy production, companies may make investment decisions based on expectations of what is coming out of Washington. But the actual repeal of regulations or the writing of new ones is a lengthy, arduous process that is only getting underway.  Presidents in general have less control over the economy than headlines tend to suggest. But a year from now — when there may be Trump-signed tax legislation, a Trump-appointed Federal Reserve chair, and a bunch of regulations devised by Trump appointees — it will make more sense to ask what the current administration means for the economy.",3.5,1,[3.5]

We don’t merely need training programs for niche populations or circumstances, expensive and short executive-education programs or brief excursions like TED talks. Instead we need the kind of in-depth education and training people receive routinely at age 13.  In addition, we must recognize that economic upheaval at the macro level means turmoil and instability at the personal level. A lifetime of work will be a lifetime of change, moving between firms, jobs, careers and cities.  Each move has financial and personal costs: It might involve going without a paycheck, looking for new housing, finding a new school district or adjusting to a new vocation. We cannot expect to create a vibrant and flexible overall economy unless we make these shifts as painless as possible. We need a fresh round of policy innovation focused on creating a safety net that gives workers the peace of mind — and the money — to move deftly when circumstances change.  Finally, we can learn from the economist Joseph Schumpeter’s prescient analysis of entrepreneurs. He noted that for new innovations to spread and improve our lives, there will always be creative destruction. For new firms and sectors to arise, some of the old ones must die.  Even if we should be humble in predicting that self-driving vehicles will upend the trucking sector or drone delivery will decimate supermarkets, we can be confident that some creative destruction is coming.  Our current policies — and impulses — are to resist such destruction. If a large manufacturer is set to close, subsidies and other policies kick into action to prevent that shutdown. But while we may save a factory, ultimately we hinder the rise of new technologies; rather than propping up incumbent firms we ought to enable innovation to take its course.  If that idea makes you uneasy, it is probably because our current policies do nothing to protect the most vulnerable from the costs of all this destruction. We resist letting factories close because we worry about what will become of the people who work there. But if we had a social insurance system that allowed workers to move fluidly between jobs, we could comfortably allow firms to follow their natural life and death cycle.",3.0,1,[3.0]

And unlike many of its competitors, it builds both the truck cabs and components like engines and transmissions in the United States.  Mack is foreign-owned — by the Volvo Group of Sweden — but the parent company recently completed an $84 million project to modernize and expand the Macungie factory.

It was a Friday in late spring, and Ms. Quillen was about to join a conference call with one of the world’s largest parts suppliers. In the automotive food chain, big suppliers like Delphi and Johnson Controls constitute Tier One. They sell directly to the carmakers. D.E.P., which primarily sells to other suppliers, is in Tier Two.  “Tier Ones are eating whole peanuts,” Ms. Quillen says mordantly. “We take the crumbs.”  D.E.P. was trying to take some control over its destiny.  Ms. Quillen was proposing to make a new part used in the transmission of General Motors vehicles. It had taken weeks to design and fabricate a prototype. Now, the little part sat on a conference table in the Tier One’s offices outside Detroit.  Ms. Quillen apologized for dialing in rather than attending the meeting. But it was also true that her own office was where she felt most confident, seated at a large L-shaped desk. On her windowsill were two copies of “Lean In” by Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook. She had been reading the new Ivanka Trump book, “Women Who Work,” which she praised for “good information, good suggestions.”  She sees herself as a driver of people, as a manager who places great demands on her workers and on herself. Others could find her intimidating. On one of her two Dell monitors was a sticky note to herself: “It’s About Feelings.”  “I built a wall around myself,’’ she had said earlier, describing how she rescued the company from years of unprofitability. “If I had allowed myself to be vulnerable, you get hurt, and if you get hurt you start to lose confidence in your ability.’’  “It’s sad, but I became immune to people,” she said.  On the call, the Tier One executive, a woman, expressed interest in the part D.E.P. had designed, but said it would seek competing bids from other injection-molding companies, of which there were many. “It’s our policy that we have to market-test the part,” the executive said. “You’d be competing against other suppliers that have the same capability.”",2.5,1,[2.5]

And it is growing quickly, including far from its California headquarters, such as with 6,000 jobs in Austin, Tex., at an average salary of $77,000 a year, and many more indirectly through what it says is $50 billion in annual spending to suppliers in the United States.  “We’re responsible for creating over two million jobs in the U.S., across all 50 states,” said an Apple spokesman, “ranging from construction, customer care, retail and engineering to app development, manufacturing, operations and trucking. All Apple employees, whether full time or part time, are eligible for benefits and stock grants. We’re also fortunate to have skilled contractors that contribute to our products and services daily, along with over 9,000 suppliers in every state.”  Perhaps the biggest indictment of the more paternalistic approach taken by an earlier generation of corporate behemoths is that, Kodak, despite having been an early innovator in digital photography, is a shell of its former self. After a bankruptcy and many years of layoffs, the company now has only 2,700 employees in the United States and 6,100 worldwide.  But it is also clear that, across a range of job functions, industries and countries, the shift to a contracting economy has put downward pressure on compensation. Pay for janitors fell by 4 to 7 percent, and for security guards by 8 to 24 percent, in American companies that outsourced, Arindrajit Dube of the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and Ethan Kaplan of Stockholm University found in a 2010 paper.  These pay cuts appear to be fueling overall inequality. J. Adam Cobb of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and Ken-Hou Lin at the University of Texas found that the drop in big companies’ practice of paying relatively high wages to their low- and mid-level workers could have accounted for 20 percent of the wage inequality increase from 1989 to 2014.  The same forces that explain the difference between 1980s Kodak and today’s Apple have big implications not just for every blue-collar employee who punches a timecard, but also for white-collar professionals who swipe a badge.  Forklifts vs. 3D Maps  Phil Harnden was coming out of the Navy in 1970 when he applied for a job at Kodak, and soon was operating a forklift in a warehouse. He made $3 an hour, equivalent to $20 an hour today adjusted for inflation. That is roughly what an entry-level contracting job testing software pays.",3.5,1,[3.5]

The step was the first of several that President Emmanuel Macron and his government are planning to take to galvanize the French economy. It was cheered in European capitals, where an invigorated France is considered critical to the survival of a European Union that is finally showing signs of revival after a lost decade.  The changes to France’s labor rules, the Code du Travail, have proved contentious for Mr. Macron. The young president toppled the old political order with his election just three months ago and his popularity has already slumped in part because of the uncertainly surrounding his labor reform effort.  Economists in France and across Europe expressed optimism about the new law, however, suggesting that Mr. Macron had seized the moment just after his election, when the country might be more receptive to what was being characterized as a revolutionary change.",4.5,1,[4.5]

Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, and other policy makers will also be closely watching data expected on Friday morning from the Labor Department on hiring, wages and unemployment in August. Economists estimate that the economy added 180,000 jobs, but a stronger gain, like July’s 209,000 jump, or an uptick in wages, would focus more investor attention on the Fed’s next meeting on Sept. 19 and 20.  At a speech last week in Jackson Hole, Wyo., Ms. Yellen focused mostly on the continuing need for regulation, rather than the outlook for growth, but she did term the current economy “strong.”  On Wednesday, some economists offered improved expectations for job creation in August after the payroll processor ADP reported that private employers added 237,000 jobs, well above the 185,000 increase that had been expected.  The acceleration in spending suggests that a so-called Trump bump — improved sentiment among consumers and more optimism among business leaders — may be translating into concrete actions like homeowners buying new appliances and companies investing in new software or equipment.  “The consumer is in the driver’s seat in terms of economic growth,” said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. “It puts us on a stronger path going into the third quarter, although Hurricane Harvey introduces some uncertainty.”  Mr. Anderson expects growth in the range of 3 to 3.5 percent in the current quarter, but he said the hurricane could shave as much as 0.3 percentage points off that figure. A hit like that would mostly be reversed in the year’s final quarter as rebuilding efforts kicked in, he added.",4.5,1,[4.5]

According to census data Mr. Osterman analyzed, more than one-quarter of home health aides in 2015 were immigrants. The proportion in certain states is far higher, reaching nearly one-half in California and nearly two-thirds in New York.  The undoing of DACA may also herald the undoing of other programs that provide a steady source of immigrant labor in the health care sector. For example, the government can grant people from certain countries that have endured hardship, like natural disasters or civil wars, what it calls temporary protected status.  The overwhelming majority of workers granted that status hail from El Salvador, Honduras and Haiti, and many have flocked to low-paying health care professions as well.  “We know from surveys that T.P.S. recipients are highly represented in the work force in certain areas,” said Tom Jawetz, a vice president of the Center for American Progress, a think tank that favors more liberal immigration policies. “In particular, many — especially Haitians — work in home health care.”  The Trump administration has suggested it may not extend the program for Haitians when its most recent extension expires in January, raising questions about whether it will end the program for Hondurans and Salvadorans as well.  As a basic matter of economics, removing tens of thousands of workers from occupations that already suffer from a serious labor shortage — the Labor Department predicts that the country will need more than 1.25 million home health aides by 2024, up from about 900,000 in 2014 — generally has one unambiguous effect: driving up costs.",1.5,1,[1.5]

As for Ms. Yellen’s position, an administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday that the president was still reviewing candidates. Gary Cohn, the chief White House economic adviser, has been mentioned as a possible nominee. But a person close to the president said Mr. Cohn had fallen out of favor — although not totally out of the running — after expressing distress last month in an interview with The Financial Times over the administration’s response to violent clashes in Charlottesville, Va.  The Fed’s board had at least five members from 1936 until 2009. The head count was reduced to four during brief stretches in 2009, 2010, and 2014. But by far the longest stretch in Fed history with only four board members began in March of this year.  It is the first time that a majority of votes on the Federal Open Market Committee, which makes monetary policy, have been held by the presidents of the Fed’s regional reserve banks — who, unlike most officials with policy authority, are neither directly elected nor confirmed by the Senate. The committee includes the members of the board and the 12 reserve bank presidents, five of whom hold votes at any given time.  Mr. Fischer spent two decades as a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where his students included Mario Draghi, now president of the European Central Bank, and Ben S. Bernanke, Ms. Yellen’s predecessor as Fed chief.  Then, in the late 1980s, he embarked on a second career in public service, first as chief economist at the World Bank, then as a senior official at the International Monetary Fund and as governor of the Bank of Israel. By the time he arrived at the Fed, he was widely regarded as leading expert on both the theory and the practice of central banking.  Analysts said Mr. Fischer’s departure was unlikely to shift monetary policy in the near term. The Fed is widely expected to announce after its next meeting in mid-September that it will begin to reduce its holdings of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities.  The Fed has raised its benchmark interest rate twice this year, to a range between 1 percent and 1.25 percent. Most officials predicted in June that the Fed would raise rates one more time this year, but sluggish inflation could cause the Fed to hesitate.",3.5,1,[3.5]

For Mexico’s part, a top priority remains finding ways to incorporate President Enrique Peña Nieto’s 2014 energy program in a modernized Nafta. This would further open up Mexico’s energy sector to private investment and could reduce the United States’ trade deficit with Mexico.  While many details remain to be worked out, the course of the Nafta talks is also likely to be directed by politics and the passions of Mr. Trump. The decision on Tuesday by Mr. Trump to end the Obama-era executive action that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation could ratchet up tension between the countries. And Mr. Trump’s ongoing commitment to making Mexico finance a border wall rankles its leaders.  “It is hard to reconcile the political language of the U.S. leaders and their aggressiveness and their sense of being abused by Mexico in the relationship,” said Alejandro Gómez-Strozzi, Mexico’s undersecretary of economy from 2000 to 2006. “Nafta needs some improvement, but not in the light that is being portrayed by the U.S. president.”  Mr. Trump may have to decide if he wants to tweak the deal and call it a win, get bogged down in painstaking details or bail on Nafta entirely.  Most trade experts agree that achieving a major rewrite of Nafta in the next few months is a long shot, if only because most major trade pacts take years to reach. To veterans of big trade agreements, the lack of immediate breakthroughs is not necessarily bad news for Nafta, but the urge to rush the negotiations could prove to be counterproductive.  “As you’re thinking about the timetable, you need to make sure you have enough time to consult with Congress, consult with stakeholders and find creative solutions to new problems,” said Michael Froman, who was a trade representative under President Barack Obama.",2.5,2,"[3.5, 1.5]"
98,572,9,5,2017,2017-09-05,The New York Times,"Under Trump, Job Market Has Improved More for Clinton Supporters","Why are labor market gains tilting in a different direction than economic confidence? The rise in political tribalism in one obvious explanation for partisan differences in confidence in the economy.  But there are other reasons. The improvement in labor market outcomes for likelier Clinton supporters might, in part, be a closing of gaps that widened during the recession, such as racial differences in the unemployment rate. (Blacks, who tended to support Mrs. Clinton, endured more economic hardship during the recession than whites.) Also, economic confidence predicts actual behaviors weakly at best.  Debates continue about how much economics affected the 2016 vote, but an improving job market is both a core aspiration and a bragging point for incumbent politicians regardless of party. If jobs and wages matter in how Americans judge presidents and how they eventually vote, the post-inauguration decline and persistent partisan divide in Trump’s approval rating are all the more striking given the bigger economic lift received by likelier Clinton supporters.  Only seven months into the new administration, it’s far too soon to say whether the Trump years will eventually bring more jobs and higher wages to his base than to his detractors. But so far, the difference in labor market success has, if anything, gone in the opposite direction of the partisan swing in economic confidence.  Methodology  The Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates the official unemployment rate and other labor-market indicators from the monthly Current Population Survey (C.P.S.) of households. That survey does not ask respondents whom they voted for or which political party they belong to. But it does ask about demographic variables, including age; race and ethnicity; educational attainment; sex; marital status; presence of dependent children in the household; and state of residence. We used those variables — and the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, which includes more than 40,000 respondents who voted for Donald J. Trump or Hillary Clinton — to predict 2016 vote choice. “Likelier Trump supporters” and “likelier Clinton supporters” in the C.P.S. are defined based on their demographic similarity to actual Trump voters and actual Clinton voters in the C.C.E.S. Estimates of labor market indicators for each group are weighted by the probability of each C.P.S. respondent’s being a likelier Trump supporter or a likelier Clinton supporter. More details are available here; this academic paper takes a similar approach to voting prediction.",3.25,2,"[4.0, 2.5]"

But out of the ruin of the 1992 storm came changes that helped remake the way South Florida, the state and the rest of the country confront hurricanes.  “Andrew kicked our butts and we learned from it — basically in South Florida, people were running around like crazy, mostly in circles,” said Richard Olson, the director of the international hurricane research center at Florida International University. “It was a marker event in the history of South Florida and for Florida in general. Nothing was ever the same in terms of mitigation and preparedness.”  As Hurricane Irma trounced several Caribbean islands and headed for Puerto Rico on Wednesday, South Florida prepared for the possible landfall this weekend of a Category 5 storm with 185 mile-an-hour winds. State officials rolled out carefully detailed protocols for evacuations, storm surges, emergency response and power losses.  Gov. Rick Scott did not mince words: “This is a devastating hurricane,” adding that “the storm is bigger, stronger, faster than Hurricane Andrew.”  Andrew, which blew in 25 years ago, was the last Category 5 storm to hit the United States, and it clobbered south Miami-Dade County, flattening houses and buildings.  After the storm, South Florida approved a building code intended to make structures better withstand high winds. The state came to be seen as an international leader in storm preparation.  Laws were passed that required supermarkets, gas stations and hospitals to be equipped with generators so they could reopen quickly after a storm. Residents took outfitting their homes much more seriously. In addition to hurricane-impact windows, which are now common, many South Floridians bought hurricane shutters. Some have installed hurricane resistant roofs.  The storm also gave rise to the modern-day federal, state and local emergency response system.  Counties invested in rescue boats and vehicles, and began training teams of emergency workers in how to deal with big storms. Miami-Dade’s swift-response teams are part of a small, specially designated federal network. One of the teams, along with other Florida emergency medical workers, went to Houston after Harvey.  “Andrew kick-started the professionalization of emergency management in Florida and, really, elsewhere,” Mr. Olson said.  But emergency managers are the first to say that hurricanes are unpredictable and foolproof plans are fiction. Hurricane Irma is anticipated to be a wind and storm surge rather than a rainstorm, which plays to South Florida’s strengths, forecasters said. A sudden change — like Houston’s 50 inches in rain — can upend the playbook.  “You have plans in place; you do drills, you make your notifications,” said Pete Gomez, the city of Miami’s emergency manager. “Sometimes you can prepare for everything, and something else hits you.”  Mitch Landrieu, the mayor of New Orleans and the president of the United States Conference of Mayors, warned that “even the cities that are the most forward leaning, if overtaken by a massive event like a Category 5 hurricane with 185 m.p.h. winds, will likely suffered significant damage.”  “There are some things that will just not allow you to defeat Mother Nature,” he said.  Gerald Galloway, a specialist on flood risk and floodplain management at the University of Maryland, agreed. While lauding Miami’s attention to windstorm preparedness, he said that its residents are “probably more sensitive to what would happen than what we saw in Houston.”  A punishing surge could do tremendous damage, despite the attention to wind standards in construction. Another potential question, Mr. Galloway said, is how effectively the standards are put into place. “They are certainly more attentive to it — but are they enforcing it? I’m not sure.”  “Whether it will make much of a difference with Irma,” he said, “will all depend on what the nature of the event is, and where it is.”",3.5,2,"[2.0, 5.0]"

131,811,9,12,2017,2017-09-12,The New York Times,Median U.S. Household Income Up for 2nd Straight Year,"The good news is that income inequality, by some measures, is no longer increasing.  The details of the report help to explain the reasons. Household incomes increased because more people were working, and the gains in employment have been concentrated among workers with less education, driving income gains on the lower rungs of the economic ladder.  “Households are doing better because more people are working and more people are working full time,” said Jed Kolko, chief economist at the jobs site Indeed.com.  But the increases in household income also reflected investment gains. The share of income that came from sources other than wages increased markedly last year, to 21.8 percent, from 21.1 percent in 2015. That kind of income flows mostly to households on the upper rungs of the ladder.  Income inequality is at a very high level by historical standards. Some economists see evidence that the uneven distribution of income and wealth is an impediment to economic growth.  It also means the lives of Americans are increasingly different, depending on their economic fortunes. For example, mortality rates are climbing for middle-aged white Americans with no more than a high school education, a trend that the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, described this year as “very shocking.”  The Fed has curtailed its efforts to stimulate economic growth, concluding that monetary policy has done what it can. The Fed is expected to announce next week, after a meeting of its policy-making committee, that it will begin to reduce its bond holdings, a final legacy of its stimulus campaign.  While the distribution of income didn’t change last year, the rising tide lifted more people from poverty. The Census Bureau reported that 12.7 percent of households lived in poverty in 2016, representing a total of 40.6 million people. That was down from 13.5 percent of households and 43.1 million people in 2015.

The red lines from Democrats are becoming increasingly stark. Mr. Schumer also said that a repeal of the deduction for state and local taxes and any changes to the mortgage interest deduction would also be non-starters with Democrats.  Still feeling the sting from its failed effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act without the help of Democrats, the White House is trying to keep hope of bipartisanship alive.

But after months of deliberations, Republicans have yet to agree on their own plan.  On Tuesday, Mr. Mnuchin said that Mr. Trump and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan are not yet in accord on the corporate tax rate.

His critical view of capitalism was largely shaped by his disappointment that the United States, as he saw it, had failed to live up to its ideals.  “We thought we were liberating Europe and fending off the imperialism of feudal Japan,” Professor Dowd wrote in his autobiographical “Blues for America: A Critique, a Lament, and Some Memories” (1997), “but we turned up after the war occupying or controlling foreign countries all over.”",2.6666666666666665,3,"[4.5, 0.5, 3.0]"

For a while, it saw a clear pattern: Younger men could expect to make more over their lives than older ones. Every year the starting rewards were higher and kept growing. So men who turned 25 in, say, 1960 would end up with a higher median cumulative income by 55 than men who had turned 25 in 1959. And the ’59ers would, in turn, do better over three decades than those who had turned 25 in 1958.  But that steady progress stopped in the late 1960s. Then, instead of increasing, lifetime earnings for men made an about-face and began to decline. They have been dropping pretty much ever since. The result was that a 25-year-old man who entered the work force in 1967 and worked for the next three decades earned as much as $250,000 more, after taking inflation into account, than a man who had the same type of career but was 15 years younger.  “That’s enough to buy a medium-size house in the United States,” said Fatih Guvenen, an economist at the University of Minnesota and a co-author of the study. “That is what you are missing from one generation to the next generation.”  And the trend appears to be continuing. “Every new cohort made less in median lifetime income than the previous one,” Mr. Guvenen said.  The result is widening lifetime inequality as well. That’s because nearly all of the financial gains have been funneled to those at the top of the income scale. For four out of five men, there was no real growth.  “And it all starts at age 25,” Mr. Guvenen said. The decline in lifetime earnings is largely a result of lower incomes at younger ages rather than at older ages, he said, and “that was very surprising to us.”",2.75,2,"[1.5, 4.0]"

Still, any tax cut may wind up being temporary. Under existing Senate rules, Republicans can pass legislation with a simple majority only if the bill is not found to add to the deficit after a period of 10 years. That means all — or part — of the tax legislation could expire after a decade if official estimates of the costs do not align with Republicans’ optimistic economic growth projections.  Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee have been wrestling for weeks over how big a tax cut is feasible and have been under pressure to reach a budget deal this month so that the work on tax legislation can officially begin in October. Still, while the Republicans may coalesce around a $1.5 trillion tax cut, the details of the actual plan remain fraught with lawmakers divided on some key issues such as the corporate tax rate and which, if any, deductions will be eliminated or scaled back.  Some details of the plan are expected to be released next week when the “Bix Six” working group of Republican congressional leaders and the White House economic team outline their policy framework.  President Trump said this month that the wealthiest Americans might end up paying a bit more in order to lower tax bills for the middle class. A White House official said on Tuesday that while the rich would not see a benefit from the tax plan no final decisions on top rates had been reached.  Republicans have been wary of sharing too many details given the intense lobbying crush that is expected once it becomes clear which industries stand to win or lose valuable provisions currently ingrained in the tax code. Those include things like the mortgage interest deduction and the deduction for charitable donations.

But that trend faded around the turn of the century. Since then, the labor-force participation rate of prime-age Americans has shrunk to nearly the lowest in the industrialized world.  And, as Professor Krueger noted, once workers stop looking for a job, it is tough to draw them back in. “After they leave the labor market,” he said, “people reorganize their lives.”  Indeed. A third of the prime-age workers who have left the labor force are now receiving disability benefits, meaning they are out for good, Professor Krueger estimated. Another 20 percent are in the process of applying for such benefits. In a recently released study, he estimated that about a third of prime-age men not in the labor force use prescription painkillers, namely opiates, suggesting that they will not be returning to work soon. Professor Krueger suggests that the increase in opioid prescriptions could account for about 20 percent of the decline in men’s labor-force participation from 1999 to 2015, and 25 percent of the observed decline in women’s labor-force participation.  How to get them back? In a coming study, Melissa Kearney and Katharine Abraham of the University of Maryland identify forces that have pushed workers out of the labor force before the retirement age of 65. Trade is at the top of the list, followed by technology — be it robots or other forms of automation — and disability insurance, which offers people some income in the absence of a job. Supply-side factors — incarceration, or the effect of the minimum wage on labor costs — are next.  Professor Kearney and Professor Abraham also identify policies that might draw more workers back into jobs: Improving access to high-quality education, an elusive goal despite recent gains, is critical to equip students to navigate a changing workplace. So is access to child care, to lower barriers to women’s participation in the work force. Expanding wage supports like the earned-income tax credit will be important to make work worthwhile for workers of lesser skills. On the supply side, Professor Kearney and Professor Abraham suggest that being cautious about raising the minimum wage, which could price some workers out of jobs, and reforming disability insurance to encourage recipients to seek jobs.  There is more. Discouraging the overprescription of painkillers seems like an obvious choice, given Professor Krueger’s findings. There is also a clear list of things not to be done.  For instance, restricting immigration is not the smartest policy when workers are scarce. Raising barriers to imports — inviting retaliation from trading partners — is exactly the wrong approach, especially now that the workers in cheap labor markets that put such pressure on American jobs promise to become big consumers of things made in America.  If the goal is to protect economic growth and to give American workers a shot at a new golden age of employment, closing the door on the world economy is not the solution.",3.3,5,"[4.5, 1.5, 4.0, 3.0, 3.5]"

So why has the economic expansion since the recession been so tame, with sluggish productivity and, at least until recently, anemic wage growth?  Economists say the answer, to some degree, can be found in a start-up slump — a decline in the creation of new businesses — and a growing understanding of what’s behind it.  A total of 414,000 businesses were formed in 2015, the latest year surveyed, the Census Bureau reported Wednesday. It was a slight increase from the previous year, but well below the 558,000 companies given birth in 2006, the year before the recession set in.  “We’re still in a start-up funk,” said Robert Litan, an economist and antitrust lawyer who has studied the issue. “Obviously the recession had a lot to do with it, but then you’re left with the conundrum: Why hasn’t there been any recovery?”",2.0833333333333335,6,"[1.5, 2.5, 1.0, 3.5, 0.5, 3.5]"

Job growth remains strong, suggesting that the work force is still expanding; wage growth is modest, suggesting employers are still able to find workers with relative ease; and inflation weakened in recent months, puzzling Fed officials and economists who had predicted that prices would begin to rise more quickly as labor market conditions tightened.  The Fed’s preferred measure of price inflation increased by just 1.4 percent during the 12 months ending in July, the most recent available data. The Fed is likely to undershoot its target of 2 percent annual inflation for the sixth consecutive year. That has caused consternation among some economists and Fed officials, who are wary of raising rates given the Fed’s inability so far to achieve its inflation objectives.  “I can’t say this year that I can easily point to a sufficient set of factors” to explain low inflation, Ms. Yellen said Wednesday. She added, however, that low inflation this year did not imply low inflation next year. “What we need to do is figure out whether the factors that have lowered inflation are going to prove persistent,” she said.  Ms. Yellen said that weak inflation readings earlier this year “reflect developments that are largely unrelated to broader economic conditions.” Similarly, she said that the Fed expected the impact of hurricanes on gas prices to increase inflation temporarily. So far, the Fed’s assessment of underlying conditions remains unchanged: Ms. Yellen and her colleagues expect inflation to stabilize at its target of 2 percent a year.  The Fed wants to use its benchmark rate to manage economic conditions while gradually draining its investment portfolio in the background. When Ms. Yellen described the Fed’s plans in June, she expressed hope that the process would be like “watching paint dry.”  The Fed holds about $4.2 trillion in Treasury securities and mortgage bonds, which it accumulated to put downward pressure on interest rates. It must regularly replenish its holdings as bonds mature. Beginning in October, it plans to withhold $10 billion a month from the reinvestment process — in effect causing that much money to disappear.  It will then increase the pace by $10 billion each quarter until reaching a monthly rate of $50 billion, and then maintain that pace until it reaches an unspecified finishing line.",4.0,5,"[3.0, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0]"

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that the 10 largest tax expenditures (its term for what most people consider tax breaks) would amount to $12 trillion, or 5.4 percent of gross domestic product, over the decade from 2014 to 2023.  While such breaks may yield benefits, the budget office warned that they also “may lead to an inefficient allocation of economic resources by encouraging more consumption of goods and services receiving preferential treatment” and “may subsidize activity that would have taken place without the tax incentives.”  The report specifically cited the home-mortgage deduction as encouraging taxpayers to “purchase more expensive homes, investing too much in housing and too little elsewhere relative to what they would do if all investments were treated equally.”  But it’s mostly hard-core libertarians and free market purists who want to get rid of all tax breaks for the rich. The political reality is that some of these “expenditures” are off the table. The charitable deduction has proved untouchable for decades. The top 1 percent gave $77 billion in 2014, 37 percent of total charitable contribution deductions. Perhaps it’s not so bad for the rich to pay a lower marginal rate, if it’s because they give away so much.  So what’s left?  LONG-TERM CAPITAL GAINS The biggest revenue target is the preferential rate for long-term capital gains, which raises a perennial question: Why should capital income be taxed at a much lower rate than ordinary income? Capital assets are owned overwhelmingly by the rich. The top 1 percent reported $561 billion in capital gains taxed at the preferential rate, or 68 percent of the total. As a simple matter of math, the rich will never pay anything close to the top statutory rate as long so much of their income is taxed at a much lower rate (currently 20 percent for the top bracket, not counting the Affordable Care Act surcharge of 3.8 percent).  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the preferential capital-gains rate will cost the Treasury $1.34 trillion from 2014 to 2023.  “We’re taxing the rich much too lightly because we tax capital so much less than labor,” said Steven M.

We Asked Experts to Rate the Odds,"That tradition has helped keep the Fed, with its vast power over the economy and financial system, insulated a bit from politics, but President Trump has no obligation to follow it.  The case for renominating Ms. Yellen is straightforward.  She has presided over four years of steady economic expansion and rising financial markets. She moved cautiously toward raising interest rates even though the economy seemed to be approaching full employment. By contrast, some more conservative contenders for the job have indicated they want to raise rates more quickly, which could endanger the economy as President Trump approaches midterm elections in 2018 and a potential re-election battle in 2020.  After criticizing her during his campaign, President Trump has had some kind words for her, saying in July that he liked her and that “she’s done a good job.”  Moreover, as President Trump dabbles in making deals with Democrats, reappointing Ms. Yellen could serve as an expression of good faith to Democratic senators. As administration officials focus on tax legislation and other priorities on Capitol Hill, it might be helpful to them to nominate someone who might sail through confirmation, rather than demand a bruising, time-consuming battle.  “She’s a known quantity, and there is less risk of disrupting the financial markets if the president renominates Dr. Yellen,” said Brian Gardner, managing director of Washington Research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, and one of the panelists. “Although President Trump is unorthodox in many ways, every president wants calm financial markets.”  The case against Ms. Yellen is similarly straightforward: She is a liberal economist in a government dominated by conservatives. She is a cerebral academic serving during the presidency of a bombastic businessman. And she is a staunch defender of the work the Fed and other bank regulators have done to try to limit risk in the financial system — including in a high-profile speech last month — amid an administration focused on deregulation.

Economists view household lending as an appealing alternative to having banks shovel more money into unprofitable, debt-ridden state firms that cannot be closed because they provide jobs to millions of workers.  So far, consumer lending has helped Chinese consumers weather the gradual slowdown in the country’s economic growth in recent years. That is particularly true in places like Qiqihar, a city of five million in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang. The local economy took a hit last year when a large steel mill closed a big blast furnace and overstaffed communal- and state-owned enterprises pushed out more than 40,000 workers.  But even here, 500 miles north of China’s border with North Korea, the local economy seems to be rebounding from a slump two years ago, when the national economy was looking shaky. Walk out the front door of the recently completed high-speed rail station in Qiqihar and no fewer than 45 cranes are visible, erecting apartment towers and office buildings.

But while it used to be a marker of adulthood, now it is something more wait to do until the other pieces of adulthood are in place — especially financial stability. For people with less education and lower earnings, that might never happen.  College graduates are more likely to plot their lives methodically — vetting people they date until they’re sure they want to move in with them, and using birth control to delay childbirth until their careers are underway.  Less educated people are more likely to move in with boyfriends or girlfriends in a matter of months, and to get pregnant at a younger age and before marriage. This can make financial and family stability harder to achieve later on.  “It starts with moving in together quickly, for economic exigency reasons as opposed to relationship reasons,” Ms. Sassler said. “Then struggling with making ends meet and trying to manage this with a partner just elevates the challenges.”  Evidence shows that the struggles of men without college degrees in recent years have led to a decline in marriage. It has been particularly acute in regions where well-paying jobs in male-dominated fields have disappeared because of automation and trade.  In a working paper published in July, three economists studied how the decline in manufacturing jobs from 1990 to 2014, across industries and regions, “contributed to the rapid, simultaneous decline of traditional household structures.”  Labor market changes made men less marriageable, they concluded. There were fewer available men, because unemployment was associated with a rise in incarceration or mortality from drugs and alcohol.

And yet it would be a mistake to ignore the impact of a corporate ethos that has come to focus on rewarding shareholders and executives at the expense of any other consideration — be it workers’ welfare or even the company’s long-term sustainability. Indeed, workers today amount to little more than a line on the cost side of businesses’ balance sheets, with little claim to its prosperity.  Corporate profits have risen over the last quarter-century, as a share of the nation’s income, even as the workers’ share has shrunk. While executive pay has soared — padded with stock options and shares — the earnings of ordinary workers are below where they were in the 1970s. What’s more, the pensions that ensured workers a retirement perch in the middle class have been replaced by 401(k) savings accounts — which are cheaper for companies but put workers’ retirement prospects at the mercy of the stock market.  “How you divide the pie is a choice,” said Rick Wartzman, who heads the KH Moon Center for a Functioning Society at the Drucker Institute of Claremont Graduate University. “It is being carved differently.”  The change has happened across the board. In his book “The End of Loyalty,” published in May by Public Affairs, Mr. Wartzman lays out a shift in corporate culture both in success stories like Coca-Cola and General Electric and in less successful ones, like Eastman Kodak and General Motors. “For workers, the story was the same, whether they were working at a winner or a losing firm,” he said.  The good news is that it is not impossible to modify the behavior of the corporate leaders who have so drastically altered the contract with their work force over the last few decades. While it may be tempting to cast the new breed of executives as selfish villains who somehow lost their sense of right and wrong, the shift in their behavior responded to a shift in the incentives they faced. It was fed by a belief that snaked its way three or four decades ago from the halls of the University of Chicago through investment-bank trading floors and into the corner offices of corporate America: that the interests of corporate managers must be brought into tight alignment with those of shareholders. It was accompanied by one of the most destabilizing propositions in the modern history of corporate governance: This alignment was best achieved by paying corporate managers almost exclusively with stock.  Mihir A. Desai of Harvard Business School argues that this strategy amounted to outsourcing corporate compensation decisions to the capital markets — which have no way of telling whether the rise or fall in shares is caused by executives’ strategies or simply luck. This produced an enormous bubble in chief executive pay — which rose in tandem with the stock. It also made chief executives’ jobs more uncertain, vulnerable to market downturns. And it vastly distorted their behavior, putting every decision at the service of the share price at the close of the quarter.  Professor Desai points out that in the end, this structure does not really serve shareholders, at least not those with an interest in a company’s prosperity more than a few quarters down the road. “Capitalism seems to be serving managers and investment managers at the expense of shareholders,” he wrote.  Changing this behavior is not beyond the reach of policy. Just as changes in the tax treatment of executive pay in the 1990s encouraged stock-based remuneration, tax reforms might motivate corporate executives to invest for the long term rather than for an immediate stock bump — maybe even encourage stable employment and worker training. Until then, offering tax breaks to American corporations seems more likely to line the pockets of executives and shareholders than to improve their long-term prospects or the prosperity of their workers.",2.25,10,"[2.5, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5, 3.5, 0.5, 2.0, 3.5, 2.5, 0.5]"

As a result, private-sector employers needed to make their jobs more attractive to retain workers.  The government’s wage served as a de facto floor on the wage others could offer for similar work. Several studies found that the program caused local wages to increase 4 percent to 5 percent when it was active. In Indian states that carried out the program most effectively, the increase in the private-sector wage was even bigger.  That higher wage applied to a vast amount of private employment, so it has added up to a lot: For each $1 the government paid out in wages, workers earned an additional 50 cents to $4.50 from higher wages in private sector jobs. The Indian government, in effect, created a matching program: For each $1 it paid out, the private sector kicked in 50 cents to $4.50 more. And this from a government program that has many deficiencies in how it is run. It suggests that even if the United States were to provide health insurance in an inefficient way, the indirect benefits to consumers could be substantial.  Shaking up the private market is especially useful if the labor market isn’t very competitive to start with. Powerful employers in such a market can get away with paying a lower wage, allowing them to earn fatter profits (although this entails a probable sacrifice in output). Adding a public option to a market like this is not a zero-sum game where higher wages just shift money from employers to workers. Instead, with better paid workers, the size of the economic pie, or “surplus,” increases.  In fact, there is evidence that India’s workfare program has increased both wages and private employment levels. This result goes against the most familiar supply-and-demand reasoning that by increasing employers’ costs, a higher wage decreases employment. That reasoning breaks down when a market isn’t competitive. Lack of competition also helps explain the related counterintuitive finding that raising the minimum wage sometimes increases employment in supposedly efficient markets like the United States.  The story plays out similarly among grocery stores in Mexico. In work with colleagues, I found that the few stores that sell beans, vegetable oil and other food staples in Mexico’s poor, remote villages often have considerable market power. We studied a program in which the Mexican government trucked boxes of staple foods into villages and delivered them to poor families.  For those families, the main benefit was the free food, but there was another boon: Local stores responded by reducing prices, and those prices dropped the most in villages with relatively few stores and little competition.",3.125,12,"[0.5, 5.0, 2.0, 4.0, 5.0, 4.5, 2.5, 5.0, 3.0, 2.5, 0.5, 3.0]"

He warned that the United States could wind up facing an economic collapse akin to that in Venezuela, adding that Republicans in the House and Senate had not demonstrated that they possess “the intellectual understanding of the dangers posed by these deficits and accumulated debt.”  Mr. Trump, who has called himself “the king of debt,” may be setting the tone.  During his presidential campaign, he insisted that he could eliminate the national debt in eight years, even as he promised to protect Social Security and Medicare, programs that are projected to consume an ever larger share of federal spending as the country’s population ages.  After Mr. Trump struck a deal with Democrats on a short-term debt limit extension, Representative David Schweikert, Republican of Arizona, asked, “In this entire discussion, how many members have you heard, how many from the White House said, ‘We’re in the middle of a demographic crisis that’s going to crush us in just a few years; let’s get to work on it’?”  He left unsaid the answer to his question: Not many.

Just over half of American families — 52 percent — owned stock in 2016, the first time stockholders represented a majority of Americans since before the financial crisis. But only a relative handful of families own stock outside of retirement accounts, and even counting those accounts, their holdings are often small.

Americans are significantly less indebted than before the recession and, significantly, they are better able to afford the debts they have. The median borrower had debts equal to 95.1 percent of income in 2016; the figure was 111.1 percent before the recession and rose to 118.8 percent in the immediate aftermath. Moreover, fewer Americans report being late on debt payments, filing for bankruptcy or taking out high-interest payday loans.  One type of debt is still rising, however: student loans. More than 22 percent of families reported having education debt in 2016, up from 15 percent before the recession. The median borrower owed $19,000.

It is an important asterisk to one of the core elements of the plan: a desire to tax income of “pass-through” businesses such as partnerships at a rate of only 25 percent. Currently, such income is taxed at the owners’ individual income tax rate, which is as high as 39.6 percent (and would fall to 35 percent in the Republican plan).

While Republican leaders claim to be united on the tax plan, they must now sell it to lawmakers who have been deeply divided this year.

It also said that it would lower the ratio by 1.5 percentage points for banks with at least 10 percent of their loans in inclusive finance — a threshold that practically no banks meet in China except for a few small, mainly rural financial institutions, experts said.  In another move that makes the announcement this weekend different from past moves on reserve requirements meant to spur growth, the central bank said the rules would not take effect until the beginning of next year. In the past, such changes took effect immediately or within a few days. Delaying the start of the rule this time gives banks time to increase their lending to small businesses so they can qualify for the new reserve ratios.  Gary Liu, the president of the China Financial Reform Institute, a research group in Shanghai, said that the timing of the central bank’s action on Saturday, the day before China’s National Day holiday on Sunday and before a week when most of the country will be on vacation, suggested that the central bank was trying to show that it was following a broad Communist Party mandate to regulatory agencies to keep the financial sector stable ahead of an important political meeting.

The last thing we would want to do is pin our hopes on doing that again, just with some other technology.”  After winding down a road canopied by emerald-green trees, he passed the opening of the Great Bend Tunnel, during whose construction in the 1870s, as one legend tells it, the African-American folk hero John Henry beat a steam drill in opening a hole in the rock, only to die from his efforts. Minutes later, Mr. Conant came to Camp Lightfoot, which a nonprofit organization, Appalachian Headwaters, is turning into an apiary with an eye toward helping displaced coal workers and military veterans get into the honey business. Early next year, Mr. Conant plans to install solar panels on an old gymnasium, which now holds racks of wood frames for the hives.  Deborah Delaney, an assistant professor of entomology and wildlife ecology who oversees the apiary and bee program at the University of Delaware, said the area was well suited for a honey enterprise. It is largely forest, unsullied by the pesticides that threaten the insects in industrial farm areas, and it has plant species like black locust and sourwood whose honey can fetch a high price.  “This is bee paradise,” she said, sitting on the porch of the cafeteria building where a Patriot Coal banner hung askew on one wall. For now, Ms. Delaney and the program’s staff are getting the colony established on a hillside in 86 hives that buzz away behind electrified wire fencing to protect them from bears. Next spring, they plan to distribute about 150 hives to 35 beekeepers either free or through a low- or no-interest loan. Come harvest time, the beekeepers would bring their honey-laden frames to the camp for extraction and processing; organizers would pay them for their yield and then sell the honey to support the program.

Demand is strongest for the low-sulfur coal from the Powder River Basin straddling Wyoming and Montana, rather than what Appalachia produces. The new-energy industries cannot replicate what coal once did, economists say. Long-term jobs at the Wyoming wind farm would number in the hundreds at best, while the solar program thus far trains only 10 workers each year.  Even a coal boom wouldn’t create jobs the way it used to: like the steam drill that ultimately took John Henry’s place, new equipment and technologies have replaced workers in heavy industries. Production of coal, for instance, increased over all from the 1920s until 2010, while the number of jobs dropped to 110,000 from 870,000.  So interest in the bees has been high here. “Thought it was weird at first — bugs in a box in the backyard,” said Sean Phelps, 27, who left a secure job as a school janitor to work with the bee program.

Both groups give vastly less to candidates directly than they invest in outside spending, or expenditures made independent of a candidate often in the form of political advertisements.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The impact of gun silencers can be overstated.  Among the calls for tougher gun restrictions, Hillary Clinton tweeted on Monday to criticize a House bill that would make it easier to purchase gun silencers. “Imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer, which the N.R.A. wants to make easier to get,” Mrs. Clinton wrote the day after the massacre in Las Vegas.  Addressing other claims that were far more dramatic, The Washington Post Fact Checker awarded three Pinocchios out of four to statements that the gunshot suppressor makes the weapon “quiet.” Mrs. Clinton did not go quite that far.  It is not known yet exactly what weapons Mr. Paddock used in the shootings, but a federal law enforcement official said they included AR-15-style rifles.  A typical AR-15 produces a decibel level of around 167, “give or take depending on environmental conditions,” according to the Loadout Room, a gear review website. With an average gun suppressor or silencer attached, the rifle’s decibel levels lower to about 136 decibels. Unsilenced, the gun would be louder than a jet engine or fireworks at a very close distance. With a suppressor, it would be as about as loud as jackhammer.  Mrs. Clinton has a point that suppressors also make it harder to tell where gunshots are coming from, especially as was the case during the concert in Las Vegas, with its blaring music.  Given the many variables involved, it’s extremely difficult — if not impossible — to determine what impact a silencer would have had. But it would not have “silenced” the weapons.",5.0,1,[5.0]

For a generation, Republicans in Congress — often joined by conservative Democrats — have bottled up gun legislation, even as the carnage of mass shootings grew ever more gruesome and the weaponry ever more deadly. A decade ago, they blocked efforts to limit the size of magazines after the massacre at Virginia Tech. Five years later, Republican leaders thwarted bipartisan legislation to expand background checks of gun purchasers after the mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn.  Last year, in the wake of the Orlando nightclub massacre, they blocked legislation to stop gun sales to buyers on terrorism watch lists.  But in this week’s massacre in Las Vegas, lawmakers in both parties may have found the part of the weapons trade that few could countenance: previously obscure gun conversion kits, called “bump stocks,” that turn semiautomatic weapons into weapons capable of firing in long, deadly bursts.",4.5,1,[4.5]

It reflects maybe about 10 firms.”  Thirteen of the drugs, Dr. Gottlieb said, are “sole-source,” meaning the product is made only by one company. Those include H.I.V. medications, injectable drugs and sophisticated medical devices, although he did not name the products. The biggest problem, he said, was not damage to the factories, but the instability of the electric supply. Manufacturers are worried that a long-term lack of connection to a major power grid could jeopardize their products, and are also wary of relying on the more limited electrical grids that the territory is likely to activate as a first step to restoring power.  One of the drugs F.D.A. officials said they were concerned about was methotrexate, which treats childhood leukemia and other diseases. It has been scarce, off and on, for several years. Mylan makes the product in Puerto Rico, and all five manufacturers of the injectable form of the drug have reported shortages of the product, according to a list maintained by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists.  In a statement, Mylan did not address the methotrexate shortage but said it was “working closely with F.D.A. to help address drug shortage concerns.” Its plant has sources of water, electricity and communication, and the company said it is “working on ways to make them sustainable for manufacturing purposes.” Like other companies, it said it was focusing on helping employees and other residents of the island with basic needs, including chartering a cargo plane carrying essential goods to deliver to them.  Several pharmaceutical and medical device companies said that their factories were coming back on line with the assistance of generators and that they did not anticipate supply shortfalls.

I’ve Got a Few Ideas,"But raising rates for the highest earners would raise issues of fairness, since it would further penalize earned income, while leaving passive income like capital gains untouched. A higher tax bracket for the highest earners would have little impact on Mr. Trump, since he has relatively little earned income, as opposed to pass-through income and capital gains.  Still, to help pay for pro-growth corporate tax cuts, “I would have no problem raising capital-gains rates or creating a new bracket for the rich, or both,” Mr. Holtz-Eakin said.  Tax capital gains at death.  The appreciation of capital assets is already taxed at an extremely favorable rate compared to labor. That’s why the rich pay such a low effective tax rate no matter what their marginal tax bracket. Various justifications for lower capital-gains rates have been proffered over the years, none of them self-evident. But even conceding the wisdom of lower capital-gains rates, why should they never be taxed at all, even as they are passed from generation to generation?  The argument for taxing such gains seems even more compelling given the proposed elimination of the estate tax, which at least captures some capital gains among the wealthiest people.  “To take away the backstop of the estate tax without a tax on capital gains at death is crazy,” Mr. Rosenthal said.  During the campaign, Mr. Trump proposed a plan to tax capital gains in excess of $10 million at death. That would avoid shifting the burden from the very wealthy to the less affluent. Congress could even exempt family-owned farms and small businesses. (There aren’t that many valued at more than $10 million.)  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the exclusion of capital gains at death would cost the Treasury $644 billion from 2014 to 2023. How much of that could be recaptured depends on where the threshold is set (it certainly could be lower or even higher than the $10 million).

304,1638,10,5,2017,2017-10-05,The New York Times,Why Some Scars From the Recession May Never Vanish,"Other factors that could be keeping people out of the job market are also being examined. In a widely discussed paper earlier this year, for example, economists at the University of Chicago and other schools argued that some young men are opting out of the labor force to play video games. (Other economists are skeptical.) Some research has pointed a finger at the federal disability system: Nearly two million more Americans are receiving federal disability payments than when the recession began in 2007, an increase that some economists argue is a reflection of the benefits’ use as an alternative to work. Some research, however, has concluded that the increase in disability claimants is due mostly to an aging population and is, in any case, a small piece of the overall decline in employment.  Deeper changes in the structure of the American economy could also be playing a part. A variety of evidence, including declining rates of entrepreneurship and falling job turnover, suggests the nation’s economy has become less dynamic and flexible since 2000, which could have made it harder for workers and companies alike to adapt following the shock of a recession.  And the recession may have accelerated trends that were already underway: Research from Lisa B. Kahn, a Yale economist, and a co-author has found that companies had, in effect, taken advantage of the recession to replace workers with machines. That was particularly damaging for men without a college degree — a group that was already struggling before the recession and that has been especially slow to recover from it.  “We were on a kind of trend where that group of people was going to find it harder and harder to find productive outlets in the labor market, and the recession kind of accelerated that,” Ms. Kahn said. Had the change happened more gradually, Ms. Kahn added, workers might have had a chance to adapt and learn new skills; instead, the recession left millions of them jobless in an environment where there was little demand for their labor.  Work like that of Ms. Kahn and Mr. Krueger suggests that what begins as a cyclical recession-driven problem can harden into a permanent structural issue. That could carry a lesson for policy makers: If the United States no longer recovers as quickly from recessions as it once did, and if those slow recoveries can leave permanent scars on workers, then it is all the more important to kick-start the economy before too much damage is done.  Ben S. Bernanke, then the chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned during the recession and the recovery that workers who stayed unemployed too long might drift too far away from the labor market to return. Mr. Yagan’s research suggests that efforts by the Fed, Congress and the Obama administration to prevent that had not gone far enough.  Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. who is now with the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said Mr. Yagan’s research could be read as an indictment of economic policy after the recession. If Congress and the administration had been willing to act more aggressively, they might have avoided some of the long-lasting damage that has been done.",3.2758620689655173,29,"[5.0, 2.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.0, 0.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 2.5, 2.0, 2.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.0, 4.0, 2.5, 5.0, 5.0, 3.0, 1.0, 2.5, 3.0, 2.5]"

As a result, it is difficult to conclude whether a white job seeker succeeded — and a black one didn’t — because of discrimination. While statistical techniques can adjust for some of these factors — education, geography and the like — no analysis can account for all of them.  But the new research allows for a clearer conclusion: It appears to have documented straightforward discrimination.  As a real-world experiment, it built on earlier “audit experiments,” as they are known in social science. Perhaps the most famous is a study by Marianne Bertrand of the University of Chicago and Sendhil Mullainathan of Harvard (who is a regular contributor to this column). In that earlier experiment, Ms. Bertrand and Mr. Mullainathan sent fictitious résumés to employers, finding that people with white-sounding names were more likely to receive a positive response than those with black-sounding names.  The new findings provide further indication of the many ways in which discrimination shapes the lives of African-Americans. What’s more, when it’s harder to get your neighborhood librarian to respond to a simple email about opening hours, it’s not much of a leap to imagine other interactions — dealing with a computer help desk, the front office at a school or just the dry cleaner — that go less smoothly.  Economists tend to group explanations of discriminatory behavior into two buckets: taste-based and statistical. If a librarian chooses not to respond because a person is black, that’s taste-based discrimination. In common speech, there’s a simpler label: racism.  Statistical discrimination, on the other hand, occurs when a librarian uses a person’s name or race as a marker for other characteristics. Perhaps an African-American-sounding name signals that a person is more likely to be poor. The librarian happens to be biased against poor people. In this case, race is being used as a statistic for inferring poverty, and it’s the perception of poverty that causes the discriminatory behavior.  But two pieces of suggestive evidence in this study point to the problem here as being straightforward, taste-based discrimination.",2.638888888888889,36,"[0.5, 0.5, 5.0, 3.5, 5.0, 2.5, 1.5, 4.0, 2.5, 0.5, 4.5, 4.0, 0.5, 1.5, 3.0, 1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 0.5, 5.0, 3.5, 1.5, 5.0, 1.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 1.5, 4.5, 4.0, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 0.5]"

340,1677,10,6,2017,2017-10-06,The New York Times,What’s a Science Reporter to Do When Sound Evidence Isn’t Sound?,"I wound up perusing a massive 2009 book called “ ‘Non-Lethal’ Weapons,” with a chapter summarizing research on using sound to incapacitate people at a distance.  But there’s less than meets the eye. There’s a lot of wild rumor about secret weapons that can make brains explode or make people think there’s a voice inside their head. And while medical researchers have studied the effects of sound for decades, they’ve done so sporadically, leaving us with a very patchy understanding.  So I hit the phone. I didn’t want to talk with just anyone — I looked for people with lots of experience in research that had direct bearing on this question. I started with Timothy Leighton, whose job title at Southampton University is, literally, professor of ultrasonics and underwater acoustics. Better yet, Dr. Leighton has published the only thorough recent scientific review of the effects of environmental ultrasound that I’m aware of.  When I interviewed Dr. Leighton and others, I made clear I didn’t expect them to solve this mystery; I just wanted them to reconcile the question with what we know through science. Everyone I spoke with had been following the news, too, so in each interview we hit the ground running.  Spoiler alert: The consensus was that it was extremely unlikely the diplomats were the victims of a sonic weapon. It would be necessary to rule out less exotic possibilities before taking that one seriously. The notion has ricocheted like mad around the press, making it possible for readers to assume that it has been generally accepted by experts. But it most certainly has not. I’ll be curious to see if articles like mine can put the brakes on the speculation.  If the United States government ever does release the results of a detailed investigation, I would love to report on the case again. But, as the retired acoustics professor Steven L. Garrett pointed out, the chance to easily prove that a sonic weapon was involved — using a cellphone microphone — is long past. I may never get to write that follow-up.",4.5,3,"[3.5, 5.0, 5.0]"

Mr. Trump has established an easy rapport with “Chuck and Nancy,” as he likes to call Mr. Schumer, a fellow New Yorker, and Ms. Pelosi, of California. The three bonded last month over a dinner of honey sesame crispy beef in the White House, and their discussions have gone beyond the fiscal deal and how to protect young immigrants brought to this country illegally from being deported.  They have prodded Mr. Trump to put aside the Republican credo of “repeal and replace” in favor of more modest tweaks to the existing law. They have urged him to preserve subsidies, known as cost-sharing reductions, paid to insurers under the health law to help low-income consumers pay for out-of-pocket health expenses like co-payments and deductibles.  But Mr. Schumer’s quick rebuff of Mr. Trump on Friday shows the limits of the partnership. The senator has said that much will depend on whether the president keeps his promise to protect the young undocumented immigrants who are beneficiaries of the program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.  “Whether he pivots or not will be one of the most fundamental questions of this administration,” Mr. Schumer said recently. “It’s the $64,000 question. The only way it can happen is if we have a successful negotiation on DACA, and secondly whether we get health care.”  The president’s call is sure to further rankle Republicans, with whom Mr. Trump has had increasingly tense relations over their failure to knock down a key pillar of Mr. Obama’s legacy.  Mr. Trump’s latest move comes at a sensitive moment. The White House is working with Republicans on an ambitious plan to rewrite the tax code, perhaps the party’s last chance for a major legislative victory this year.",4.0,6,"[2.5, 2.5, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0]"

Before agreeing to provide legal status for 800,000 young immigrants brought here illegally as children, Mr. Trump will insist on the construction of a wall across the southern border, the hiring of 10,000 immigration agents, tougher laws for those seeking asylum and denial of federal grants to “sanctuary cities,” officials said.  The White House is also demanding the use of the E-Verify program by companies to keep illegal immigrants from getting jobs, an end to people bringing their extended family into the United States, and a hardening of the border against thousands of children fleeing violence in Central America. Such a move would shut down loopholes that encourage parents from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras to send their children illegally into the United States, where many of them melt into American communities and become undocumented immigrants.  “Now is the time for Congress to adopt these immigration priorities,” Marc Short, the president’s legislative director, told reporters during a conference call on Sunday night.

Ms. Raicovich said the decision regarding the Israel event, which was made by the board, simply had to do with an application of the museum’s space rental practice, which has not permitted art fund-raisers, auctions or political events. The board then decided to overrule its initial decision and allow the event upon realizing that a museum official had led the Israeli Ambassador to believe the rental would proceed.  “The decision was not anti-Semitic,” Ms. Raicovich said. “The accusation is very painful.

Announces Repeal of Major Obama-Era Carbon Emissions Rule,"The repeal proposal, which will be filed in the Federal Register on Tuesday, fulfills a promise President Trump made to eradicate his predecessor’s environmental legacy. Eliminating the Clean Power Plan makes it less likely that the United States can fulfill its promise as part of the Paris climate agreement to ratchet down emissions that are warming the planet and contributing to heat waves and sea-level rise. Mr. Trump has vowed to abandon that international accord.  It also is a personal triumph for Mr. Pruitt, who as Oklahoma attorney general helped lead more than two dozen states in challenging the rule in the courts. In announcing the repeal, Mr. Pruitt made many of the same arguments that he had made for years to Congress and in lawsuits: that the Obama administration exceeded its legal authority in an effort to limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. (Last year, the Supreme Court blocked the rule from taking effect while courts assessed those lawsuits.) A leaked draft of the repeal proposal asserts that the country would save $33 billion by not complying with the regulation and rejects the health benefits the Obama administration had calculated from the original rule.  Coal- and natural-gas-fired power plants are responsible for about one-third of America’s carbon dioxide emissions. When the Clean Power Plan was unveiled in 2015, it was expected to cut power sector emissions 32 percent by 2030, relative to 2005. While many states are already shifting away from coal power for economic reasons, experts say scrapping the rule could slow that transition.  Environmental groups and several states plan to challenge the repeal proposal in federal courts, arguing against Mr. Pruitt’s move on both scientific and economic grounds.  Industry groups cheered the announcement, but have also indicated that they would prefer that Mr. Pruitt replace the Clean Power Plan with a new, more modest regulation on power plants in order to blunt any court challenges.

436,1781,10,5,2017,2017-10-05,The New York Times,New Species of Sponges Found on the Pacific Seafloor,"Plenaster craigi grow on the nodules and are vulnerable if mining for nodules commences. “We have collected a few hundreds of this sponge species and they were only found attached to the nodules,” Dr. Lim said.  “The C.C.Z. is a soft sediment habitat so the hard surfaces are limited,” Dr. Beaulieu said. While almost nothing is known of Plenaster craigi – what they eat, how they reproduce, where they are distributed – most sponge species, like corals, have to find hard surfaces to settle down on and grow while they are young, she said.  But the C.C.Z. is so vast, Dr. Glover believes that it is more likely large areas would be left undisturbed. The International Seabed Authority has already reserved wide swaths of seafloor for protection and commissioned large-scale exploration studies to establish life on the seafloor. “To get to the point where you can make informed decisions, you need to know what animals live there,” Dr. Glover said.  More pressing are the huge sediment plumes that mining activities will generate, says Ann Vanreusel, a marine biologist at Ghent University in Belgium. That’s where Plenaster craigi could prove to be useful as an indicator species because of its abundance, she says. “Every animal you collect from the seafloor seems to be a different species,” Dr. Vanreusel said. An organism that will clearly be disturbed from the plumes and abundant enough to count such as Plenaster craigi could help researchers figure out the effects of deep-sea mining and perhaps even the possibilities for recovery, she said.  “They can almost act like a canary,” Dr. Amon said.  But the key, Dr. Hannington said, is that deep-sea mining may not be economically viable. “Nobody has proved it can be done,” he said. Many details, like whether the metals can be extracted from the marine ore, still need to be worked out, he said. “If it turns out that marine mining is not economically feasible, all of the other problems go out the window.”  Dr. Glover’s team first noticed Plenaster craigi while on the 2013 expedition to the exploration area allocated to the United Kingdom. “For three years we were calling them sponge species A,” Dr. Glover said. Then in 2015, Dr. Lim participated in the second expedition to the area allocated to Singapore and began working with Dr. Glover to identify and classify the sponges. Now, Dr. Lim has begun work on a second sponge species growing on the nodules, while Dr. Glover is preparing an extensive study on deep sea mollusks.  The researchers are racing against time to study life on the seafloor while being limited not only by sample collection, but also a lack of scientists with the expertise to characterize and classify new species, Dr. Beaulieu said. “It takes a lot of time, one by one by one, to describe a new species,” she said, “and there are still so many to go.”",4.25,12,"[3.5, 5.0, 4.0, 4.0, 5.0, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.0]"

Mr. Shah said when he noticed the ripped video, he wrote to the administrator of the United Muslims account, asking them to add the link to his original YouTube video. His main concern, Mr. Shah said, was that the page was stealing his views. Told that his video had been used by Russian accounts to sow division in the United States, Mr. Shah said there wasn’t anything he could do about it.  “There are always going to be people who manipulate things to their agenda,” he said.

446,1795,10,9,2017,2017-10-09,The New York Times,Trump’s Argument Against Immigrants: We’ve Heard It Before,"Now here is Mr. Trump, who built his presidential run on a promise to build a border wall, and who began his campaign by attacking Mexico as supposedly an exporter of rapists and other criminals. As in 1994 California, the anger is directed powerfully at those arriving without documentation. Last month, though suggesting he was open to compromise, the president announced he would end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, the Obama-era program that protected immigrants who were brought to this country illegally as children.  The Trump assault, however, extends to all forms of immigration. In August, he embraced proposals to cut lawful entries in half over the next decade. Preference would be given to people possessing special skills and higher education — hardly the tired, the poor and the wretched refuse embraced in “The New Colossus,” the Emma Lazarus poem affixed to Miss Liberty’s base.  Two weeks ago, Trump administration officials disclosed their intention to cap refugee admissions at 45,000 over the next year. That would be the lowest ceiling, by far, since a 1980 law gave the president authority to help set limits on those searching for a haven from persecution in their own countries.  Surveys show that Mr. Trump’s “America first” sloganeering helped him eke out victories in November in critical swing states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, where some longer-term residents are uncomfortable with rising numbers of Latino newcomers. Sudden diversity is rarely simple. For some, it is scary.  But California in the wake of Proposition 187 may point to where the country as a whole is headed. The most populous state has undergone a profound demographic shift since the mid-1990s. Latinos now have a plurality; they and Asian-Americans combined are the majority. Non-Hispanic whites account for less than 40 percent.  As the video shows, Latinos in California are registering to vote in ever larger numbers, though whites are still more likely to go to the polls. The Latino representation in the legislature grows as well, to include prominent figures like State Senator Kevin de León. He said that many Californians, and not just Latinos, have had “enough with the scapegoating” of certain ethnic groups whenever the state has economic or other troubles.  Now California is cerulean blue politically, and there lies a cautionary tale for Republicans. With demographics changing almost everywhere, they may yet find that the short-term gain of the Trump 2016 victory comes at their long-term expense.  Still, dispelling xenophobia is no easy matter: “Immigration is one of those touchy issues for Americans that can suddenly turn ugly and flower into a major national argument.” That was from Charles Wheeler, speaking in 1994 as executive director of the National Center on Immigrant Rights.

The initial reaction from the Greens indicated that reaching an agreement on limiting the number of refugees could prove difficult.  “When you throw together asylum seekers, refugee contingents, resettlement programs and family members joining refugees all in one pot, and then set a limit of 200,000, one group will be thrown under the bus,” said Simone Peter, a co-leader of the Greens. “I would like to see how that can go along with humanitarian immigration.”  The numbers seeking refuge in Germany have fallen drastically during the last year, after Balkan countries began refusing people the right to cross illegally and after Europe reached a deal with Turkey to stem the flow. Fewer than 124,000 people applied for asylum in Germany in the first eight months of this year.  As part of their agreement, the conservatives also proposed legislation to allow for immigration of workers, in consultation with industries that have jobs to fill. More than 773,000 jobs were available last month, according to figures released by Germany’s labor office.  Further measures would include establishing more centers to process and assess arrivals’ applications. Those who are rejected would be returned to their home countries — an effort which would be sped up.  Among those destinations are Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, which, until now, have been considered too dangerous for deportations.

Without explicit evidence of a breach by the Iranians, and given Europe’s support for the deal, there appeared to be little appetite among Republican leaders to pull the plug on Mr. Trump’s behalf.  “As flawed as the deal is, I believe we must now enforce the hell out of it,” Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said on Wednesday. He urged Mr. Trump to provide Congress with clear instructions for what he was trying to do.  “Whatever he decides, it is critical that the president lay out the facts,” Mr. Royce said. “He should explain what his decision means, and what it doesn’t.”  Mr. Royce and others in the House have argued instead for stepped-up enforcement and the enforcement of additional, targeted sanctions against Iran’s missile program and Hezbollah. Lawmakers were also preparing for the possibility that Mr. Trump could simply ask them to amend the law that requires him to recertify the deal every 90 days.

The account noted that all participants agreed that economic activity during the summer months was in line with the Fed’s expectations “and that the incoming data had not materially altered the medium-term economic outlook.”  The Fed expects the recent hurricanes to bring down the figures for third-quarter growth, but it anticipates a rebound in the fourth quarter and little impact from the storms going forward.  The issue is the behavior of inflation. The Fed aims to keep inflation at an annual pace of about 2 percent, but it has undershot that goal consistently since the financial crisis, and the Fed says it expects to miss the target again this year.  A majority of Fed officials, led by Ms. Yellen, continue to subscribe to the view that inflation is just around the corner.  “Many participants continued to believe that the cyclical pressures associated with a tightening labor market or an economy operating above its potential were likely to show through to higher inflation over the medium term,” the account said.  Those officials want to raise interest rates so long as the economy keeps growing.  “The Fed’s models tell them that an economy at full employment eventually produces more inflation down the road and they want the Fed funds rate to be back to normal levels before that happens,” said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group.  Some also want to raise rates because they are concerned that markets are not responding to the Fed’s pressure.

That fits with what we have seen this year: a remarkable number of the strongest storms.  “Any given season could have waters that are warmer or cooler than average,” Mr. Henson said, but these ordinary seasonal variations are occurring on top of a long-term warming trend. These two elements can combine to produce monstrous storms like Hurricane Irma — which was one of only five known to have reached wind speeds of 185 miles per hour, and which sustained those winds for a record 37 hours.  Generally, hurricanes can develop when the water beneath them is about 79 degrees Fahrenheit or higher, Mr. Henson said, and climate change is increasing both the number of days that present those water temperatures and the size of the areas that have them.  Joel Myers, the founder and president of AccuWeather, emphasized that “we don’t have enough data” to attribute the intensity of this year’s hurricane season specifically to climate change as opposed to ordinary variables, like water temperature cycles that occur over 20 to 40 years. And he noted that in the northwestern Pacific Ocean (where hurricanes are known as typhoons), activity has been below average.  What is clear is that this year, warm waters have combined with atmospheric conditions to produce an exceptionally destructive Atlantic hurricane season. Wind shear has been very low, Mr. Henson said, which has allowed tropical systems to intensify “without being tilted, sheared, torn apart by stronger winds.” And steering currents have tended to drive storms over land rather than pushing them out to sea, creating an enormous human toll.  Mr. Myers pointed to the same factors, plus two more. A high-pressure area in the Atlantic has been farther north than usual, he said, essentially expanding the tropics and creating a larger space in which conditions are favorable for hurricanes.

In principle, the answer in the N.F.L. and elsewhere may be: Quite far.  To the extent that most people think about the reach of federal labor law, they probably imagine a union context — like organizing workers, or bargaining as a group across the table from management.  As it happens, the law is much more expansive, protecting any “concerted activities” that employees engage in to support one another in the workplace, whether or not a union is involved. The National Labor Relations Board and the courts have defined such activity to include everything from airing complaints about one’s boss through social media to publicly supporting political causes that have some bearing on one’s work life.  The league’s operations manual says players must be on the sidelines during the anthem and should stand.

Credit Michel Depardieu/Inserm  The question of whether animals dream was asked millenniums ago by Aristotle and has since occurred to virtually anyone who has watched a pet twitching in a deep sleep. Dr. Jouvet, who cautioned that there was no way for people to know for certain whether animals have what we call dreams, made a startling discovery while observing their behavior with his fellow researchers.  When certain minute structures within a cat’s pons were destroyed in experiments, he found, the cat began to move during periods of REM sleep — movements suggestive of walking, stalking prey, grooming or acting aggressively — all without reacting to outside stimuli.  The cat was exhibiting what Dr. Jouvet called “oneiric behavior,” meaning behavior related to dreams, using a word derived from the Greek word for dream, “oneiros.” He theorized that what had been destroyed in the experiments were the cerebral structures that had inhibited the cat’s motion while it was sleeping, and that the cat had been reacting to its dreams physically.  “How can we wake a cat during paradoxical sleep and ask it questions?” Dr. Jouvet wrote. “We cannot, but the discovery and analysis of oneiric behavior would lead us to believe that cats do dream.”  In 1986, many years after Dr. Jouvet’s discovery of oneiric behavior in cats, a study by Carlos Schenck and Mark Mahowald at the Minnesota Regional Sleep Disorders Center in Minneapolis pointed to a similar phenomenon in humans. The study detailed a medical condition called REM behavior disorder, in which a sleeping person acts out violently in the throes of a vivid dream.

European regulators, knee deep in a campaign to stamp out tax avoidance, have their own plans for that money.  Last week, for instance, the European Commission billed Amazon for $293 million in unpaid taxes in Luxembourg, arguing that the country’s failure to collect the tax amounted to an illegal state subsidy. It also took Ireland to court for not following up on the $15.2 billion tax bill imposed on Apple last year.  “The Europeans are targeting U.S. dollars overseas that the U.S. believes should be taxed here,” said Dave Camp, a former Republican representative from Michigan who was chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and the author of an unsuccessful tax overhaul in 2014. “We have to address this problem before the Europeans get there first.”  The rulings on Amazon and Apple — which those companies are disputing — are byproducts of a race among governments to lure corporate giants to their shores in the hunt for new sources of revenue.

There is a cable from the Central Intelligence Agency to its officers in Santiago after a failed operation in October 1970 to prevent Allende from assuming office, which he did that November. The C.I.A. provided weapons for the plan, which resulted in the killing of the commander in chief of the army, Gen.

Truancy charges landed him in juvenile detention in his early teens.  “Chaotic — there is no other way to describe my childhood,” he said. “I always felt alone.”  Given his history, it perhaps comes as no surprise that he has spent as much of his adult life in prison and in drug rehab as he has spent out.  Mr. Sullivan acknowledges that he has “made my own trouble” and “done stupid things.” But in a justice system built upon the idea of choice and personal responsibility, experts say the path to trouble may begin long before an individual has any say in the matter.

Musicians taking the long view  The underpricing of popular concert tickets is nothing new. In an earlier era, this was visible in long lines of fans camping out to buy them. Now, the gap between fans’ willingness to pay and the official price drives online ticket marketplaces, and a constant cat-and-mouse game pitting concert promoters against ticket brokers. And Mr. Springsteen’s show is grappling with the same challenge that “Hamilton,” and other hot tickets on Broadway have faced: limited seating, seemingly limitless demand.  Research by the economists Marie Connolly of the University of Quebec and Alan Krueger of Princeton based on a sample of major concerts in 2006 estimated that artists and promoters left about 5 percent of potential income (or around $200 million) on the table by underpricing tickets relative to the market rate.  Some in the music business see this as the height of irrationality. “Most concert tickets are not priced to market,” said Marc Geiger, a leading agent to musicians with WME Entertainment. He described showing an artist that the front-row concert tickets, priced flat at $125, were selling for $900 to $1,300 on the secondary market.  “I say, please, let me take some of those and price them at market,” Mr. Geiger said at the Music Industry Research Association conference in August in Los Angeles. Confoundingly, he said, the same artist might chafe at discounting the back rows of an arena to ensure a sellout, for fear of appearing to give away tickets too cheaply.  “We are still coming out of the era of rock ’n’ roll socialism,” he said. “I think the concert industry is still in a bit of head-in-the-sand economics.”  But given that the apparent underpricing has been so widespread and so persistent, is it possible the strategy is more rational than it seems?

The Fed’s sensitivity to those short-term fluctuations are an effort to explain why inflation remains sluggish. You’re rejecting the explanation but not offering an alternative.  A. A mystery is unsatisfying. You always like to have an end to the book. My own view as of now would be that, more than likely, we’re going to find that it’s temporary. We’re seeing wages and salaries go up. That’s consistent with a labor market that’s gotten tight enough that it’s starting to be reflected in wages and salaries. If a year from now you’re at the conference and we’re still undershooting on inflation and wages and salaries went down, then I have to come up with another explanation. I’m not expecting that.  Q. So the Fed should keep raising its benchmark rate?  A. If at the end of the next year we were at the point where inflation was around 2 percent and the unemployment rate was below 4 percent, I’d be concerned if we hadn’t moved to remove accommodation.  Q. It’s hard to know what to make of the Fed’s forecasts given that the central bank’s leadership could change completely in the next few months.  A. Chairs do matter. But it is a committee that’s making this decision. I wouldn’t expect a dramatic divergence from what we’ve been doing over the recent period. The staff stays the same, the presidents stay the same. We’ll have some new governors but I would be surprised if there are dramatic shifts in what we’re doing. I think it’s more likely we would see changes over time if there was somebody that had a different view about what we should be doing, and other governors with that same view came onto the committee. But I agree it’s harder to forecast what monetary policy will be when you don’t necessarily know who the chair or some of the governors will be in key slots, including the vice chair.  Q. Where should the interest rate be at the end of 2018?  A. If the data comes in as I’m expecting, that would be consistent with having something much closer to 2 percent on the federal funds rate.  Q.

Ryan of Wisconsin — two Republicans unlikely to initiate a lawsuit against a Republican president — and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, two Democrats now leading the minority, with hopes of claiming the majority in 2018.  The 2016 decision by Judge Rosemary M. Collyer that the health care spending was unconstitutional and that the House could pursue the lawsuit was at only the district court level, and its reach was viewed as limited. The judge also said the unique circumstances of a case testing the authority of the congressional power of the purse — its most fundamental constitutional role — had led her to grant standing, suggesting she did not mean to bestow expansive new legal rights on Congress.  Still, the decision alarmed the White House sufficiently that it rapidly pushed forward with an appeal both to preserve its independence and to protect the health care law.  The decision by the Justice Department to drop its defense of the Obama program and cut off the subsidies was not unexpected. Since President Trump took office, his administration has shown little interest in taking up the Obama administration cause. Quite the contrary. Given their strong opposition to the Obama health care program, the Trump administration and House Republicans asked the appeals court to hold off on any action in the lawsuit until Congress decided what to do about the health care law. Unable to force through a repeal, the administration has now turned to other actions it can take, with the decision to cut off the subsidies just the latest one.  How the court case will ultimately be disposed of remains unclear. Nicholas Bagley, a University of Michigan law professor who has followed it closely, expects that the Justice Department will move to have it declared moot, since the main point of contention — the legality of the subsidies — has been settled by the new finding by Mr. Sessions.  “There is nothing left to fight about,” Mr. Bagley said.  It might not be so simple. A coalition of states successfully intervened in the lawsuit this year in an effort to protect consumers when it became clear that the Trump administration was not inclined to contest the House claim. Mr. Bagley said the states could ask the appeals court to block the Trump administration from cutting off the funding. In addition, insurance companies could go to court to recover the subsidies they had been promised under the law. There are also bipartisan efforts in Congress to formally appropriate the money.  One thing is clear: With the House and the executive branch now on the same legal side, there is no longer any separation between the two main powers in the case.",4.2727272727272725,11,"[4.0, 4.5, 4.0, 4.0, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 2.5, 4.5, 5.0, 5.0]"

Asked if he still supported a pathway to legal status for illegal immigrants, which he once vocally championed, Mr. Gillespie unenthusiastically confirmed that he did, deflating his answer by noting that “the debate is 10 years old from my perspective.” (He did more readily note that he supported “accommodating those who were brought here as children illegally,” the so-called Dreamers.)  Mr. Northam, for his part, also does not quite seem sure how he should handle Mr. Trump. Appearing earlier this month at a Falls Church shopping center that is a hub for the Vietnamese community, he alluded to “bigotry” in last year’s campaign without mentioning Mr. Trump by name. But his remarks were tame compared to those by the state legislator who introduced him and called Mr. Trump’s election “the world’s largest nightmare” and scorned the president as a “draft dodger.”",3.6,5,"[3.5, 2.0, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5]"

In an unexpected announcement, Airbus and Bombardier, which is based in Montreal, formed a partnership on Monday to make and sell the CSeries airliner. Airbus will hold 50.1 percent of the venture but will not make any payment, future investment in the project or assume any debt related to the airliner, which has cost more than $5 billion to develop and put into production.  The arrangement gives Bombardier a way to make an end-run around two preliminary trade rulings that, if finalized, would impose tariffs that would more than quadruple the cost of the airliner in the United States, its key market. The two companies said they would move swiftly to open a CSeries assembly line in Mobile, Ala., where Airbus already makes its A320 airliners, that would most likely allow planes made there to avoid the enormous import duties.  Tom Enders, the chief executive of Airbus, and Alain Bellemare, his counterpart at Bombardier, told reporters that the agreement was not related to the trade action brought by Boeing. But they also said that many airlines had shied away from the CSeries because of concerns about the future of the project, which has been troubled by cost overruns and delays, and the future of Bombardier itself.",3.392857142857143,28,"[3.5, 2.5, 5.0, 1.0, 4.5, 2.5, 4.0, 1.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.5, 4.5, 2.5, 4.5, 3.0, 2.5, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 3.0, 4.0, 2.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.0]"

714,2127,10,17,2017,2017-10-17,The New York Times,"Why the Trade Deficit Matters, and What Trump Can Do About It","Economists’ standard explanation of international trade says that rich countries like the United States will export capital, of which they have a lot, lending to poorer nations that have little capital but a lot of cheap labor. These poor countries, in turn, will invest the borrowed money in American-made machines for factories in which to employ their workers. So the lending will generate exports for the United States — building a trade surplus.  Most developed nations adhere to this pattern most of the time. The European Union now has a current account surplus. If it weren’t for the United States, so would the G7 group of major industrialized countries. But since 1980, the United States has found itself mostly on the borrowing end of the deal. It has used the foreign capital to finance investment at home, racking up huge trade deficits along the way.  Some economists will argue that the trade deficit is ultimately irrelevant if there is sufficient money coming in from abroad to pay for it at a reasonable interest rate. So what if China owns a ton of Treasury bonds? Even fears that it might dump them to hurt the United States ignore that China has little incentive to do that. It would amass enormous losses, too.  But it is a mistake to ignore the wounds caused by persistent trade imbalances on American workers.  The trade deficit hasn’t had a uniform effect across the economy. As it soared over the last half century, it was workers in industries that compete with imports — like manufacturing — who lost out. And employment shifted to industries that were not exposed to trade.  Even if trade with China did not reduce overall employment, convincing new research shows that the two-decades-old flow of imports from China caused lasting damage to communities where industries that competed with Chinese goods lost out and whatever new jobs emerged couldn’t match the quality of those lost.  The money from China that financed the American trade deficit also financed the housing bubble, holding interest rates down in the run-up to the financial crisis of 2008. “China did not force our banks to make stupid subprime loans, but it enabled the macroeconomic conditions,” Mr. Bergsten said.",3.163265306122449,49,"[0.5, 2.5, 4.0, 3.0, 5.0, 3.5, 5.0, 2.5, 1.0, 4.5, 2.5, 4.5, 4.5, 2.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.5, 5.0, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 3.0, 1.5, 1.0, 3.0, 4.5, 0.5, 2.5, 1.0, 3.5, 1.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.0, 2.5, 1.5, 4.5, 3.5, 0.5, 5.0, 0.5, 4.0, 1.5, 2.5, 2.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 3.5]"

His first book, “Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos,” recounts the birth of cosmology through the personal dramas of its founders and was nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1991. And in 2014, he was named a Pulitzer Prize finalist for his reporting on the race to discover the Higgs boson, which focused on the lives of just a handful of the thousands of scientists swept up in the search for “the God particle.”  Once Mr. Overbye identifies a story, he said, the work is in putting it in terms people can understand. “Metaphors are very important to the way I write,” he said. The results are vivid descriptions that surpass mere translation. Einstein’s epiphany that space-time is distorted by gravity, for instance, renders the universe as “the ultimate sagging mattress,” and elementary particles derive mass from the Higgs boson “the way politicians draw succor from cheers and handshakes at the rope line.”  “I once compared the Milky Way galaxy to a piñata that the Kepler spacecraft had whacked and hundreds or thousands of new planets had fallen out,” Mr. Overbye said.

At times like these, when the economy is strong and unemployment is low, research has found that death rates rise.  At least, in the short term. In the long term, economic growth is good for health. What’s going on?  One study of European countries just before and during the Great Recession found that a one-percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate is associated with a 0.5 percent decline in the overall mortality rate. Other studies of Europe during different periods, as well as those of the United States, found a similar relationship between joblessness and mortality.  This is counterintuitive, since economic growth is a major factor in higher living standards. When the economy is more productive, we have more resources to promote health and well-being.  But a surging economy does more than generate greater income. An industrial economy also pumps out more air pollution as more goods are produced. Polluted air, it turns out, is a major contributor to the mortality-increasing effect of an economic boom. In their analysis of how economic growth increases mortality, David Cutler and Wei Huang, of Harvard University, and Adriana Lleras-Muney, of U.C.L.A., found that two-thirds of the effect can be attributed to air pollution alone.",2.25,10,"[0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 3.0, 5.0, 3.5, 5.0, 3.0]"

Insurers and other experts who testified before the Senate health committee said such a program could help substantially lower premiums. But states may be able to use innovation waivers to establish such programs themselves. Alaska has already had such a waiver approved by the Trump administration.  The insurers were generally supportive of the plan, and one of the main associations, America’s Health Insurance Plans, came out with a statement in favor of the proposed bill. But some emphasized that the legislation does not fix all of what ails the market. “We’ve stated repeatedly that the individual market is not stable,” said Joseph R. Swedish, the chief executive of Anthem, a large for-profit insurer that offers Blue Cross plans in several states, although he praised lawmakers’ efforts to provide more certainty in 2019.  The deal’s prospects in Congress remain uncertain. Though some senators from each party have endorsed its approach, several Republicans have spoken out against it. In the House, a spokesman for Speaker Paul Ryan said that “the Senate should keep its focus on repeal and replace of Obamacare.”  But even if the deal moves forward quickly, it is unlikely to affect next year’s health plans. Carriers in most states have raised their prices substantially to make up for the canceled federal payments, and there is little time for them to lower them again if the payments are restored. (The draft bill tries to address this problem, by asking states to establish a new rebate program, where carriers who get paid twice would need to pay back the federal government.)  “For 2018, it probably won’t happen in time,” said Timothy Jost, an emeritus professor of law at Washington and Lee University, who monitors health legislation closely. “The carriers are thinking now about 2019, and it’s very important for 2019.”  Insurance plans for each year go on sale during the prior fall, but the process of devising plans and setting prices begins months earlier. This year, many current insurers announced their exits from the 2018 Obamacare markets months ago, some explicitly naming President Trump’s threats about the cost-sharing payments as a reason. Analysts said it was unclear whether the plan might lure reluctant insurers back into the markets, but they said the funding would cause many insurance premiums to fall in 2019.  But the lengthy planning process of insurers means that the proposed bill’s two-year funding cycle could lead to another round of price increases in 2020, if an extension bill isn’t passed far in advance.

An abrupt departure by Mr. Tiberi, who is an influential member of the House Ways and Means Committee, would signal a deepening level of discontent among mainstream Republicans in Congress.

There’s a lot that goes into it, making sure each institution is ready to go.”  Companies have been racing to develop new forms of immunotherapy. The first cell-based cancer treatment — Kymriah, made by Novartis — was approved in August for children and young adults with an aggressive type of acute leukemia. It will cost $475,000, but the company has said it will not charge patients who do not respond within the first month after treatment. Novartis is expected to ask the F.D.A. to approve Kymriah for lymphoma and other blood cancers as well, and may vary its price depending on how well it works for those diseases.  Kite also plans to seek approval for other blood cancers, but does not plan to vary Yescarta’s price, said Ms. Cassiano.

Yet the United States cannot formally leave the accord until 2020, and in the interim administration officials have said they will continue to protect American interests, which essentially translates into helping to write the Paris agreement’s rule book. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R.

773,2191,10,19,2017,2017-10-19,The New York Times,China’s Reform Hopefuls Watch for Names. Only One May Matter.,"Still, when the party’s congress closes next week, world economic leaders may glean some clues about China’s direction depending on who is named to the Politburo Standing Committee, the seven-person group that makes its top decisions.  Should Mr. Wang be named to the committee, that could suggest a slightly greater emphasis over the next five years on economic reform, such as giving private enterprise more freedom or curbing dependence on state-directed lending.  But the party could send a different signal if it appoints Chen Min’er, the party boss of the less developed province of Guizhou. Mr. Chen’s development strategy there relied on building lots of tall bridges, a giant telescope and other government-led projects, as well as using official influence to help persuade large companies like Apple and Oracle to locate extensive data centers there.  One other possible new member, experts say, is Hu Chunhua, who succeeded Mr. Wang as Guangdong’s party boss. Mr. Hu has a much more cautious reputation on economic changes than does Mr. Wang, though he allowed many of Mr. Wang’s policies to continue. Outside of economics, Mr. Hu has taken a much tougher approach to dissent, crushing an experiment in democracy in a Guangdong village called Wukan that Mr. Wang had tolerated.  The last party congress, five years ago, offered a hint of China’s debt-fueled approach under Mr. Xi.  Joining him then on the standing committee was Zhang Gaoli, who ran the large metropolis of Tianjin. Mr. Zhang was best known for leading a government effort to build a “New Manhattan” — a forest of immense office towers and apartment buildings far from downtown Tianjin, erected in the hope of creating a new financial center. The vast satellite city has begun attracting some residents in recent years but has yet to turn into a financial hub.  By contrast, Mr. Wang was the mayor of an obscure town in south-central China, Tongling, when he wrote a pro-reform essay in 1991 for a local newspaper.

Both metrics are close to the levels the Fed regards as ideal. Indeed, it has seldom come closer. She also has presided over the gradual reduction of the Fed’s stimulus campaign, which was implemented in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, as the economy struggled through a bruising recession with persistent unemployment that peaked at 10 percent in October 2009.  Ms. Yellen’s calm and careful leadership style has won fans, both inside and outside of the Fed. John Williams, president of the San Francisco Fed, said that Ms. Yellen had been effective in building a consensus about the direction of policy among Fed officials, and in communicating policy to the markets and the public.  “When she came in there was a lot of concern about how would we unwind our policies and would that be disruptive and difficult, especially in the context of a global economy where other central banks were going in the other direction,” he said. “Now it’s almost like, ‘That was easy!’ But it wasn’t. It took hard work.”  Some of the other candidates, notably Mr. Taylor and Mr. Warsh, have argued the Fed should be raising interest rates more quickly. But financial regulation is the area in which a new chairman likely would make the largest changes. The Fed supervises the nation’s largest banks and oversees the broader financial system.  Mr. Trump wants to loosen financial regulations, which he regards as an impediment to economic growth. Ms. Yellen, who played a key role implementing the new banking rules after the 2008 crisis, has acknowledged room for improvement. But in a high-profile speech in August, she also issued a warning against going too far.  The Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, has argued that installing a new Fed chairman would help Mr. Trump achieve his goal of reducing regulation.  Charles W.

Even so, Democrats sounded the alarm, warning that the aspirational cuts in the budget plan called for slicing more than $1 trillion from Medicaid and about $470 billion from Medicare over a decade.  They also lamented the approach that Republicans are taking on taxes, which mirrors the strategy that they employed in their failed effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. On that matter, Republicans successfully laid the groundwork for a repeal measure that could pass without any Democratic votes, but party leaders could not ultimately get 50 Republican senators to agree on a health bill.  Though Democrats have pleaded to have more say in the tax overhaul, parliamentary language in the budget resolution would allow Republicans to pass a tax bill without any cooperation from the minority party. The tax measure could add as much as $1.5 trillion to budget deficits over a decade.  “Passing this budget is not a requirement for passing tax reform,” said Senator Gary Peters, Democrat of Michigan. “Passing this budget is only a requirement to pass a tax bill with as few votes as possible, without input or buy-in from members of the minority.”  For Republicans, the budget debate provided a moment to showcase their main goal in the coming months: Approving an overhaul of the tax code for the first time in decades, which they hope will lead to greater economic growth.  The House approved its budget resolution, which had long been stalled, on Oct. 5. The House budget also lays the groundwork for a tax bill, but, unlike the Senate’s approach, it calls for the legislation to not add to the deficit.  The House budget resolution also seeks more concrete action when it comes to cutting spending, instructing committees to come up with legislation that would produce at least about $200 billion in savings.  The chairwoman of the House Budget Committee, Representative Diane Black, Republican of Tennessee, had seemed reluctant to jettison that piece of the blueprint. “What part of ‘cut spending’ does @SenateGOP not understand?” she wrote on Twitter last week.

The researchers found that the attention deficits in all but five cases most likely stemmed from other causes, like marijuana use, depression or anxiety.  And the remaining five were hardly straightforward cases: One subject had previously had an eating disorder, another had shown signs of mania.  “This suggests to me the diagnosis doesn’t exist independent of a compelling psychiatric history,” said Dr. Sibley. “No one in our group developed A.D.H.D. in adulthood out of nowhere.”  Some 10 percent of children are given a diagnosis of A.D.H.D., and most grow out of it to some extent. One reason that symptoms may emerge seemingly from nowhere in high school or later, experts say, is that some youngsters have offsetting abilities, like high I.Q., or supports, such as sensitive parents or teachers, that mask the problems early on.  In this respect, upbringing and environment may effectively blunt or contain symptoms.  Not all experts believe the new report is the last word.  “When we take out all those people who have complicating problems, like substance use and mood disorders, we still find that about a third of late-onset cases remain,” said Jessica Agnew-Blais, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King’s College London.  She was co-author of a previous study that estimated the prevalence of adult-onset A.D.H.D. at about 6 percent. “What this discrepancy points to is that it’s important to look at different populations,” Dr. Agnew-Blais said of the new findings.  “I don’t think clinicians should be shutting the door, if the only sticking point is the age of onset of symptoms,” she added.",3.3125,24,"[4.0, 1.5, 5.0, 2.5, 2.5, 3.5, 2.0, 5.0, 2.5, 4.0, 1.0, 3.0, 3.0, 4.5, 5.0, 2.5, 3.0, 2.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5]"

She managed to survive the genocide by being bought and sold twice by the age of 13 — once to the Kurds, then by the Kurds to an Armenian family, which was my grandfather’s family. I have always felt a certain responsibility, as a bearer of DNA that was forged in the crucible of genocide, to the idea of universal human rights.  I went to Haiti after school and worked for three years with a peasant movement that was trying to build democracy. There was a remarkable effort by peasant organizations in the countryside, by unions in the cities, to mobilize a population that had never voted in a real election. I got to be a part of that process.  I learned Creole and came back to the States. Then a couple years later, my wife was working with farmworkers in Pennsylvania, and she got involved with some Haitian workers who were facing some pretty horrible conditions. They needed a translator, so I got involved. That was the first time I’d actually learned about what happened just beneath the surface of our food system. And it was pretty eye-opening.

816,2247,10,18,2017,2017-10-18,The New York Times,North Korea Is No Longer the Hermit Kingdom — but How Long Will China Be Its Lifeline?,"Until now, the calculus in Beijing has been guided by caution. Push North Korea too hard, the reasoning goes, and the resulting conflict or collapse could lead to millions of refugees pouring into China and a united, America-aligned Korea becoming entrenched on its doorstep. Now the balance may be shifting. Alarmed by Kim’s nuclear provocations — and perhaps pressured by the Trump administration — China is acting tougher on sanctions. In the past month, it has stopped trucks filled with North Korean seafood, ordered Chinese banks to drop North Korean clients and vowed to shut down North Korean companies. Some North Korean workers in northeast China are already heading home. As James Reilly, an associate professor at the University of Sydney, puts it, “China has really crossed the Rubicon.”  Yet there are serious doubts about how far China is willing to go. And because North Korean enterprises rarely leave their fingerprints on overseas bank accounts or companies, how tough can Beijing’s enforcement be? To skeptics, China’s late conversion signals not a commitment to sanctions but a desire not to be scapegoated by Washington, where the default position has long been that China is responsible for its wayward little brother. “China is not the only country that matters,” says Andrea Berger, a North Korea expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. “North Korea has a big footprint overseas, so we have to look at its networks around the world, too.”  North Korean trade outside China is deep and varied, its value often underestimated. Russia employs tens of thousands of North Korean workers in construction sites and Siberian logging camps even as it helps Pyongyang evade sanctions on oil imports. In Africa, where North Korea formed strong bonds during the independence struggles, the most visible signs are the massive statues built for leaders and dictators by North Korea’s state art studio, Mansudae. Behind these monuments is a bustling trade in arms, minerals and manpower, often aided by embassy staff. Only rarely are shipments stopped. Last year, though, Egyptian customs agents found 30,000 North Korean rocket-propelled grenades hidden under a mound of iron ore on a ship bound for their country, a United States ally. Since then, the Trump administration has withheld almost $300 million in aid and military funding from Egypt.  United Nations’ sanctions are now targeting one of the most lucrative enterprises: the export of quasi slave labor. An estimated 100,000 North Koreans are toiling around the world in abysmal conditions: 12-to-16-hour days under constant surveillance, their wages and freedom confiscated by the state. “North Korea is exporting crimes against humanity,” says Remco Breuker, a Dutch historian who led an investigation of companies using North Korean workers in Europe. These laborers can be found in roughly 40 countries, from shipyards in Poland to building sites in Qatar — to the little restaurant in my neighborhood.  When the disco lights at Pyongyang Okryu flashed on, our waitress appeared onstage in a lime green dress, crooning a North Korean melody. Two others danced beside her with little sense of rhythm or joy. Last year, 12 waitresses and a manager working in a restaurant in Ningbo, China, defected en masse, so the control over workers’ lives is reportedly even tighter now. Unlike my last visit to a North Korean restaurant, there were no homages to the leader, no conga lines to “Country Roads.” But near the end of the show, our waitress donned a traditional gown and played the 21-string gayageum, a kind of zither dating back to medieval times, when her Korean ancestors reigned over part of what is now China.

He added that the majority of workers in Elizabeth had either found new employment, decided to go back to school or retired.  But union representatives said most of the laid-off workers will never get work in the manufacturing industry again.  The average length of service among those at the plant was about 20 years, according to the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, and the average age of those affected by the closure was about 38.  But John Camillo, the union’s secretary in South Australia, said it was the workers over 50 that were particularly struggling to find new employment.  “It’s difficult out there, especially here in Adelaide,” Mr. Camillo said.  The decision to stop making cars in Australia reflects “the perfect storm of negative influences the car industry faces,” Mr. Turnbull said. He pointed to the continued strength of the Australian dollar, high production costs, and a small domestic market that is both competitive and fragmented.

Says It Will Reject Tax Returns That Lack Health Insurance Disclosure,"People may have also mistakenly believed they did not have to comply with the law’s reporting requirements. The new guidance suggests taxpayers will now face a sharp reminder that they need to provide this information, when they go to file a return electronically or submit the appropriate paperwork to get any refund they are due.  Under the law, an individual who does not have insurance can face a penalty of $695 a year for an individual, up to a maximum of $2,085 for a family or 2.5 percent of your adjusted gross income, whichever is higher. People are exempt from the penalty if they have too little income or if the lowest-priced coverage available costs them more than 8.16 percent of their household income.  The I.R.S. had initially held off rejecting returns because the law was new, but then it delayed its plans to assess the effect of the executive order, said Nicole M. Elliott, a tax lawyer for Holland & Knight and a former I.R.S. official involved in putting into effect the Affordable Care Act.  “It is curious, given the executive order,” Ms. Elliott said. “It’s a little unclear where the agencies are going and how heavy-handed they will be in enforcing it.”  In evaluating its stance, the agency may have decided the requirement eases the burden on taxpayers by making it clear they need not worry if they have insurance or are exempt from the penalty, she said.  But the I.R.S. may still decide not to actively enforce the mandate, Ms. Elliott added. While the agency is taking steps to be sure it collects all the information necessary to levy the penalty, it could also take a very lenient view of how aggressively it goes after anyone who does not sign up. “It’s dangerous to read too much into this,” she said.  The White House declined to comment.  The I.R.S.’s decision to actively prepare to enforce the mandate only adds to the uncertainty about where the president stands about the future of the law.

The Constitution grants her that right, but the Trump administration is determined to subvert it as part of its war on women’s reproductive rights.  Late Friday, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the teenager must be allowed to have an abortion, but it gave the federal government until Oct. 31 to find her a sponsor so that the government itself does not have to arrange for the procedure. The ruling came hours after the court heard the case, in which the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Refugee Resettlement said that if it released her to see a doctor it would “facilitate” an abortion, an action it said would contradict its interest in “promoting child birth and fetal life.” The government argued that barring an abortion doesn’t place an “undue burden” on her rights because she can always go home to get one — to a Central American country that criminalizes abortion and to parents who are abusive.  This argument is as weak as it is ideologically brazen.  It doesn’t seem to matter to the government that adult women in detention by law have access to abortion, or that this teenager has followed Texas law and obtained a waiver from a state court allowing her to get an abortion without her parents’ consent. And while the Office of Refugee Resettlement refuses to let employees at the shelter where she is being held take her to get an abortion, it ordered them to bring her to a “crisis pregnancy center” with the goal of talking her out of the procedure.  Friday’s ruling lets the government continue to shirk the law until it finds a sponsor. The American Civil Liberties Union was weighing an appeal, potentially to the Supreme Court. Not only the federal government is obstructing Jane Doe’s path; Texas lawmakers have created a hostile environment for reproductive rights. The Supreme Court last year struck down one of the harshest of those laws, but Texas still requires women seeking abortions to first undergo mandatory counseling and an ultrasound, both of which the teenager has done. And the state still bans almost all abortions after 20 weeks, leaving her with about a month before she passes the point at which she will be forced to give birth.",2.75,2,"[0.5, 5.0]"

I just knew that I wasn’t to open the door to anyone in uniform, and that there were certain bus stops our housekeeper, Juana, avoided.  But even with all the precautions, a man in a khaki shirt and sunglasses eventually knocked on our door, asked for Juana by name and carted her away. This happened a couple of times, but within weeks, she would be back at work.  This cat-and-mouse game was common in San Antonio back then, because once a Mexican immigrant hit town, he or she could find plenty of work as a nanny, a maid, a restaurant dishwasher, a landscaper, a road builder — as the cliché goes, pretty much everything that other people wouldn’t do, or wouldn’t do for the wages offered.  The pay was lower than minimum wage, and health benefits, if they existed at all, were subject to the whims of the workers’ “patrones.” Some, like my parents, went through the torturous, expensive process of making our housekeeper legal. Most Texans just figured they were paying better than in Mexico, and providing a foothold in the United States was enough.

Single individuals qualify for premium assistance if they earn $12,060 to $48,240, and they can buy any “metal” plan — bronze, silver, gold or platinum — on a state or federal exchange.  Here’s where the fix came in. Many states — more than 40 — allowed insurers to compensate for the loss of C.S.R.s by raising the rates of their silver plans. Because the value of the premium tax credits rises and falls with the price of a silver plan, consumers who qualify will not pay more than a set amount of their income. Instead, the federal government picks up the tab of the rising costs.  In other words, insurers are allowed to claim subsidies, but through a different, more lucrative channel. It will also, not coincidentally, cost the government more than if it had simply paid the subsidies in the first place, because of the cost of covering higher premium rates for consumers who, by law, receive subsidies.

An Industry Insider Helps Call the Shots,"It is a cause with far-reaching consequences for consumers and chemical companies, as the E.P.A. regulates some 80,000 different chemicals, many of them highly toxic and used in workplaces, homes and everyday products. If chemicals are deemed less risky, they are less likely to be subjected to heavy oversight and restrictions.  The effort is not new, nor is the decades-long debate over how best to identify and assess risks, but the industry has not benefited from such highly placed champions in government since the Reagan administration. The cause was taken up by Dr. Beck and others in the administration of President George W. Bush, with some success, and met with resistance during the Obama administration. Now it has been aggressively revived under President Trump by an array of industry-backed political appointees and others.  Dr. Beck, who has a doctorate in environmental health, comes from a camp — firmly backed by the chemical industry — that says the government too often directs burdensome rules at what she has called “phantom risks.”  Other scientists and administrators at the E.P.A., including Wendy Cleland-Hamnett, until last month the agency’s top official overseeing pesticides and toxic chemicals, say the dangers are real and the pushback is often a tactic for deflecting accountability — and shoring up industry profits at the expense of public safety.  Since Mr. Trump’s election, Dr. Beck’s approach has been unabashedly ascendant, according to interviews with more than two dozen current and former E.P.A. and White House officials, confidential E.P.A. documents, and materials obtained through open-record requests.  In March, Scott Pruitt, the E.P.A. chief, overrode the recommendation of Ms. Hamnett and agency scientists to ban the commercial use of the pesticide chlorpyrifos, blamed for developmental disabilities in children.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The E.P.A.’s new leadership also pressed agency scientists to re-evaluate a plan to ban certain uses of two dangerous chemicals that have caused dozens of deaths or severe health problems: methylene chloride, which is found in paint strippers, and trichloroethylene, which removes grease from metals and is used in dry cleaning.  “It was extremely disturbing to me,” Ms. Hamnett said of the order she received to reverse the proposed pesticide ban. “The industry met with E.P.A. political appointees. And then I was asked to change the agency’s stand.”  The E.P.A. and Dr. Beck declined repeated requests to comment that included detailed lists of questions.  “No matter how much information we give you, you would never write a fair piece,” Liz Bowman, a spokeswoman for the E.P.A., said in an email. “The only thing inappropriate and biased is your continued fixation on writing elitist clickbait trying to attack qualified professionals committed to serving their country.”  Before joining the E.P.A., Ms. Bowman was a spokeswoman for the American Chemistry Council.  The conflict over how to define risk in federal regulations comes just as the E.P.A. was supposed to be fixing its backlogged and beleaguered chemical regulation program. Last year, after a decade of delays, Congress passed bipartisan legislation that would push the E.P.A. to determine whether dozens of chemicals were so dangerous that they should be banned or restricted.  The E.P.A.’s Top 10 Toxic Threats, and Industry’s Pushback  The chemical safety law was passed after Congress and the chemical industry reached a consensus that toxic chemical threats — or at least the fear of them — were so severe that they undermined consumer confidence in products on the market.  But now the chemical industry and many of the companies that use their compounds are praising the Trump administration’s changed direction, saying new chemicals are getting faster regulatory reviews and existing chemicals will benefit from a less dogmatic approach to determining risk.  “U.S. businesses, jobs and competitiveness depend on a functioning new chemicals program,” Calvin M. Dooley, a former congressman who is president of the American Chemistry Council, said in a statement. It was issued in June after Dr. Beck, his recent employee, pushed through many industry-friendly changes in her new role at the E.P.A., including the change in tracking legacy chemicals such as PFOA.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Anne Womack Kolton, a vice president at the council, said on Wednesday that Dr. Beck’s appointment was a positive development.  “We, along with many others, are glad that individuals who support credible science and thorough analysis as the basis for policymaking have agreed to serve,” she said in an email. “Consistency, transparency and high quality science in the regulatory process are in everyone’s interests.”  The Trump administration’s shift, the industry has acknowledged, could have financial benefits. Otherwise, the industry may lose “millions of dollars and years of research invested in a chemical,” the American Chemistry Council and other groups wrote in a legal brief defending the changes Dr. Beck had engineered.  But consumer advocates and many longtime scientists, managers and administrators at the E.P.A. are alarmed by the administration’s priorities and worry that the new law’s anticipated crackdown on hazardous chemicals could be compromised.  “You are never going to have 100 percent certainty on anything,” Ms. Hamnett said. “But when you have a chemical that evidence points to is causing fatalities, you err more on the side of taking some action, as opposed to ‘Let’s wait and spend some more time and try to get the science entirely certain,’ which it hardly ever gets to be.”  The divergent approaches and yearslong face-off between Ms. Hamnett and Dr. Beck parallel the story of the chemical industry’s quest to keep the E.P.A.’s enforcement arm at bay.  The two women, one a lawyer from New Jersey, the other a scientist from Long Island, have dedicated their lives to the issue of hazardous chemicals. Each’s expertise is respected by her peers, but their perspectives couldn’t be more dissimilar.  Ms. Hamnett, 63, spent her entire 38-year career at the E.P.A., joining the agency directly from law school as a believer in consumer and environmental protections. Dr. Beck, 51, did a fellowship at the E.P.A., but has spent most of her 29-year career elsewhere: in a testing lab at Estée Lauder, as a toxicologist in the Washington State Health Department, as a regulatory analyst in the White House and most recently with the chemical industry’s trade group.  Photo  Before Mr. Trump’s election, Ms. Hamnett would have been regarded as the hands-down victor in their professional tug of war. Her decision to retire in September amounted to a surrender of sorts, a powerful acknowledgment of the two women’s reversed fortunes under the Trump administration.

Her farewell party in late August was held in the wood-paneled Map Room on the first floor of the E.P.A. headquarters, the same room where Mr. Trump had signed an executive order backed by big business that called for the agency to dismantle environmental protections.  Dr. Beck was among those who spoke. She thanked Ms. Hamnett for her decades of service. “I don’t know what I am going to do without her,” she said, according to multiple people who attended the event.  Ms. Hamnett, in an interview, said she had little trouble envisioning the future under the new leadership. “It’s time for me to go,” she said. “I have done what I could do.”  ‘Unreasonable Risk of Injury’  Chemical regulation was not part of the E.P.A.’s original mission. But several environmental disasters in the early 1970s prompted Congress to extend the agency’s authority.  Industrial waste, including highly toxic PCBs, led to fish kills in the Hudson River. Chemicals from flame retardants were detected in livestock in Michigan, contaminating food across the state. And residents in Niagara Falls, N.Y., first started to notice a black, oily liquid in their basements, early hints of one of the worst environmental disasters in United States history: Love Canal.  President Gerald R. Ford signed the Toxic Substances Control Act in October 1976, giving the E.P.A. the authority to ban or restrict chemicals it deemed dangerous. It was hailed as a public health breakthrough.  “For the first time, the law empowers the federal government to control and even to stop production or use of chemical substances that may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or environment,” a federal report said.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  A few years later, after graduating from George Washington University Law School in 1979, Ms. Hamnett landed at the E.P.A. She arrived fully embracing its enhanced mission.  She had grown up in Trenton, where the words “Trenton Makes, the World Takes” are affixed in neon to the side of a railroad bridge spanning the Delaware River.  Photo  Her childhood memories included passing by the 200-acre Roebling Steel Company plant — named after the designer of the Brooklyn Bridge. At its peak, the plant was Trenton’s largest employer, and it helped spread prosperity to the region.  But the company was also a chronic polluter. For decades, it dumped arsenic, chromium, lead and other hazardous chemicals, contaminating soil and groundwater. Ultimately, the pollution was so pervasive that the E.P.A. declared the property a Superfund cleanup site.  It was this legacy, as well as the congressional directive to the E.P.A. to protect the public from harm, that Ms. Hamnett said guided her.  During the Bush administration, she was drawn into a contentious debate involving lead paint that highlighted her resolve — and that of her opponents.  Few environmental hazards are as well understood as the dangers of lead in paint. Since it was first used in homes in the United States, more than a century ago, it has poisoned children. Even after it was banned in the late 1970s, it remained a threat, particularly when renovations took place in the tens of millions of homes with lead-based paint.  The E.P.A. set out to establish standards governing home renovations, and Ms. Hamnett came to the discussions with a strong perspective.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “What is the effect of exposure likely to be?” she recalled asking. “If it is likely to be a severe effect and result in a significant number of people exposed, if so, I am going to err on the side of safety.”  While the evidence was solid that lead caused learning disabilities and other problems for children, it was less definitive on whether it was also a factor in adult diseases.  To Ms. Hamnett and her colleagues, the results of multiple studies were compelling enough to establish an apparent link to cardiovascular disease in adults. They concluded in a report in 2006 that there was “stronger evidence for a relationship between lead exposure and blood pressure for adults,” citing it as a factor for aggressive safety requirements.  The home renovation industry filed protests over the “inappropriate and costly” rule with the Bush administration and Congress. Taking up its cause was a White House official with a reputation for assessing risk much differently: Dr. Beck.  Throwing ‘Sand in the Gears’  As the Bush administration took office, John D. Graham, who ran the White House office overseeing regulations, unveiled a plan to ease the government’s burden on business by reining in “the regulatory state.”  To that end, Mr. Graham hired scientists to review major federal regulations and make recommendations about their worthiness, something the E.P.A. itself had done over the years.  Dr. Beck, Mr. Graham said, was an excellent addition to his staff.  She had grown up in Oyster Bay, N.Y., an affluent suburb on Long Island, earned an undergraduate microbiology degree in 1988 from Cornell and a doctorate from the University of Washington a decade later. Her dissertation, which examined how the sedative phenobarbital impacts the metabolism of the liver, started with words still relevant to her today: “Each day the human body is confronted with many potentially toxic substances in the form of food items, medicinal products and environmental agents.”  She started her career at Estée Lauder, where she helped develop preservatives used to extend the shelf life of cosmetics, and also designed laboratory tests to determine if products caused adverse reactions when applied to skin.  When Mr. Graham hired her, she had been working as a science fellow at the E.P.A.’s center for environmental reviews. He described her as having “street smarts and thick skin,” someone who did not need the limelight to be effective.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “Dr. Beck is easy to underestimate,” Mr. Graham said in an email.  When the proposed lead paint rule came along in 2006, Dr. Beck, in her White House role, pressed Ms. Hamnett and others in the E.P.A. to revise the language to diminish the link to cardiovascular disease in adults, Ms. Hamnett recalled, before letting the rule go into effect.  That was one marker in Dr. Beck’s journey to redefine the way the government evaluates risk. Though they repeatedly found themselves on opposite sides, Ms. Hamnett said that, in a way, she admired Dr. Beck’s effort during those years.  She described Dr. Beck as a voracious reader of scientific studies and agency reports, diving deep into footnotes and scientific data with a rigor matched by few colleagues. She combed through thousands of comments submitted on proposed rules. And she had a habit of reading the Federal Register, the daily diary of new federal rules.  All of it made Dr. Beck an intimidating and confident adversary, Ms. Hamnett recalled. “She’s very smart and very well informed,” she said.  But there was a destructive side to that confidence, others said. In particular, Dr. Beck was seen as an enemy of scientists and risk assessors at the E.P.A., willing to challenge the validity of their studies and impose her own judgment, said Robert M. Sussman, a lawyer who represented chemical industry clients during the Bush administration and later became an E.P.A. lawyer and policy adviser under the Obama administration.  “Her goal was to throw sand in the gears to stop things from going forward,” said Mr. Sussman, who now is counsel to Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families, a coalition of consumer and environmental groups.  Jack Housenger, a biologist who served as the director of the E.P.A.’s pesticide program, had a more positive recollection. He said Dr. Beck asked reasonable questions about his findings related to a wood preservative used in playgrounds and outdoor decks that was being pulled from the market.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “She wanted us to present the uncertainties and ranges of risk,” said Mr. Housenger, who retired this year. “She was trying to understand the methodology.”  Paul Noe, a lawyer who worked with Dr. Beck during the Bush administration, also said her critics got her wrong.  “What you really want to do as a government is to set priorities,” he said. “If you don’t have a realistic way of distinguishing significant risks from insignificant ones, you are just going to get bogged down and waste significant resources, and that can impede public health and safety.”  One of the harshest criticisms of Dr. Beck’s tenure in the Bush White House came in 2007 from the nonpartisan National Academy of Sciences, which examined a draft policy she helped write proposing much stricter controls over the way the government evaluates risks.  “The committee agrees that there is room for improvement in risk assessment practices in the federal government,” the review said, but it described Dr. Beck’s suggestions as “oversimplified” and “fundamentally flawed.” It recommended her proposal be withdrawn.  Dr. Beck was so aggressive in second-guessing E.P.A. scientists that she became central to a special investigation by the House Committee on Science and Technology.  The committee obtained copies of her detailed emails to agency officials and accused her of slowing progress in confirming drinking-water health threats presented by chemicals like perchlorate, used in rocket fuel. “Suppression of Environmental Science by the Bush Administration’s Office of Management and Budget,” the committee wrote in 2009, before describing Dr. Beck’s actions.  The opposition became so intense that Dr. Beck’s efforts started to get shut down.  First, the new risk assessment policy she had proposed was formally withdrawn. Then, after Mr. Obama took office in 2009, Mr. Sussman recalled going to the White House along with Lisa P. Jackson, the new E.P.A. administrator, to ask for a commitment to curb Dr. Beck’s power.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “We told them that we need the White House out of the E.P.A. science program,” Mr. Sussman said. “We demanded that. And we got it.”  Continuing the Fight  During Mr. Obama’s first term, Dr. Beck left the White House for the American Chemistry Council, whose members include Dow, DuPont and dozens of other major manufacturers and chemical companies.  As the trade association’s senior regulatory scientist, she was perfectly positioned to continue her second-guessing of the E.P.A.’s science.  Now her detailed criticisms of the agency came on trade association letterhead and in presentations at agency meetings and events.  “If the same person says the same thing three times, does this create a weight of evidence?” Dr. Beck said in a presentation in 2013, essentially mocking the scientific standards at the agency.

E.P.A. records show her challenging the agency’s scientific conclusions related to arsenic (used to manufacture semiconductors), tert-Butanol (used in perfumes and as an octane booster in gasoline), and 1-bromopropane (used in dry cleaning).  Her point was often the same: Did the scientists producing work that federal regulators relied on adequately justify all of the conclusions about any risks?  “Scientists today are more prolific than ever,” she said in a November 2014 presentation, later adding that “unfortunately, many of the scientific studies we read about in the news were not quite ready for prime time.”  But at the same time, the industry was confronting a much larger existential problem.  E.P.A. and government-funded academic researchers were raising serious health questions about the safety of a range of chemicals, including flame retardants in furniture and plastics in water bottles and children’s toys. Consumer confidence in the industry was eroding.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Some state legislatures, frustrated by the E.P.A.’s slow response and facing a consumer backlash, moved to increase their own authority to investigate and act on the problems — threatening the chemical industry with an unwieldy patchwork of state rules and regulations.  Dr. Beck and other chemical industry representatives were dispatched to the E.P.A. and Congress to press for changes to the federal regulatory system that would standardize testing of the most worrisome existing chemicals and improve and accelerate the evaluation of new ones.  The resulting law, passed last year with Democratic and Republican support, gave both sides something they wanted. The chemical industry got pre-emption from most new state regulations, and environmentalists got assurances that new chemicals would be evaluated on health and safety risks alone, not financial considerations.  It was the most significant overhaul of the Toxic Substances Control Act since its enactment in the 1970s, and once again Ms. Hamnett was prepared to help shepherd it into place. The task was shaping up to be what she considered her final, crowning act at the E.P.A.  Ms. Hamnett was invited to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, a part of the White House complex, to be present as Mr. Obama signed the bill into law. She was so excited that she arrived early and sneaked up to the stage to look at the papers Mr. Obama would be signing.  Photo  “Protecting people and the environment for decades to come,” she said, recalling her thoughts, as she excitedly stood on the stage. “At least, that is what we planned.”  Turning the Tables  They gathered in early June around a long conference table at the E.P.A. headquarters, the sunlight shining in from Constitution Avenue. In the crowd were Dr. Beck, Ms. Hamnett and other top agency officials charged with regulating toxic chemicals, as well as environmentalists worried about last-minute changes to rules being pushed by the chemical industry.  Olga Naidenko, an immunologist specializing in children’s health, said she was struck by the head-spinning scene. Dr. Beck, who had spent years trying to influence Ms. Hamnett and others to issue rules friendly to the chemical industry, was now sitting at the conference table as a government decision maker.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “I am running the show. I am now in the chair. And it is mine,” Dr. Naidenko said, describing her impressions of Dr. Beck at the gathering.  The Obama-era leadership at the E.P.A., in its last weeks, had published drafts of two critical rules needed to start the new chemical program. The rules detailed how the agency would choose the most risky chemicals to be tested or evaluated and how the hazards should be judged.  It would be up to Mr. Pruitt, the new E.P.A. chief, and his team to complete the process in time for a June deadline, set in the legislation.  Dr. Naidenko, a staff scientist at the Environmental Working Group, was there to plead with the agency to ignore a request from the American Chemistry Council to make more than a dozen last-minute changes, some pushed by Dr. Beck while she was at the council.  Dr. Beck did not seem convinced, recalled Dr. Naidenko and one of her colleagues, Melanie Benesh, a lawyer with the same organization.  “Tell me why you are concerned. What is it about?” Ms. Benesh and Ms. Hamnett each said they recalled Dr. Beck saying.  In fact, behind the scenes, the deed was already done.  Before Dr. Beck’s arrival, representatives from the E.P.A.’s major divisions had agreed on final wording for the rules that would be sent to the White House for approval. But they were told to wait until May 1, when Dr. Beck began her job as the acting assistant administrator for chemical safety.  Dr. Beck then spent her first weeks on the job pressing agency staff to rewrite the standards to reflect, in some cases, word for word, the chemical industry’s proposed changes, three staff members involved in the effort said. They asked not to be named for fear of losing their jobs.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Dr. Beck had unusual authority to make it happen.  When she was hired by the Trump administration, she was granted the status of “administratively determined” position. It is an unusual classification that means she was not hired based on a competitive process — as civil servants are — and she was also not identified as a political appointee. There are only about a dozen such posts at the E.P.A., among the 15,800 agency employees, and the jobs are typically reserved for technical experts, not managers with the authority to give orders.  Crucially, the special status meant that Dr. Beck did not have to abide by the ethics agreement Mr. Trump adopted in January, which bars political appointees in his administration from participating for two years “in any particular matter involving specific parties that is directly and substantially related to my former employer or former clients, including regulations and contracts.”  Her written offer of employment, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, also made it clear that Dr. Beck’s appointment was junior enough not to require Senate confirmation, which would have almost certainly delayed her arrival at the agency and prevented her from making changes to the rules ahead of the June deadline.  None of these arrangements raised concerns with the E.P.A.’s acting general counsel, Kevin S. Minoli, who issued a ruling on her unusual employment status. Mr. Minoli saw Dr. Beck’s background as a benefit, according to a memo he wrote that was reviewed by The Times.  “You have extensive prior experience with the regulated industry’s perspective and are already familiar with (and may well have authored) A.C.C. comments now under consideration,” he wrote, referring to the American Chemistry Council.  He added that Dr. Beck’s “unique expertise, knowledge and prior experience will ensure that the agency is able to consider all perspectives, including that of the regulated industry’s major trade association.”  Photo  Others at the E.P.A., however, were stunned at the free pass given to Dr. Beck.  “It was a clear demonstration this administration has been captured by the industry,” said Elizabeth Southerland, who served as the director of science and technology in the Office of Water until her retirement in July.  Getting Her Way  In the weeks leading up to the June deadline, Dr. Beck made clear what changes she wanted.  The conversations were polite, and Dr. Beck listened to counterarguments that Ms. Hamnett and her team made, Ms. Hamnett said. But in most cases, Dr. Beck did not back down, demanding a variety of revisions, particularly related to how the agency defined risks.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  It all had a familiar ring. Ms. Hamnett and the others had fielded many of the same demands from the American Chemistry Council and from Dr. Beck herself when she worked there. Ms. Hamnett took detailed notes in spiral notepads, excerpts from which she showed The Times.  One area of contention was Dr. Beck’s insistence that the E.P.A. adopt precise definitions of terms and phrases used in imposing rules and regulations, such as “best available science” and “weight of the evidence.”  The agency had repeatedly rejected the idea, most recently in January, in part because the definitions were seen as a guise for opponents to raise legal challenges.  “These terms have and will continue to evolve with changing scientific methods and innovation,” the agency said in a Jan. 17 statement in the Federal Register, three days before Mr. Trump was sworn in. “Codifying specific definitions for these phrases in this rule may inhibit the flexibility and responsiveness of the agency to quickly adapt to and implement changing science.”  Another area of dispute involved the “all uses” standard for evaluating health threats posed by chemicals. Under that standard, the E.P.A. would consider any possible use of a chemical when determining how to regulate it; Dr. Beck, like the chemical industry, wanted the E.P.A. to limit the evaluations to specific intended uses.  “There is no way we can look at thousands of uses,” Dr. Beck told Ms. Hamnett in one meeting in mid-May, according to Ms. Hamnett and her notes. “We can’t chase the last molecule.”  Photo  As the June deadline under the new law approached, Dr. Beck took control of the rewriting herself, a highly unusual step at the E.P.A., where expert Civil Service employees traditionally hold the rule-writing pen.  Ms. Hamnett said she did not try to stop Dr. Beck given she had the support of the agency’s new leadership.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Mr. Noe, the lawyer who worked with Dr. Beck during the Bush administration, was not involved in the rewriting of the new rules. But he said it was wrong to interpret Dr. Beck’s actions as pro-industry; instead, he said, she was a defender of rigorous science.  “Anyone who would question Nancy’s ability or integrity does not know her at all and just has a political ax to grind,” he said.  Ms. Hamnett’s handwritten notes, however, record increasingly urgent objections from across the agency, including from the Waste and Chemical Enforcement Division, the Office of Water and the Office of General Counsel.  “Everyone was furious,” said Ms. Southerland, the official from the Office of Water. “Nancy was just rewriting the rule herself. And it was a huge change. Everybody was stunned such a substantial change would be made literally in the last week.”  The general counsel’s objections to the substance of the changes were among the most alarming.  Laurel Celeste, an agency lawyer, questioned whether the last-minute changes would leave the agency’s rule-making open to legal challenges. Her objections were outlined in a memo reviewed by The Times that was marked “confidential attorney client communication. Do not release under FOIA,” referring to the Freedom of Information Act.  Federal law requires rules to be a “logical outgrowth” of the administrative record. But Dr. Beck had demanded changes that the staff had rejected, meaning that the rule contained items that “differ so greatly from the proposal that they cannot be considered to be the ‘logical outgrowth’ of the proposal and the comments,” Ms. Celeste said.  Her memo, sent by email on May 30 to Dr. Beck and more than two dozen agency scientists and staff members, also raised concerns about the preamble, an important piece of any regulation that must accurately reflect its contents.  “We are also concerned that, as currently drafted, the preamble lacks an adequate rationale for a number of final rule provisions that have changed significantly from the proposal,” Ms. Celeste wrote.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The objections were strongly worded, but they fell short of an important legal threshold — the formal filing of a “nonconcurrence” memo — that would have triggered further review of Dr. Beck’s actions. Several E.P.A. staff members said in interviews that they had been told by Mr. Pruitt’s top deputies to air their concerns in so-called concur-with-comment memos, which put objections on the record but allowed the process to move forward.  The rules, with Dr. Beck’s changes, were sent to the White House and approved by the June deadline. Mr. Pruitt assembled the team in late June for a brief ceremony to celebrate the completion of the work.  “Everybody here worked very, very hard,” Ms. Hamnett said, as Mr. Pruitt signed his name, according to a video of the ceremony posted by the E.P.A.  Photo  ‘Not One of My Best Days’  Environmentalists were dismayed, but Ms. Hamnett emerged from the whirlwind process with some confidence that all was not lost.  While she disagreed with a number of Dr. Beck’s changes, she trusted that the E.P.A. staff would maintain its commitment to honor Congress’s intent in the 2016 legislation. That would translate into a rigorous crackdown on the most dangerous chemicals, regardless of the changes.  But her confidence in the E.P.A.’s resolve was fragile, and it had been shaken by other actions, including the order Ms. Hamnett received to reverse course on banning the pesticide chlorpyrifos.  The order came before Dr. Beck’s arrival at the agency, but Ms. Hamnett saw the industry’s fingerprints all over it. Mr. Pruitt’s chief of staff, Ryan Jackson, instructed Ms. Hamnett to ignore the recommendation of agency scientists, she said.  The scientists had called for a ban based on research suggesting the pesticide might cause developmental disabilities in children.  Photo  To keep the pesticide on the market, under E.P.A. guidelines, the agency needed to have a “reasonable certainty” that no harm was being caused.  “The science and the law tell us this is the way to go,” Ms. Hamnett said of a ban.  But the reaction from her superiors was not about the science or the law, she said. Instead, they queried her about Dow Chemical, the pesticide’s largest manufacturer, which had been lobbying against a ban.  The clash is recorded in Ms. Hamnett notebook as well as in emails among Mr. Pruitt’s top political aides, which were obtained by The Times.  “They are trying to strong arm us,” Mr. Jackson wrote after meeting with Ms. Hamnett, who presented him with a draft petition to ban the pesticide.  Mr. Jackson, Ms. Hamnett’s notebook shows, then asked her to come up with alternatives to a ban. He asserted, her notes show, that he did not want to be “forced into a box” by the petition.  Photo  “I scared them,” Mr. Jackson wrote in an email to a colleague about his demands on Ms. Hamnett and her team.  As a possible compromise, Ms. Hamnett’s team had been talking to Dow about perhaps phasing out the pesticide instead of imposing an immediate ban. But Dow, after Mr. Trump’s election, was suddenly in no mood to compromise, Ms. Hamnett recalled. Dow did not respond to requests for comment.  She now knew, she said, that the effort to ban the pesticide had been lost, something Mr. Jackson’s emails celebrated.  “They know where this is headed,” Mr. Jackson wrote.  Just over a week later, Ms. Hamnett submitted a draft order that would deny the request for a ban.  “It was hard, very hard,” she said, worrying that the pesticide would continue to harm children of farmworkers. “That was not one of my best days.”  The episode is one reason she worries the E.P.A. will defer to the chemical industry as it begins to evaluate toxic chemicals under the standards created by the new law. She became particularly concerned because of a more recent exchange with Dr. Beck over methylene chloride, which is used in paint removers.  After more than a decade of research, the agency had concluded in January that methylene chloride was so hazardous that its use in paint removers should be banned.  Methylene chloride has been blamed in dozens of deaths, including that of a 21-year-old Tennessee man in April, who was overwhelmed by fumes as he was refinishing a bathtub.  “How is it possible that you can go to a home improvement store and buy a paint remover that can kill you?” Ms. Hamnett asked. “How can we let this happen?”  Furniture-refinishing companies and chemical manufacturers have urged the E.P.A. to focus on steps like strengthening warning labels, complaining that there are few reasonably priced alternatives.  Ms. Hamnett said Dr. Beck raised the possibility that people were not following the directions on the labels. She also suggested that only a small number of users had been injured. “Is it 1 percent?” Ms. Hamnett recalled Dr. Beck asking.  Ms. Hamnett said she was devastated by the line of questioning.  After years of successfully fending off Dr. Beck and her industry allies, the balance of power at the agency had shifted toward the industry.  Photo  She had long planned to wrap up her work at the agency soon, as her husband, David, had retired three years ago. On Sept. 1, Ms. Hamnett turned in her badge and joined him.  Mr. Pruitt has selected a replacement for Ms. Hamnett: Michael L. Dourson, a toxicologist who has spent the last two decades as a consultant helping businesses fight E.P.A. restrictions on the use of potentially toxic compounds. He is already at work at the agency in a temporary post while he awaits Senate confirmation.  The American Chemistry Council, and its members, are among the top private-sector sponsors of Mr. Dourson’s research. Last year, he collaborated on a paper that was funded by the trade group.

So far, Americans seem to accept that these missions and the deployments they require will continue indefinitely. Still, it’s a very real question whether, in addition to endorsing these commitments, which have cost trillions of dollars and many lives over 16 years, they will embrace new entanglements of the sort President Trump has seemed to portend with his rash threats and questionable decisions on North Korea and Iran.  For that reason alone, it’s time to take stock of how broadly American forces are already committed to far-flung regions and to begin thinking hard about how much of that investment is necessary, how long it should continue and whether there is a strategy beyond just killing terrorists. Which Congress, lamentably, has not done. If the public is quiet, that is partly because so few families bear so much of this military burden, and partly because America is not involved in anything comparable to the Vietnam War, when huge American casualties produced sustained public protest. It is also because Congress has spent little time considering such issues in a comprehensive way or debating why all these deployments are needed.  Congress has repeatedly ducked efforts by Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, and others to put the war against the Islamic State, which has broad popular support but no specific congressional authorization, on a firm legal footing. President Trump, like his predecessor, insists that legislation passed in 2001 to authorize the war against Al Qaeda is sufficient. It isn’t. After the Niger tragedy, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Corker of Tennessee, has agreed to at least hold a hearing on the authorization issue. It is scheduled for Oct. 30.  Andrew Bacevich, a retired Army colonel who lost a son in Iraq and is a critic of military operations, says that “a collective indifference to war has become an emblem of contemporary America.” The idea that Americans could be inured to war and all its horrors is chilling, and it’s a recipe for dangerous decisions with far-reaching ramifications. There are many factors contributing to this trend:  During earlier wars, including Vietnam, the draft put most families at risk of having a loved one go to war, but now America has all-volunteer armed forces. Less than 1 percent of the population now serves in the military, compared with more than 12 percent in World War II.

Though the allotted time for the grilling had expired, he offered to stick around as long as they wanted.  But Representative Trey Gowdy, who spent nearly three years investigating Hillary Clinton’s culpability in the deadly 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya, was growing frustrated after two hours.

It Didn’t Work So Well for F.D.R.,"“His goal was two responsible, unified parties to replace, as he said, ‘Tweedledum and Tweedledee’ parties,” said Susan Dunn, a Williams College historian and author of “Roosevelt’s Purge,” the definitive book on the 1938 election. “To me, Trump’s purge is only about vindictiveness. He wants to strike out at and defeat the people who have dared to criticize him.”  Other presidents have been incensed by wayward members of their parties, but few attempted what Roosevelt did and what Mr. Trump is threatening. Karl Rove, deputy chief of staff to President George W. Bush, at times grew livid at Republicans who defied the White House. But he said the idea of challenging them in primaries was anathema.  Roosevelt’s experience showed the dangers of isolation in the White House, said Mr. Rove, who has sharply criticized Mr. Bannon’s efforts. “The lesson is it’s better to try to influence by encouragement than by opposition,” he said. “It’s important to keep focused on the main things people want you to keep focused on — what are the big issues of the day? And don’t let your personal pique guide your political actions.” (Mr. Bannon said he would not reply because it would be “punching down.”)  Unlike Mr. Trump, with his historically low poll ratings, Roosevelt was broadly popular at the time. He swept to re-election in 1936 with 61 percent of the vote, winning all but two states in one of the biggest landslides in American history, and his approval ratings remained high. While Mr. Trump’s Republicans can afford to lose only two votes in the Senate, Roosevelt’s Democrats enjoyed large majorities in Congress.  But Roosevelt grew angry at resistance from Democrats to additional domestic programs and repeated Supreme Court rulings overturning parts of the New Deal. The confrontation came to a head when he sought to pack the Supreme Court by adding as many as six more justices to seize control of the bench, an idea that provoked fierce opposition in both parties and ultimately collapsed.  Harry Hopkins, Roosevelt’s confidant, railed against Democrats “who tricked the voters by wearing our insignia only to turn against us as soon as they got in office.” Roosevelt was so angry that his “resentment crystallized into the desire to crush all who conspired against the throne,” said George Creel, a journalist and critic at the time. So Roosevelt put together a team to organize a campaign against the conservative Democrats. The newspapers called it the “elimination committee” and labeled the campaign Roosevelt’s “purge,” a reference to Stalin’s terror in the Soviet Union.",2.6666666666666665,3,"[1.5, 5.0, 1.5]"

Consumers who have been trapped in debt by the notorious payday lending industry will now get extra help from the bureau with a rule imposed this month.  These lenders advertise as “easy” the short-term loans that come due in two weeks. The borrower typically writes a postdated check for the full balance — including fees — or allows the lender to electronically debit funds from his or her checking account. The borrowers often take out another loan to pay off the first, falling to a cycle of increasing debt.  The bureau found in a 2014 study of about 12 million payday loans that only 15 percent of borrowers could repay the total debt without borrowing again within two weeks. Nearly two-thirds of borrowers renewed the loans — some more than 10 times — paying heavy fees that further eroded their financial standing. Strikingly, the bureau found that most people pay more in fees than they originally borrowed.  The new rule limits how often and how much customers can borrower. And lenders must take the common-sense underwriting approach, determining whether the borrower can pay the total loan and still meet living expenses.",3.5,2,"[3.5, 3.5]"

Whatever one thinks of this technology, the public debate about the issue and the vote by the board, a five-member civilian oversight group, was refreshing — but all too rare. Americans deserve transparency and detailed information about the surveillance tools the police are using or considering, and they’re often denied it.  That’s because there’s intense resistance to offering this information. For instance, a New York City Council bill introduced in March, would require the New York Police Department to disclose any surveillance technology it uses and to make public the policies about restrictions on the use of this technology. But Mayor Bill de Blasio said the bill “provides a road map for the bad guys,” potentially aiding criminals or even terrorists by making them privy to information about law enforcement tactics.  This concern is misplaced. The real risk is that without this type of legislation, the good guys — everyday citizens — will be left in the dark. Police departments should be doing more, not less, to keep the public informed about what tactics they’re using and why.  This is a nationwide issue. That’s why, last year, the American Civil Liberties Union began the Community Control Over Police Surveillance legislative effort, seeking to increase surveillance transparency and allow for input from the communities in cities across the country.

Dr. Gottlieb said some companies had gotten down to a 24-hour supply of diesel fuel, and representatives for the medical-device industry had said some generators were beginning to break down, requiring emergency repair.  Pharmacists at half a dozen hospitals, from Utah to North Carolina, said in interviews that the fluid bag shortage had had a domino effect, leading to scarcities of a range of products as administrators race to stock up on the supplies they need to keep their hospitals running smoothly. Even products like empty bags and plastic tubing, which are also made by Baxter in Puerto Rico, have been hard to come by, some said.  “With drug shortages, it is often a race to see who can find a supply of the drug on shortage and also any alternatives,” said Philip J. Trapskin, who is the program manager of medication use strategy and innovation at UW Health, the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s health system. “We have been able to get what we need to avoid disruptions in patient care, but the mix of products is not ideal and there are no guarantees we will continue to get the supplies we need.”  Baxter recently announced that the F.D.A. had allowed it to import bags from the company’s factories in Ireland and Australia, and said production in Puerto Rico was slowly resuming. The company, which is based in Deerfield, Ill., said it was also helping its employees on the island, including distributing generators and propane-powered cooktops for the workers’ use. “While the storm devastated the island in a day, the recovery will take time,” the company said in a statement.  Baxter did not provide a timeline for when the bags would be back in stock, and pharmacists said they anticipated that the bags might not be available for many more weeks or months. “This is a big deal for hospitals across the country,” said Scott Knoer, the chief pharmacy officer at the Cleveland Clinic. “We’re really still trying to get the information we need to manage it.”",4.0,9,"[4.0, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 5.0, 4.5, 3.5, 3.0, 4.0]"

George W. Bush and John McCain have each given speeches that read like broadsides against Trump — but very general critiques of his worldview, not political attacks on the man himself. And now Jeff Flake of Arizona has delivered a barnburner of a Senate address about the civic costs of the Trump presidency — while simultaneously declaring that because he can’t win his primary in a Trumpified party, he won’t even stay and fight it out.  To the extent that there’s a plausible theory behind all of these halfhearted efforts, it’s that resisting Trump too vigorously only strengthens his hold on the party’s base, by vindicating his claim to have all the establishment arrayed against him.  But the problem with this logic is that it offers a permanent excuse for doing nothing, no matter how bad Trump’s reign becomes. (“I’d criticize him for accidentally nuking Manila, but you know, then Fox News would just make it all about me …”) In the end, if you want Republican voters to reject Trumpism, you need to give them clear electoral opportunities to do so — even if you expect defeat, even if it’s all but certain. And an anti-Trump movement that gives high-minded speeches but never mounts candidates confirms Trump’s claim to face establishment opposition while also confirming his judgment of the establishment’s guts and stamina — proving that they’re all low-energy, all “liddle” men, all unwilling to fight him man to man.  If Corker really means what he keeps saying about the danger posed by Trump’s effective incapacity, he should call openly for impeachment or for 25th Amendment proceedings — and other anti-Trump Republicans should join him. If Flake really means what he said in his impassioned speech, and he doesn’t want to waste time and energy on a foredoomed Senate primary campaign, then he should choose a different hopeless-seeming cause and primary Trump in 2020. George W. Bush should endorse him. So should McCain, and Corker, and Romney, and Kasich, and Sasse, and the rest of the anti-Trump list. They should expect to lose, and badly, but they should make Trump actually defeat them, instead of just clearing the field for his second nomination.  And not only for the sake of their honor. The president’s G.O.P. critics should engage in electoral battle because the act of campaigning, the work of actually trying to persuade voters, is the only way anti-Trump Republicans will come to grips with the legitimate reasons that their ideas had become so unpopular that voters opted for demagoguery instead.  A speechifying anti-Trumpism, distant from the fray, will always be self-regarding and self-deceiving — unwilling to see how the Iraq War discredited both the Bushist and McCainian styles of right-wing internationalism, incapable of addressing the economic disappointments that turned voters against Flake’s Goldwaterite libertarianism and Romney’s “trust me, I’m a businessman” promises.

Your life is up to you. You’re not trapped in anything but your own despair. You hold the key. Stop telling yourself you don’t have the power to open the door. Everything about the language you use in describing your circumstances tells me you’re not aware of that. You write: “I want my life to change” rather than “I’m going to change my life.” The former is a passive expression of a desire; the later is an active decision. You can’t do the things you hope to do until you believe you have the capacity to do them. So that’s where to begin: by having a word with the inner voices of doom in your head and telling them to hush up. I understand why you might have those voices in your head (as someone who grew up poor in a small town and worked as a waitress, I really do), but the story you’ve told yourself about being “stuck forever” isn’t true and it doesn’t serve you. It’s time to tell yourself a different story instead.  Steve Almond: One way to begin telling that new story is to focus on the sort of life you want to lead. What emerges from your letter is mostly a desire to get out of town. But an exit plan isn’t the same thing as a destination. I love that you spend a lot of time picturing your life across the country. It tells me you’re ambitious and imaginative. What I want to know is what you envision yourself doing over there. How exactly do you want to spend your precious time on this earth? This may seem like a grandiose question, given how hard you’re working just to pay the bills on time. But it’s really not. Your new life begins the moment you start focusing on what you want, not just what you want to escape.  CS: So let’s get practical. Make a list of the things you want to do. The three you’ve cited in your letter are: move to a different part of the country, work a different job, and get an education, so let’s start there. Beneath each item on your list, make another list composed of the steps you need to take to achieve that thing. To get a new job you have to apply for one, for example. Be as specific as you can be with each item on your list and then start doing them, one by one. Some steps may require money, but others won’t. Perhaps one item beneath “get an education” is to study for college entrance exams. To do that, you can check out books from your local library. Another might be “research schools and financial aid.” That can be done online. You don’t have to do everything at once. You need only do one thing at a time. But the point is you have to do them, Broke. Each thing you do will bring you closer to the things you seek.  SA: Taking one step at a time is vital, because our popular culture is lousy with fairy tales of overnight transformation: paupers who ascend to the penthouse in the space of one Hollywood montage. This is our designated mythos, as Americans: that all you need to claim your destiny is a little pluck and luck. But more than anything, what you need is patience and humility and self-forgiveness. If you don’t have these attributes, you’re going to get discouraged. And then you’re going to get stuck. Because real change is rarely quick, and even more rarely glamorous. It resides in the small steps Cheryl speaks of, in the daily work of converting anguish into action. Fate did not deal you a hand of privilege.

The small slits for the fetoscopes are thought to reduce these risks.  To develop their fetoscopic procedure, Dr. Belfort and Dr. Whitehead operated on sheep and spent several hundred hours over the course of two years practicing on a simulator that they had created. It consisted of a rubber kickball, about the size of a basketball — like a uterus at 24 weeks of pregnancy — with a doll inside, wrapped in chicken skin that they cut to mimic the defect in spina bifida.  They would insert fetoscopes into the ball and, eyes on the monitor, work together to sew up the chicken skin.

It also argues that noncompetes make it harder for state employers to find the best people, reducing innovation and limiting the pool of workers that thriving businesses need to grow.  “It’s clearly a winning issue for attorneys general,” said Alan B. Krueger, a Princeton economics professor who was chairman of Mr. Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers.  In Illinois and elsewhere, much of the recent interest among legislators and attorneys general began a little over three years ago, when the Huffington Post reported that the Jimmy John’s sandwich chain required hourly sandwich makers and delivery drivers to sign noncompetes. Illinois sued Jimmy John’s last year, arguing that its noncompete agreement violated the state’s consumer fraud act — the new noncompete law hadn’t been passed yet — and reached a settlement in which the company agreed to remove the clause.  New York’s attorney general announced a similar settlement with Jimmy John’s.  Each time the Jimmy John’s case was in the news, the Illinois attorney general’s office received a round of calls from workers who felt they had signed an unfair noncompete agreement, including nurses, sales representatives, day care workers and cooks.  One complaint came from an undisclosed employee of Check Into Cash. Ms. Madigan said her office was investigating about a dozen companies over the use of noncompete agreements.

It applies to employers within 15 miles of any of the company’s more than 1,000 locations in the United States.

They included where to place the income limits for various tax brackets, whether to maintain or cut tax rates on top earners, and the fate of several critical components of the revamped corporate code.  Two issues in dispute flared up publicly: changes to retirement savings and to individuals’ ability to deduct their state and local taxes.  Mr. Brady seemed to defend a proposal to drastically lower the cap on tax-free retirement account contributions. He indicated that there were better ways to encourage the bulk of workers to save, even after Mr. Trump declared on Monday that “there will be NO change to your 401(k).”  “Right now, we are not a nation of savers,” Mr. Brady said at a breakfast convened by The Christian Science Monitor, adding: “We think in tax reform we can create incentives for Americans to save more and save sooner.”  Privately, though, a member of House leadership assured lobbyists on Wednesday that retirement account limits would not be touched in the draft bill.  House Republicans have been considering sharply reducing the amount that Americans are allowed to save, before taxes, in 401(k) retirement plans to $2,400 a year, from the current $18,000, or $24,000 for workers who are over 50.

Although there are worse things in the world than being stuck with Donald Trump as president. You could be locked in a cage with a ravenous tiger. Tied to the leg of a stampeding elephant. Locked in a small room with a swarm of rabid ferrets.  Truly, the list goes on. Stop complaining.  This week Trump denounced the Republicans’ tax plan before they even had one. He appeared to change his mind once again on immigration and kept the House and Senate dangling on health care. He also told reporters that “I’m a very intelligent person.” The only two things we can absolutely be confident about are that on almost any given day, Trump will refer to himself as intelligent and remind people how many electoral votes he won. For the rest, it’s anybody’s guess.  Republicans in Congress generally try to just soldier on, but some of them are starting to snap. Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona denounced his party’s president in a dramatic “I’m outta here” speech that Trump shrugged off, saying, “Even before the campaign he came out with this horrible book.” This would presumably be the anti-Trump book Flake published two months ago.  Did you know that Jeff Flake once appeared in a reality TV special called “Rival Survival”? I am bringing this up because there does seem to be a reality TV theme running through Washington.

Max Holland, a Washington writer and author of the 2004 book “The Kennedy Assassination Tapes,” said he believed expectations about potential revelations from the files were overblown.  He noted that while the documents have not been previously made public, they all were seen years ago by the J.F.K. Assassination Records Review Board and were unlikely to significantly affect the official story. He cautioned against conspiratorial thinking that runs against the evidence, which he finds persuasive, that Oswald alone killed Kennedy.  “I can understand why people are curious,” Mr. Holland said. “But the level of distrust in this country is such that people will believe anything. The problem is really with us.”  Indeed, the Kennedy assassination has continued to intrigue and puzzle the American public long after most of the main players have died. While the Warren Commission concluded that Oswald acted alone, most people have never accepted the official version of events. A poll by Gallup in 2013, at the time of the 50th anniversary, found that 61 percent of Americans still believed that others besides Oswald were involved — and that was the lowest percentage of skeptics found in nearly a half century.  “We just have to realize that there is never going to be an explanation of the Kennedy assassination that will satisfy everyone,” Mr. Beschloss said. “That will never happen.

But Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, who recommended Mr. Kelly to Mr. Trump last winter, said the retired general’s background gave him an understanding of the dangers and drawbacks of unfettered immigration. “He knows a lot of the challenges that we face south of the border,” Mr. Cotton said, adding that the issue is “something that he’s lived on a firsthand basis for years.”  Like Mr. Panetta, he pointed to Mr. Kelly’s upbringing.  “I think he appreciates the struggles of America’s working class — the blue-collar workers over the last 30, 40 years, the kind of people who have to take a shower after they get off work, not before they go to work — and the impact that mass unskilled and low-skilled immigration has had on working-class wages in our society,” Mr. Cotton said.

But Republicans just might be on the verge of accomplishing this — all in an effort to game the budget process.”  Even though President Trump said on Twitter that there would be no changes to 401(k) plans, Ms. Olen explains, the issue is not as resolved as he would have you believe. On Wednesday, there were reports that the retirement savings plans were still up for negotiation. Ms. Olen argues that the problem is not just Mr. Trump’s shifting positions on the retirement accounts, but, more broadly, how willing Republicans are to toy with retirement plans “all in an effort to game the budget process.” Read more »  _____  Finally, From the Center  Veronique de Rugy in Reason:    “The good news is that there’s a debate in Washington about how to make the tax code less destructive. The bad news is that lawmakers will be able to achieve much less than they otherwise could because of bad policy priorities.”  Ms. de Rugy, writing for the libertarian Reason, accuses Republicans of being fiscally irresponsible with their tax plan. She says she worries that “failing to restrain spending today while cutting taxes means that taxes will have to go up in the future to pay for larger deficits.” She adds that while it may be politically expedient, giving the middle class a large tax cut is counterproductive: “There’s very little economic growth to be expected from reducing the marginal tax rates on middle-income earners.” Read more »  _____  Justin Fox in Bloomberg:  “I figure this is as good a time as any to run through what’s wrong with the 401(k), or at least what’s wrong with having made it a centerpiece of our country’s retirement savings system.”  Mr. Fox explains why the 401(k) tax break should not be “untouchable,” even if it is politically popular. Millions of taxpayers benefit from the plan, he writes, but far more get nothing from it. “If the idea is to actually reduce the tax deductions for retirement savings, not just shift them across time,” he argues, “it’s maybe not so crazy.” Read more »  _____  Josh Barro in Business Insider:  “If you’re going to give a tax break for business income, you have to clearly define what’s a business and what’s just work.

Then the work has to be vetted and approved by an Institutional Review Board, which safeguards subjects from potential harm. I.R.B.s are especially vigilant when studies involve children, a vulnerable group. Even if the research is of minimal risk, this process can take months.  Then there’s getting permission from schools to do the work. As you can imagine, many are resistant to allowing research on their premises. Often, protocols and rules require getting permission from parents to allow their children to be part of studies. If parents (understandably) refuse, figuring out how to do the work without involving some children can be tricky.  Finally, many methodological decisions come into play. Let’s imagine that we want to do a simple test of cookies versus apples, plus or minus stickers — as this study did. It’s possible that children eat different things on different days, so we need to make sure that we test them on multiple days of the week. It’s possible that they might change their behavior once, but then go back to their old ways, so we need to test responses over time.  It’s possible that handing out the cookie or apple personally might change behavior more than just leaving the choices out for display. If that’s the case, we need to stay hidden and observe unobtrusively. This matters because in the real world it’s probably not feasible to have someone handing out these foods in schools, and we need the methods to mirror what will most likely happen later. It’s also possible that the choices might differ based on whether children can take both the apple and the cookie (in which case they could get the sticker and the treat) or whether they had to choose one.  I point out all these things to reinforce that this type of research isn’t as simple as many might initially think. Without addressing these questions, and more, the work may be flawed or not easily generalized.  These difficulties are some of the reasons so much research on food and nutrition is done with animals, like mice. We don’t need to worry as much about I.R.B.s or getting a school on board. We don’t have to worry about mice noticing who’s recording data. And we can control what they’re offered to eat, every meal of every day.

There was that one in New York that sold students a $35,000 “Gold Elite Package” and had to change its name to “Entrepreneur Initiative” after the state determined it had no right to call itself a university. …  “The outcomes for people who take out loans at for-profits are abysmal,” said Ben Miller of the Center for American Progress. He added that almost all the students borrow, for courses they could sometimes get for one sixth the price at a community college. And about half the people who borrow default.  As the stories about deceitful for-profits mounted, the Obama administration came up with regulations making it easier for students to refuse to pay their loans if a school had misrepresented their chances of graduating and getting a lucrative career. The rules were supposed to go into effect in July, but DeVos has delayed their implementation.  Insiders call those regulations “borrower defense to repayment.” However, if you prefer, you could also refer to them as “something that reminds us of a certain school that used to promise its students fabulous careers in the real estate industry. …”  O.K., we’re talking here about Trump University.

They said it would expand output by 3 to 5 percent over the long run, a period left unspecified.  The complication is that faster growth could undermine the party’s case that tax cuts are needed to add fuel to an economy that is already running with low unemployment — and it could lead the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates more quickly, which could dampen the effects of any tax bill.  Liberal economists said the report showed the success of Ms. Yellen at the Fed and undermined the case for the Republican tax bill. “The underlying trend in G.D.P. growth is clearly telling us two things,” Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser to President Barack Obama who is now at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said by email. “Keep on rockin’ steady with Yellen at the Fed, and there’s no need for a big, wasteful tax cut.”  The Fed, judging that the economy is growing about as fast as it can, is on course to raise its benchmark interest rate in December to a level Fed officials have described as likely neither to encourage nor to discourage growth. The Fed’s plans do not reflect the potential economic impact of a tax cut.  Aside from the details of the legislation, the Fed’s reaction may also depend on its leadership. Mr. Trump is expected to announce next week whom he will nominate to lead the Fed after Ms. Yellen’s term ends in early February.

Mr. Trump’s choice, by contrast, could have significant consequences for the direction of Fed policy. Mr. Powell, who supported the Fed’s efforts to stimulate economic growth, now favors a gradual unwinding of those policies. Mr. Taylor opposed the stimulus campaign, and he has called for the Fed to retreat more quickly.  “If you’re taking seriously reappointing Yellen or nominating Powell, well, that’s light-years away from Taylor,” Ms. Binder said. “It just raises the question: What is the basis on which the president is conducting the search?”  One possible explanation is that Mr. Trump is struggling with the imperatives of a polarized political environment. He has repeatedly praised Ms. Yellen for her performance as Fed chairwoman. The economy is growing and the stock market is rising, and Mr. Trump wants both trends to continue. But conservatives are pressing Mr. Trump to seize the opportunity to shift the approach of the central bank by appointing Mr. Taylor.  Three House Republicans, including Representative Warren Davidson of Ohio, sent a letter to Mr. Trump on Wednesday pressing for new leadership at the Fed. Republicans want to constrain the Fed’s conduct of monetary policy, and to install a Fed chairman who is supportive of efforts to reduce financial regulation.  Some of Mr. Trump’s advisers, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, favor the nomination of Mr. Powell as a kind of middle road: a Republican likely to maintain the Fed’s course on monetary policy, but with greater sympathy for relaxing financial regulation.",3.108695652173913,46,"[3.5, 0.5, 3.0, 2.0, 2.5, 5.0, 4.0, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 0.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.0, 0.5, 4.5, 2.5, 3.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 1.5, 5.0, 0.5, 4.0, 2.5, 1.0, 4.0, 5.0, 1.0, 0.5, 3.5, 3.5, 1.0, 4.5, 2.5, 4.0, 3.5, 1.5, 3.0, 4.5, 3.0, 4.5, 4.5]"

She was in a college dorm room at the University of Maryland dressed in an R2-D2 swimsuit and high athletic socks. She sat on a twin bed, next to a wooden desk, and spoke to the camera as if it were a real person. There was no story line and no other actors.  “It was a solo masturbation scene,” she said. “I was coy and flirty and then a little bit dirty. I felt sexy as hell.”  Ms. Darling had been filming pornography since she was 22 and took her job seriously. It was her responsibility to convince audiences to connect with her physically and emotionally. She tried everything, including acting out bondage fetishes, performing erotic electrostimulation (“electrosex”) on another woman and dressing as a real-estate agent. Yet no matter what she did to entice and engage, the results had always been voyeuristic, since there was always a screen separating her and her fans.  This time, though, was different. Virtual reality uses many camera lenses to record the same scene from hundreds of angles. When the takes are stitched together, the viewer gets a 180- or 240-degree view of the room and the feeling that he or she is there, participating. As soon as Ms. Darling viewed the scene she recorded, she knew virtual reality would be a sea change to her job and the adult-entertainment industry.",3.7,5,"[4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 2.5, 5.0]"

The sneakers arrived in a few days, and I was satisfied with them.    Then came the targeted ads.    Over the next week I was hounded by online ads for the same sneakers I’d bought, along with others I’d rejected and many more I hadn’t even seen.

Consider the debate within the party on Senator Bernie Sanders’s “Medicare for All” bill, which most (though not all) 2020 contenders rushed to attach themselves to. To fail to sign on to that legislation is to open oneself to criticism, even abuse, although it’s less a piece of legislation than a goal.  Forget about who’s right and wrong in these debates. Time will sort that out. My point is that they tend to consume a party experiencing a shift. The Democratic Party, because it is an amalgam of interest groups in a way the Republican Party is not, has always had a tendency to elevate the candidate who can check the most boxes. The current internal dynamics exacerbate that. It’s also worth remembering that no one besides party activists cares.  So when the party’s leaders tussle over this or that policy, they also need to take a step back, to see the direction the country — the West itself — is heading, and take a stand on it. This isn’t just a matter of high-minded idealism; it’s what separates great politicians from merely good ones.  History tells us that the transformative politicians, the ones who can change the country’s direction and will really matter in the history books, are the ones who can do both. I think there have been four of them in the past century: Franklin Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.  Why Roosevelt and Reagan should be obvious. I know some would dispute my choice of Mr. Clinton, but he rescued a party that had lost three presidential elections in a row and was being read last rites by some pundits in 1991 (the extent to which he changed the country’s fundamental direction is debatable). Mr. Obama made history and redrew the electoral map. All four were able to speak both to their base and beyond it by identifying the challenge of the moment and persuading majorities that they had some answers.  The future of the Western democratic project is the fundamental issue of our era. It’s under attack from Vladimir Putin and Steve Bannon and many people in between (and to the extent that he backs Mr. Bannon’s purge of the Republican Party, from the president himself; think about that).  Democrats can’t duck this question and expect the broader electorate to see them as prepared to lead. To his credit, Mr. Sanders did talk a bit about all this in a foreign-policy speech in late September at the same Missouri college where Winston Churchill gave his Iron Curtain speech, noting an “international order” that is “under great strain.”  The Democrats were the party that created this order after World War II. They must now be the party that fixes and saves it.",2.6666666666666665,9,"[4.5, 3.0, 1.5, 0.5, 0.5, 3.5, 5.0, 2.0, 3.5]"

The Trump administration in June released a plan for reducing regulation, much of which can be carried out by the Fed and other regulators without legislation. The changes would exempt smaller banks from many postcrisis regulations, and loosen restrictions on larger banks. That would let banks borrow more freely, and take more risks with that money.  At a hearing a few weeks after the plan was released, Mr. Powell offered a tepid review. “I see it is a mixed bag,” he said. “There are some ideas in the report that make sense, maybe not as expressed there, but it would enable us to reduce the cost of regulation without affecting safety and soundness.” But, he added, “There are some ideas that I would not support.”  Since joining the Fed in May 2012, Mr. Powell has voted in favor of every action to tighten regulation the Fed has undertaken. But he has sometimes expressed concerns in internal discussions about the effects of those decisions, and about the aggregate weight of so many new regulations.  At the June hearing, he said that there were clear opportunities for improvement.  “The whole idea is to preserve the significant core reforms that were made but to go back and clean up our work,” he said.  Specifically, Mr. Powell wants to overhaul the Volcker Rule, which is intended to prevent big banks from making certain kinds of risky investments with their own money. Mr. Powell and other Fed officials have long regarded the rule as costly and ineffective, in part because they say it duplicates other measures aimed at limiting risk-taking.",2.75,4,"[5.0, 1.5, 4.0, 0.5]"

The companies argued against the ad disclosure bill and dragged their feet to participate in a hearing on Tuesday. Lobbyists for Facebook explained how their voluntary efforts on political ad disclosures could work better than regulations.  Twitter has not addressed its problems with automated accounts, known as bots, that can quickly spread propaganda or fake news. In addition, not all social media companies have announced that they will tighten rules for buying political ads, one of the most pressing issues. And even if they do, lawmakers should still make more disclosure a legal requirement, said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat from Minnesota, who is a co-sponsor of the disclosure bill with Mr. Warner and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona.  “If their policies comply with our bill, they should support our bill and maybe can use their policy as a standard when we pass our bill,” Ms. Klobuchar said.  Much of the harshest criticism so far is coming from Democrats like Mr. Warner and Ms. Klobuchar, which could limit the fallout for the tech companies. The Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr. Burr, has been more reserved than Mr. Warner, for example.  Many Republicans are reluctant to add any regulations to businesses.

Mr. Manafort got his start in politics on the presidential campaigns of Gerald R. Ford and Ronald Reagan and made his fortune outside of electoral politics in lobbying. His work on the Trump campaign, rather than being a crowning achievement, instead commenced a series of events that would set the stage for his downfall. And Mr. Gates, a longtime protégé of Mr. Manafort’s who was also charged, found himself deeply entangled in the Russia inquiry.  Mr. Papadopoulos’s plea revealed that the Trump campaign had early word that Russia had Democrats’ stolen emails.  The plea of Mr. Papadopoulos, a young foreign policy consultant whom Mr. Trump once praised as an “excellent guy,” shifted the narrative of the Trump campaign’s interactions with Russia, revealing that Russian officials alerted the campaign, through an intermediary in April 2016, that they possessed thousands of Democratic emails and other “dirt” on Mrs. Clinton.  According to the plea documents, Mr. Papadopoulos repeatedly tried to set up a meeting between campaign officials and the Russian government.  Mr. Trump and his advisers said the charges did not prove collusion with Russia.  The White House said that the indictments had nothing to do with Mr. Trump or his election campaign and instead sought to refocus attention on Democrats and their actions during the race. Shortly after the charges were announced, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter: “Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren’t Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????” In a second tweet, minutes later, he added, “....Also, there is NO COLLUSION!”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  But despite a White House response at times peppered with misleading and obfuscating claims, Monday’s developments propelled the investigation into a new and more dangerous phase for Mr. Trump and amounted to a political body blow to a president who has spent months insisting that the investigation was nothing more than a “witch hunt” based on a “hoax.”  The charges are a significant escalation in the Russia inquiry.  The special counsel leading the investigation, Robert S. Mueller III, was assigned in May to look into whether anyone close to Mr. Trump participated in a Russian government effort to influence last year’s presidential election.

Grahn of the Veterinary Genetics Laboratory at the University of California, Davis.  But cat whiskers do not seem to follow the same pigmentation patterns observed in other hair types.

When Robert Lighthizer, Mr. Trump’s top trade negotiator, cut his teeth on trade diplomacy, back during the presidency of Ronald Reagan, the United States had an idiosyncratic way of solving its grievances over trade: asking its trading partners to curb their exports, or else.  In the early 1980s, Japan signed on to “voluntary export restraints” to curb the exports of Toyotas, Hondas and Nissans that were causing so much heartburn in Detroit. “Voluntary restraint agreements” were negotiated with 15 countries that accounted for 80 percent of American steel imports.  They were voluntary in the sense that foreign exporters preferred these agreements over the threat of punitive duties. In Washington, they were popular. As the Dartmouth College economist Douglas Irwin notes in his timely new book, “Clashing Over Commerce: A History of U.S. Trade Policy,” the share of American imports covered by some form of trade restriction rose to 21 percent in 1984, from only 8 percent in 1975.

He is the prosecutor they would want if their relatives were charged with crimes they did not commit, they say, and the one they would dread if their family members were guilty.  “If there’s something to find, he’ll find it,” said Katya Jestin, a former colleague in the United States attorney’s office for the Eastern District of New York, who called Mr. Weissmann’s ethics unimpeachable. “If there’s nothing there, he’s not going to cook something up.”  But many defense lawyers have chafed at what they see as a scorched-earth approach, forged in Brooklyn while facing down Mafia members and refined on the government’s unit of Enron superprosecutors, which left a mixed legacy of high-profile successes, overturned convictions and one unanimous defeat at the Supreme Court.  It was Mr. Weissmann and his team who stunned Houston society by charging the wife of Enron’s chief financial officer with tax fraud, applying pressure on the executive, who became a star witness.

He and his brother could Drain The Swamp, which would be yet another campaign promise fulfilled.

Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services, rose at a 3 percent annual rate in the third quarter of the year, the second straight quarter of solid growth. Measures of retail sales and consumer confidence have likewise been strong, and most economists expect the next round of employment figures, due Friday, to show a solid rebound from September’s dip.  “Much of the uncertainty that had existed at the September meetings because of the hurricanes has subsided and signs are that growth has been stronger,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com.  The one sticking point remains inflation. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation is well below the central bank’s 2 percent target; what’s more, inflation has slowed this year even as the unemployment rate has fallen, a trend that would ordinarily be expected to put upward pressure on prices. That disconnect has complicated the Fed’s plans to raise interest rates at the steady clip it has signaled, including three more times next year.  Ms. Yellen and most of her colleagues have expressed confidence that the slowdown in inflation is temporary and therefore should not force a change in plans. In a September speech, Ms. Yellen said that low unemployment is leading to pay increases, which will ultimately lead to higher prices as well; other Fed officials have made similar comments in recent weeks.  Still, at some point “temporary” effects stop looking so temporary. The Fed will get several more reports on inflation before its December meeting, and it remains possible that weak data could give policymakers pause.  Financial markets appear all but certain that the Fed plans to raise rates in December.

Very sad.”  In the criminal complaint charging Mr. Saipov, the F.B.I. said it had read him the Miranda warning, but he had voluntarily waived those rights and told interrogators that he had been inspired to carry out the attack after watching Islamic State propaganda videos.

Sometimes patients get stents when they have no pain at all, just blockages.

Congress has, in effect, set aside $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years to pay for revisions to the tax code, but to keep the cost of the plan to that limit, the Republican leadership is relying on financing gimmicks to phase in some provisions, or put time limits on others.  A proposal that allows companies to immediately deduct business expenses rather than stretching them over a number of years potentially has the most impact on smaller companies that need money to build up or expand their business. Indeed a hefty chunk of the administration’s growth estimates is based on the extra investing it is supposed to cause.  But the proposal has a five-year time limit. “If expensing goes away at the end of 2022, they should not expect any permanent growth effect,” said Mr. Viard of the American Enterprise Institute.  For businesses, predictability about the tax code is as important as any specific alteration. And temporary measures that obscure the costs deter long-term investment. New low rates and breaks will not be sustainable over the long term if they do not provide enough money to run the government.  “If they want to claim credit for the growth effect,” Mr. Viard said, “then they have to claim responsibility for the revenue loss.”  All would-be tax reformers juggle varying goals. They want to entice domestic and foreign companies to invest in the United States, which should, in turn, produce more jobs and stockholder returns.  They want to create a system that is widely judged as fair.  And they need to collect enough revenue to keep the lights on.

So it is a relief that he picked a levelheaded and competent person to lead the Federal Reserve, whose authority to direct interest rates and supervise banks gives it enormous influence over the economy.  By choosing Jerome Powell, a Republican respected across the political spectrum, Mr. Trump has opted for continuity and stability, rather than disruption and destruction. Mr. Powell has been a solid member of the Fed board since 2012 and has supported its current chairwoman, Janet Yellen, and her predecessor, Ben Bernanke, as they worked to revive the economy.  Mr. Powell appears to share Ms. Yellen’s view that while the economy has improved a lot in recent years, the time is not right for the Fed to raise interest rates rapidly and substantially. He is a far better choice than other candidates Mr. Trump was said to be considering. They included critics of the Fed who claimed in the wake of the 2008 crisis that the central bank was sowing the seeds for out-of-control inflation. (Almost a decade later there is still no sign of that.) Other potential nominees have advocated for the deregulation of banks, which could imperil the financial system.  That said, Mr. Trump would have made a much better decision had he offered Ms. Yellen a second term, in keeping with a tradition in which presidents have reappointed Fed leaders who were seen to be doing a good job, regardless of party affiliation. As Mr. Trump noted himself, Ms. Yellen has done a terrific job during a precarious time. Under her watch, unemployment fell to 4.1 percent last month, from 6.7 percent when she took over in 2014, and inflation has been well below the Fed’s 2 percent target.

The smoke from fires affects not only health, the report says, but visibility.  Adaptation, adaptation, adaptation  Since 2014, more detailed economic research has estimated that climate change could cause hundreds of billions of dollars in annual damage, as deadly heat waves, coastal flooding, and an increase in extreme weather take their toll. Unless, that is, communities take steps to prepare beforehand.  The previous assessment warned that few states and cities were taking steps to adapt to the impacts of climate change. That’s slowly changing, the new draft finds. More and more communities are taking measures such as preserving wetlands along the coasts to act as buffers against storms.  But outside of a few places in Louisiana and Alaska, few coastal communities are rethinking their development patterns in order to avoid the impacts from rising seas and severe weather that the report says are surely coming.

Earnings growth, at least before adjusting for inflation, has accelerated a bit in recent years. And more sophisticated measures show somewhat stronger gains. The Employment Cost Index, a measure of compensation that considers benefits as well as cash pay, was up 2.5 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, its fastest pace in two and a half years.  Some industries are seeing faster growth — and not just for high-earners. In recent months, there have been hints that wage gains are filtering down to workers in fast food and other low-wage industries. In September, the retail giant Target announced that it was raising pay for all its workers to at least $11 an hour and would pay at least $15 an hour by the end of 2020. That move, and others like it, is putting pressure on other low-wage employers to increase pay.  “It’s really hard to retain employees when those companies are saying, ‘Any employee in our company is getting at least $15 an hour,’” said Jennifer Durham, chief development officer for Checkers and Rally’s, a drive-through burger chain with 860 locations across the country.  So far, however, Checkers and Rally’s has resisted broad-based pay increases, choosing instead to focus on helping employees earn more through advancement.  “Base pay is a starting point, but it’s not the entire proposition,” Ms. Durham said.  Republicans in Washington in recent weeks have proposed their own solution to slow wage growth: lower taxes on businesses, which they argue would lead to big pay increases for workers. Many economists are skeptical that companies would pass tax savings on to workers, or argue that the benefits of the Republicans’ proposed tax plan would be far smaller than its authors claim.  Instead, economists point to another factor holding back wage gains: productivity. Growth in productivity — how much workers can produce in an hour, on average — has been slow, making it harder for companies to improve wages without eating into profit margins.  “It’s hard to get wages really taking off without productivity growth,” Mr. Ryan said.  Productivity growth accelerated in the third quarter, though it is too soon to know whether the that represents the start of a longer-lasting rebound. And despite the disappointing pay data, there are signs that companies are being forced to work harder to attract employees, and to keep the ones they have from bolting to competitors.

The Fed announced in September 2012 that it would launch a third round of bond buying, purchasing $85 billion a month in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities until economic conditions improved to its satisfaction. The program was backed by Mr. Bernanke, then Fed chair, and Ms. Yellen, then the vice chairwoman, who argued the Fed had not done enough to reduce unemployment.  A group of three Fed governors, including Mr. Powell, pressed Mr. Bernanke to clarify the Fed’s goals, establishing what Mr. Powell called an “off-ramp” for the program.  Mr. Trump will have the opportunity to reshape the Fed further through appointments in the coming months, which could help consolidate or complicate Mr. Powell’s task of forging consensus.

But the legislation includes several land mines that could complicate its passage, including limits on the popular mortgage interest deduction and caps on the state and local tax deduction, as well as its overall cost. Several Republicans from the high-tax states of New York and New Jersey said the bill would need to change to gain their support, while powerful trade groups representing the real estate industry and small businesses blasted the bill as ineffective and harmful to Americans.  “Contrary to their assertions, the Republicans are picking winners and losers,” Jerry Howard, the chief executive of the National Association of Homebuilders, said in an interview. “They are picking rich Americans and corporations over small businesses and the middle class.”  Meanwhile, Senate Republicans are working on their own tax bill, and on Thursday, Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, lobbed a grenade into the House plan over its cost.  “As I have made clear from the beginning of this debate, it is my hope that the final legislation — while allowing for current policy assumptions and reasonable dynamic scoring — will not add to the deficit, sets rates that are permanent in nature and closes a minimum of $4 trillion in loopholes and special interest deductions,” Mr. Corker said.  Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said that the House plan had the “full support” of Mr. Trump and predicted that it would be on the president’s desk this year. Anticipating the resistance from industry groups, Mr. Brady said, “We’re going to prove them wrong once and for all.”  Representative Peter Roskam, Republican of Illinois and a member of the Ways and Means Committee, said he was bracing for the lobbyist onslaught but would not be deterred.

My phone has all kinds of messages and there are all kinds of criticisms,” he said. “The notion of just defending the status quo is insufferable, and we’re not going to do it.”  Slide Show  The bill is estimated to cost $1.5 trillion over a decade, and lawmakers must keep it at that amount if they are to pass it along party lines and avoid a filibuster by Democrats. Lawmakers have been scrambling for days to find revenue to offset tax cuts that will cost trillions of dollars. That has prompted a host of changes on the individual side, including repealing tax breaks for things like medical expenses, moving expenses, student loan interest and adoption, as well as making some business tax breaks temporary.  The benefits for individual taxpayers will be mixed and depend largely on where they fall on the income scale, where they live and the types of tax breaks they tend to claim.  Those making up to $24,000 will pay no income tax. For married taxpayers filing jointly, earnings up to $90,000 would be taxed in the 12 percent bracket; earnings up to $260,000 would fall in the 25 percent bracket; and earnings up to $1 million would be taxed at the 35 percent rate. For unmarried individuals and those filing separately, the bracket thresholds would be half of these amounts, other than the 35 percent bracket, which would be $200,000 for unmarried individuals.  The proposal roughly doubles the standard deduction for middle-class families, expanding it to $24,000 for married couples, from $12,700, and setting it at $12,000 for individuals, from $6,530 today. Republicans also plan to expand the child tax credit to $1,600 from $1,000 and add a $300 credit for each parent and nonchild dependent, such as older family members, though that credit would expire after five years.  But it also tightens rules for claiming the child tax credit, a change that would hit immigrant parents whose children were born in the United States. Filers would need to provide a “work-eligible Social Security number” rather than just a taxpayer identification number in order to claim the credit. The left-leaning Center on Budget Policy and Priorities said the bill would roll back eligibility for about three million children in working families, including about 80 percent of whom were born in the United States.  The bill includes a host of other changes that will affect taxpayers in different ways. For instance, it repeals certain tax credits, including a 15 percent credit for individuals aged 65 or over or who are retired on disability. Right now, those individuals can claim up to $7,500 for a joint return, $5,000 for a single individual, or $3,750 for a married individual filing a joint return.  The House bill would entirely repeal that tax credit. It would also repeal the adoption tax credit, no longer allow deductions for tax preparation and repeal credits for alimony payments. And deductions for moving expenses would no longer be allowed.

Under the Republican plan, existing homeowners can keep the deduction, but future purchases will be capped at $500,000, down from the current $1 million limit.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The National Association of Realtors came out swinging against the bill, suggesting a huge fight awaits over how real estate is treated.  “Eliminating or nullifying the tax incentives for homeownership puts home values and middle-class homeowners at risk, and from a cursory examination this legislation appears to do just that,” said William E. Brown, the president of the association. “We will have additional details upon a more thorough reading of the bill.”  Mr. Howard of the homebuilders group said the bill was a broken promise.  “It puts such severe limitations on homebuyers’ ability to use the mortgage interest deduction that home values will fall,” he said.  Another area of contention is the bill’s treatment of the state and local tax deduction, which is popular among many middle- and upper-middle-class taxpayers in high-cost states like New Jersey, New York and California. The House bill would limit the deduction to just property taxes, rather than state and local income taxes and general sales taxes, and cap the benefit at $10,000.  Several Republican lawmakers said they would oppose the bill in its current form, including Representatives Leonard Lance and Frank A. LoBiondo of New Jersey.  The proposal will double the estate tax exemption to roughly $11 million, from $5.49 million, meaning families can avoid paying taxes on large inheritance. And it eventually repeals the estate tax altogether, phasing it out entirely in six years.  Business groups that include large multinationals praised the bill effusively for lowering corporate rates permanently and sharply, and for overhauling the international tax system.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  For the first time, the United States is proposing to effectively levy a global minimum tax of 10 percent, which would apply to income that high-profit subsidiaries of American companies earn anywhere in the world. The effort is aimed at preventing companies from shifting profits abroad and grabbing back some of the tax revenue on income earned overseas. Those profits are currently not taxed until they are returned to the United States, giving companies an incentive to keep that money offshore since they are taxed at the current corporate tax rate of 35 percent.  The White House has said more than $2.5 trillion in American profits are held offshore.  The bill would force companies to pay a one-time 12 percent tax on liquid assets held overseas, like cash. The tax, which is reduced from the current 35 percent tax rate, would be payable over eight years. For illiquid assets, like equipment or property, the tax rate would be 5 percent.  It would also force American subsidiaries of foreign-owned companies to pay a 20 percent excise tax on any payments sent back to foreign affiliates.  Neil Bradley, the chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, called the bill a “home run” for economic growth and warned other groups against blocking it. “Everyone’s going to look at this and find something they don’t like,” Mr. Bradley said. “So they are going to have to decide? Am I going to help get this done?”  Among those less sanguine about the bill are small businesses, which said the bill does not go far enough to help them reduce their tax burden. Republicans stuck to their promise of lowering the tax rate for “pass through” businesses to 25 percent. But to prevent the rate from becoming a loophole for all sorts of individuals, tax writers have created a formula they say will ensure that business owners will pay a higher individual tax rate on income that they receive as wages. The formula would be applied based on the circumstances of the business.  That provision is not enough to satisfy the National Federation of Independent Business, which said in a statement it is “unable to support the House tax reform plan in its current form.”  Placing even more pressure on lawmakers, the Peter G. Peterson Foundation is planning to spend $6 million on a nationwide ad campaign, including a TV commercial, that warns against a tax plan that adds to the national debt.  The message of the campaign is that overhauling the tax code “should grow the economy, not the debt,” said Michael A.

1387,2996,11,4,2017,2017-11-04,The New York Times,Opinion | Everything Is Bad. Blame the Tax Code.,"All of that means that when it comes time for Republicans to make good on their years of promises about tax reform, they freeze up. Because they like being able to manipulate people, institutions and industries via the tax code.  This is not entirely Donald Trump’s fault (for once). The Republican Party’s allergy to closing loopholes predates his presidency. Since 1986 — the last serious, successful effort to simplify the tax code — being a signatory to Grover Norquist’s Taxpayer Protection Pledge has been the cost of admission into civilized Republican society. The pledge binds signatories to oppose all increases in marginal income tax rates for individuals and businesses. It also requires that they oppose the elimination of deductions and other loopholes unless increased revenue is offset by reductions elsewhere. What the pledge very carefully does not ask signatories to do is to cut spending.  In other words, nearly all Republican members of Congress have signed a deal that makes it politically unappealing (though not impossible) to eliminate loopholes. It allows them to wear the badge of fiscal conservatism without cutting spending. At the end of all those decades of distortion: the new Republican tax plan, with its cuts in the corporate tax rate, an increase of the standard deduction, some fiddling with income tax rates in different brackets and absolutely nothing in the way of simplification, rationalization or believable revenue neutrality.  Rumor has it that Mr. Trump felt pretty strongly about naming the bill the Cut Cut Cut Act. This is consistent with the fiscal plank of nearly every Republican primary contender, best summed up as “cut taxes first, ask questions later.” In fact, the bill is called the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but the sentiment is there.  There are quite a few Republicans who have made no secret of the fact that they’re holding their noses and working with Mr. Trump in order to get tax reform. The House speaker, Paul Ryan, as sincere a fiscal reformer as one can hope to see in leadership, was described as saying last week that he and the House Ways and Means Committee were “turning the dials” on the plan. By strategically phasing out certain provisions and plugging in optimistic growth estimates, the Republicans might get the math to work on paper. But in reality, no one seemed to know where the offsetting hundreds of billions in revenue will come from, and for every door the plan closes, it opens a window.  Everyone lies to the tax man, knowingly or unknowingly. That’s why howling for the president’s tax returns is an ever-present background noise in the nation’s capital: Reporters know there are likely to be exaggerations, bold deductions and envelope-pushing maneuvers aplenty in there, because they’ve done the same on their own returns.  People hate taxes because they hate to be pushed around. But politicians love taxes because it’s their job to push people around, and taxes are a powerful tool to do just that. A “tax return you can fill out on the back of a postcard” — long promised by the Republican Party — would essentially be a decision by the political class to unilaterally disarm itself. And that’s not going to happen.",4.285714285714286,7,"[4.0, 5.0, 4.5, 5.0, 4.0, 4.5, 3.0]"
1389,2998,11,4,2017,2017-11-04,The New York Times,Opinion | Obamacare vs. the Saboteurs,"Despite the best efforts of the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress to destroy the Affordable Care Act, the law is not collapsing. And on Wednesday, Americans began signing up for health insurance policies for next year through the online exchanges created by that law.  President Trump’s attempts at sabotage have clearly taken a toll on the A.C.A., or Obamacare. Experts say it is likely that one million to two million fewer people will choose health plans for 2018, compared with 2017. That’s because the administration has reduced the open enrollment period by half, to 45 days. And it has slashed spending on advertising and on health care navigators who help people sign up for insurance plans.  Further, Mr. Trump has said Obamacare is “finished,” “dead” and “gone” — and his words appear to be having an impact. A recent poll found that a sizable minority of voters think the law has been repealed. Others are unaware of when open enrollment started (Nov. 1) and when it will end (Dec. 15 for much of the country). The president’s remarks and actions have also scared insurance companies into raising premiums — by about 37 percent for popular “silver” plans, and by smaller amounts for the “bronze” and “gold” plans — because the administration is cutting payments to insurers, and the companies are expecting fewer healthy people to buy coverage.  That said, a majority of the people who rely on the exchanges will be able to buy affordable health plans, thanks to the protections built into the law. About 80 percent of the people who sign up are expected to qualify for subsidies that will reduce the cost of insurance to $75 a month or less, according to government data. The law provides subsidies to single people who make up to $48,000 a year and families of four earning up to $98,000.",3.7777777777777777,9,"[5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0, 2.0, 4.0, 2.5]"

Daniel Stiles, a self-styled ape trafficking detective in Kenya, had been scouring Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp for weeks, looking for pictures of gorillas, chimps or orangutans. He was hoping to chip away at an illicit global trade that has captured or killed tens of thousands of apes and pushed some endangered species to the brink of extinction.  “The way they do business,” he said of ape traffickers, “makes the Mafia look like amateurs.”  After hundreds of searches, Mr. Stiles found an Instagram account offering dozens of rare animals for sale, including baby chimpanzees and orangutans dressed in children’s clothes. He sent an email to an address on the account — “looking for young otans” (the industry standard slang for orangutans) — and several days later received a reply.  “2 babies, 7.5k each. Special introductory price.”  The trafficker identified himself only as Tom and said he was based in Southeast Asia. Mr. Stiles knew what Tom was hoping for: to sell the infant orangutans to a private collector or unscrupulous zoo, where they are often beaten or drugged into submission and used for entertainment like mindlessly banging on drums or boxing one another. Such ape shows are a growing business in Southeast Asia, despite international regulations that prohibit trafficking in endangered apes.  Several weeks later, after a few more rounds of text messages with Tom to firm up the details, Mr. Stiles decided to fly to Bangkok.  “I was way out on a limb,” Mr. Stiles admitted later.

Lytro’s camera is the size of a sumo wrestler. It gathers about 475 times more visual information than we do for a standard VR piece. Lytro’s system also features Six Degrees of Freedom (6DoF), which enables the viewer in aheadset to move around within the piece. If you are standing in front of a person, you can close the distance to them or step farther away. If you are watching an animation, you can crouch down or swivel to the side to see what the image looks like from a different angle. This freedom of movement increases the sense that you are right there with Rachel. It’s what we call “presence” — the magic of VR.  During this process, we were also working closely with Brendan Baker, a sound designer whom I knew from his work on the podcast “Love + Radio,” which is known for its innovative use of sound in storytelling. I thought of him as the mad scientist of the podcast world, which was exactly what we needed to create a sound design that could accurately represent the sounds that Rachel was hearing when she first turned on her cochlear implant. The production company Q Department came in on the back end to spatialize the sound design so the sound would adjust as you moved your head in the headset.  When Rachel got that playlist from her friends, she was trying to do something she hadn’t done before: hear music. In working on this piece, we were trying to do some things we hadn’t done before. We were trying to create a VR piece that was animated, that incorporated new 6DoF technologies and that told Rachel’s story with the depth and sensitivity it deserved. In the VR department, our jobs are the most exciting when we can use a new technology to shine a light on an important story.

Over the past 115 years global average temperatures have increased 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit, leading to record-breaking weather events and temperature extremes, the report says. The global, long-term warming trend is “unambiguous,” it says, and there is “no convincing alternative explanation” that anything other than humans — the cars we drive, the power plants we operate, the forests we destroy — are to blame.

1429,3049,11,3,2017,2017-11-03,The New York Times,Your Race Against Time: How Climate Affects the Marathon,"The interactions between climate and a sport like long-distance running are only going to get more pronounced as the climate changes. Over the last 50 years, the temperature has exceeded 60 degrees on just 5 percent of the days during the first week of November, when the New York race is typically held. By 2050, this is projected to rise to 18 percent of days, and by 2090 it is expected to be 38 percent.  How will runners and organizers react? National governments, city planners and large corporations are all realizing that a warmer world will force them to change the ways they do business.  Marathons will be no exception. The organizers of the New York race will probably not want their event to be one where it is difficult, or perhaps even impossible, for people to set their personal best or to lower the world record. So they may want to adapt by moving the marathon to later in the year.  At the same time, runners may switch from the New York City Marathon to others held in cooler climates to find the perfect temperature at just the right time of year. Could a Montreal Marathon be among the world’s most prestigious by 2050?  Athletic equipment companies will surely develop new technologies to aid adaptation as well. For runners, the breathable mesh and cooling towels of today could easily be traded in for shirts with built-in air-conditioners. Seem far-fetched? They already exist. Indeed, I was one of the authors of a recent study of just how powerful a role technology can play in helping people adapt to warmer temperatures. For example, the rise of air-conditioning has reduced the mortality consequences of extremely hot days in the United States by more than 70 percent since 1960.  Marathons and marathon runners appear likely to be able to adapt to climate change with relative ease through changes in when, where and how. But in many other areas of our lives, the costs of climate change are expected to be greater. More intense hurricanes, and the increased occurrence of extremely hot days, will elevate risks to life and property, which can only be offset through costly adaptation efforts. These include building more expensive housing, accelerating the deployment of air-conditioning and making painful decisions to move away from current homes — as well as acceptance of increased risks.  In this way, the climate choice in front of us is similar to the one faced by people training for a marathon. More time spent training makes for a faster marathon. It’s not a great idea to show up on the day of the race without having invested much in your performance. The time for that is well in advance of the big day.  In the case of climate change, we can devote resources now to reducing greenhouse gas emissions so that we face lower costs in the future. As with so many things in life, both marathons and the climate problem are subject to an old rule — no pain, no gain.",3.5,4,"[4.0, 1.5, 5.0, 3.5]"

Between school supplies and summer camps, sports and doctor’s visits, raising children increasingly takes more and more money. I should know — my wife, Jeanette, and I have four. We’ve been blessed in recent years, but I know what it’s like to start a family and struggle to make ends meet. My parents were immigrants who came to America with virtually nothing, and after I finished law school, I owed more than $100,000 in student loans.  There’s a reason many people feel it’s harder to afford children now than in previous generations. It’s true. According to federal data adjusted for inflation, from 1960 to 2015 the average annual cost of raising a child in a middle-income family rose by over $11,000. It’s now estimated that middle-class parents will spend more than $230,000 over the course of their son or daughter’s childhood — and that doesn’t even include college tuition.  Ask just about any couple and they’ll tell you this absolutely influences their decisions about when to have children and how many to have. As the economist Lyman Stone has shown, by 2012, the average number of children American women intended to have was 2.37, and the total fertility rate was 1.88 — a gap of about 0.5 children on average. Since the 1960s, there has been a consistent gap between intended and total fertility, even as the number of children American women desire to have and the total birthrate have declined over time.  There are many causes for this gap, but the increasing cost of childbearing clearly has played a role in its development. For example, think of families who delayed having children for a few years until they were more financially stable and may not have been able to have as many as they initially wanted. Or parents who wanted more children, but after their first or second realized they couldn’t afford the combined cost of taking care of the child and reducing their work hours. The German economist Anna Raute has isolated this “opportunity cost” of childbearing as a significant factor in fertility decisions.",2.5,3,"[0.5, 2.5, 4.5]"

The second, he said, was the Lautenberg Amendment.  “The real story is why, with these offenses, was he still able to buy a gun?” Mr. Christensen said. “He clearly should not have been able to.”  He noted that the military justice system uses different terminology than civilian criminal courts, which could explain why Mr. Kelley’s conviction was not reported. “That could be part of the problem here, our use of archaic terms that don’t translate well to the civilian world,” he said.  When Congress adopted the Lautenberg Amendment in 1996, the nation was in the mood to enact gun safety laws, said Richard Aborn, a longtime advocate for gun safety and the former president of the Brady Center, which advocates gun control. Lawmakers had already adopted a ban on military-style assault weapons — that law has since lapsed — and prohibited the purchase of large-capacity ammunition magazines.  But the Gun Control Act of 1968, which regulated the purchase of firearms, stipulated that only convicted felons could be prohibited from buying guns. “The question kept coming up, what about domestic violence, because its often a misdemeanor, and we knew that there was a linkage between gun violence and domestic violence,” Mr. Aborn said. “That was the birth of the whole conversation.”  But the law’s definition of who is a domestic abuser is “quite specific,” said Mr. Rosen, of the Everytown group. The measure requires, for example, that the victim and the abuser have to have been married or have had a child together, or have lived together. Thus the Lautenberg Amendment does not apply to people who are dating, which gives rise to what advocates call “the boyfriend loophole.”  Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, has introduced legislation that would close that loophole, and would also prevent stalkers from having guns. A 2014 report by the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress reviewed conviction records in 20 states, and found that nearly 12,000 people across the country had been convicted of misdemeanor-level stalking, but were still permitted to own guns.  “The Lautenberg Amendment was bare bones,” said Kim Gandy, the chief executive of the National Network to End Domestic Violence. “There are a lot of gaps in the instant criminal background check system; the data is only as good as what goes into it.

They were given access to special social work resources. There was even a staff engagement adviser whose specific duty was providing close monitoring and feedback, and who would remind patients about the importance of adherence.  This was a kitchen-sink approach. It involved direct financial incentives, social support nudges, health care system resources and significant clinical management. It failed.  The time to first hospitalization for a cardiovascular problem or death was the same between the two groups. The time to any hospitalization and the total number of hospitalizations were the same. So were the medical costs. Even medication adherence — the process measure that might influence these outcomes — was no different between the two groups.  The researchers in this trial deserve praise for their frank assessment of their results, as well as for trying to brainstorm ways in which they might achieve success in the future. Getting patients to change their behavior is very hard. In the past, we’ve tried making drugs free to patients to get them to adhere to their medications and improve outcomes. That failed. We’ve tried lotteries (as in the study above) to nudge people to achieve better compliance. That failed.  Maybe financial incentives, and behavioral economics in general, work better in public health than in more direct health care. There have been successes, after all, with respect to weight loss — although these seemed to disappear over time. We’ve also seen promise with respect to smoking cessation, although these come with caveats as well.  Experts caution that the interventions that achieve success are often very intensive. They demand a great deal of attention, and can be quite expensive. Moreover, they are very focused, usually on a single issue or condition.  The problem is that health has so many moving parts. The health care system has even more. Trying to improve any one aspect can make others worse.

They devote their professional lives to rescuing patients having heart attacks and bringing them back from the brink.  End-of-life care is not typically their focus; neither do they spend much time pondering what some of their patients may experience in the future. “Those who go into cardiology are not necessarily ones who want to deal with death and dying,” Dr. Bristow said.  The very nature of end-stage heart failure makes it all the more difficult to prepare.  “Very few patients understand the trajectory of the disease,” said Dr. Lynne Warner Stevenson, a heart failure specialist at Vanderbilt University. The path has peaks and valleys, but as the patient declines, each peak is a little lower than the one before.  And often doctors do not tell patients what to expect.  “Unfortunately, when you have patients with a chronic illness like heart failure, everyone thinks someone else will talk about it,” Dr. Stevenson said. “Too often, no one takes ownership of the last stage of the journey with the patient.”  Dr. Ellen Hummel of the University of Michigan, one of a small number of doctors specializing in cardiology palliative care, said the typical patient with cancer will usually experience a “fairly predictable” decline.  “They will be less able to take care of themselves,” she said. “They will be more symptomatic and come back to the hospital more frequently.

It is hard to talk to a 17-year-old about what their knee will be like in 20 years.”  Although Lalli, the former soccer player, said his arthritis diagnosis was a shock, he also said that knowing that it might happen would not have made much difference. He might have a genetic predisposition toward knee arthritis. His father took up soccer in his late 40s and had to have surgery at 50 when he tore the A.C.L. in his left knee.

The Wind Catcher farm in Oklahoma occupies 2,400 times as much land as Diablo Canyon but produces half as much energy.  The most worrisome aspect about the all-out push for a future powered by renewables has to do with cost: The price of turbines and solar panels may be falling, but the cost of integrating these intermittent sources of energy — on when the wind blows and the sun shines; off when they don’t — is not. This alone will sharply curtail the climate benefits of renewable power.  Integrating renewable sources requires vast investments in electricity transmission — to move power from intermittently windy and sunny places to places where power is consumed. It requires maintaining a backstop of idle plants that burn fossil fuel, for the times when there is no wind or sun to be had. It requires investing in power-storage systems at a large scale.  These costs will ultimately be reflected in power prices. One concern is that by raising the retail cost of electricity they will discourage electrification, encouraging consumers to rely on alternative energy sources like gas — and pushing CO 2 emissions up.  Another concern is that they will drive wholesale energy prices down too far. Because they produce the most energy when the sun is up and the wind is blowing, renewable generators can flood the grid at critical times of the day, slashing the price of power. This not only threatens the solvency of nuclear reactors, which cannot shut down on a dime and must therefore pay for the grid to accept their power, but also reduces the return on additional investment in renewables.  A study by Lion Hirth of the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin found that the value of wind power falls from 110 percent of the average power price to 50 to 80 percent as the penetration of wind rises from zero to 30 percent of total consumption. “Competitive large-scale renewables deployment will be more difficult to accomplish than many anticipate,” he concluded.  The diplomats in Bonn may be tempted to wave away these concerns. Thomas Bruckner of the University of Leipzig argues that in the case of Germany, expanding renewables to supply 80 percent of power by 2050 is “not a significant burden.” Heavy German investment in renewable energy technologies over the last decade succeeded in bringing prices down, he contends; it will be much cheaper to go the rest of the way.",2.8333333333333335,6,"[4.0, 1.0, 5.0, 0.5, 3.0, 3.5]"

In 2012, he had escaped from a mental hospital in New Mexico to which he had been sent after assaulting his wife and fracturing his stepson’s skull.  A video of the church killing reportedly shows Mr. Kelley working his way methodically through the aisles, shooting some parishioners, even children, at point-blank range.  “I think that mental health is your problem here,” President Trump told reporters on Monday.  It is true that severe mental illnesses are found more often among mass murderers. About one in five are likely psychotic or delusional, according to Dr. Michael Stone, a forensic psychiatrist at Columbia University who maintains a database of 350 mass killers going back more than a century.

The drugmaker AbbVie has won multiple approvals for rare-disease uses for Humira, the world’s best-selling drug, ranging from a form of juvenile arthritis to an eye disease, uveitis. Many new cancer approvals also receive orphan-drug designation because they are targeted at a narrow slice of the population.  With the coveted exclusivity granted by their orphan-drug status, companies can charge virtually anything they want for these products, and some manufacturers have set astronomical prices for drugs that have gone on to bring in billions in sales. Soliris, made by Alexion, racked up more than $2.8 billion in sales in 2016 even though it is only approved to treat three rare diseases.  In May, three Republican senators, including Senator Hatch, asked the Government Accountability Office to look into possible abuses of the Orphan Drug Act, prompted by an investigation by Kaiser Health News. Mr. Melmeyer said he did not think the request showed a change of heart by Senator Hatch, who is chairman of the Finance Committee that may release its tax plan as early as Thursday.  “We’re very much counting on him to step up and be the champion on this,” Mr. Melmeyer said.  In 2015, a report commissioned by the biotechnology trade group and NORD estimated that if the tax credit were removed, the number of drugs approved over the next decade would decline by 33 percent.  Eric Davis, the executive vice president and general counsel of BioMarin Pharmaceutical, which develops what it describes as “ultrarare” drugs, said the tax credit “is really critical to helping us get over the hump with our investment decisions, and I think that’s true for a lot of companies in our space.”  Philip English, a former Republican Congressman who now lobbies for drug firms, said he believed that his clients were picking up support from Republicans and said he was confident that the tax credit would survive any Senate plan.  “I think there is a consensus within the industry and within the advocacy community that the orphan drug credit has been immensely successful in generating innovative investment that has produced a string of successes,” Mr. English said.",4.0,3,"[3.5, 4.0, 4.5]"

Policymakers largely brushed aside the opinions of two of the bloc’s science agencies, which had found that glyphosate was not a carcinogen.  But glyphosate, which accounts for about a quarter of the global market, has been plunged into controversy since the International Agency for Research on Cancer, part of the World Health Organization, declared it a probable carcinogen in 2015. The finding, which has been disputed by a number of other government agencies, has made the weedkiller a magnet for controversy.  Glyphosate is also at the center of a federal case in the United States over claims that it causes cancer, and California has declared it a carcinogen, following in the footsteps of the international cancer agency.  Use of glyphosate has soared in the United States and other parts of the world over the last two decades, after Monsanto introduced crops that were genetically engineered to be resistant to the chemical. That meant key crops like corn, soybeans and cotton could be sprayed with the herbicide after they emerged from the ground. During that time, the presence of glyphosate in human urine increased 500 percent, according to a recent study by the University of California San Diego School of Medicine and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.  Europe, by contrast, has largely shunned genetically modified crops, but glyphosate is still the Continent’s biggest seller. In Britain and Germany, it is used on as much as 40 percent of agricultural land, according to an industry trade group.  But political sentiment in Europe has been turning against Monsanto, the American company that has become the face of the agrochemical industry, even though it is in the process of being acquired by Bayer, a German chemicals giant. The European Parliament voted last month to ban glyphosate, a step that was nonbinding. And in September, the Parliament made Monsanto the first company to be barred from lobbying the chamber.  The science around glyphosate has become a muddle of allegations and counterallegations. Environmental activists have accused national regulators of hewing too closely to Monsanto’s wishes, while the industry has been exasperated that European politicians are overruling their science agencies. The litigation in the United States has only muddied the waters further, with evidence emerging that Monsanto ghostwrote both journalism and academic work, eroding trust in a company that had long been a lightning rod.",3.75,4,"[3.0, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5]"

But it got to the point where she couldn’t take a shower for fear he would stray out of the house.  So 18 months ago, she moved him to a memory care community near their home in Scottsdale, Az., which like most long-term care, is not covered by Medicare. That, plus his other medical expenses, cost the couple $90,000 last year.  “These expenses place a huge burden on your retirement savings,” said Mrs. Hollack, whose husband, Harry, managed operations for semiconductor companies. “Losing that tax deduction becomes a double burden.”  The Republican tax overhaul bill introduced in the House last week would eliminate that deduction, which allows people who itemize their federal income taxes to deduct medical expenses that exceed 10 percent of their total income. The change is part of a broad effort to rewrite the tax code in a way that Republicans say will be simpler and fairer. But while the party has framed its tax plan as a boon for the middle class, eliminating the medical-expense deduction would hit the middle class squarely, eliminating a source of relief that has helped millions of people cope with steep medical costs in a country without comprehensive, universal health coverage.",3.0,2,"[4.0, 2.0]"

Another senior adviser was given a top position there before moving over to the White House. And Marc Short, the White House’s legislative director, is a former top Koch lieutenant.  The latest push was a natural fit to activate other Koch groups, including Americans for Prosperity and Freedom Partners, according to a representative of the network, who asked for anonymity to discuss the group’s plans. The network plans to spend liberally from its $300 million to $400 million policy and politics budget for the year, financing outreach to activists, lobbying and direct advertising.  Other allied groups, including Grover Norquist’s Americans for Tax Reform and Tea Party Nation, have come along, signing a letter to lawmakers late last month amplifying many of Concerned Veterans’ long-running arguments.  That campaign has disturbed many of the old-line veterans groups, which argue that their privileged place in advising lawmakers is protected for a reason. Concerned Veterans and other advocacy groups working alongside it take directions from wealthy donors, they say, not veterans.  The old-line veterans groups and lawmakers from both parties supported the creation of the Choice program and largely agree that the agency’s health programs need reorganization. The House committee was set to vote on bipartisan legislation on Wednesday that would allow agency doctors to decide with the veteran when it was in a veteran’s best interest to seek private care — because a nearby government facility either was overburdened or could not provide specialty care.  The vote was ultimately postponed over cost concerns.  Republicans and conservative groups would prefer new spending be at least partly offset by cost savings and other cuts to the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Trump administration officials said that the leaders’ exchanges had had a harder edge behind the scenes. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson told reporters that Mr. Trump had, in effect, used flattery to appeal to Mr. Xi to do more to isolate North Korea.  “Our president has been very clear with President Xi that he takes the view that, ‘You are a very powerful neighbor of theirs, you account for 90-plus percent of their economic activity, you’re a strong man,’” Mr. Tillerson said, channeling Mr. Trump. “‘You can, I’m sure, solve this for me.’”  Mr. Tillerson dismissed Mr. Trump’s contention that trade deficits were America’s fault as “a little bit of tongue in cheek” in the midst of a much tougher discussion. During their meeting, he said, Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, ticked off the long history of trade imbalances, and warned they could not be allowed to continue.  The one tangible gain from Mr. Trump’s trip — $250 billion worth of business agreements between American and Chinese companies — was viewed as a token of Chinese good will. Many of the deals are preliminary and will take years to come to fruition. They broke no new ground in areas, like technology, where the United States is losing market access.

The House version eliminated a lot of things, and the Senate version restored some of them. But as Republican legislators shape a bill that delivers a big cut in corporate taxes while remaining within deficit limits that allow a party-line vote, the houses have consistently looked at reducing credits and deductions whose ripple effects would be minimal in most of the country but profound for taxpayers who live, generally, in Democratic states.  For instance, both the House and Senate bills either reduce or repeal the deduction for state income, sales and property taxes. California’s top personal income-tax rate is the nation’s highest.  The House bill lowered the limit on the mortgage-interest deduction for new home purchases from $1 million in debt to $500,000. That move would affect fewer than 3 percent of mortgage holders nationally, and there are only four metropolitan areas in the United States where more than half of the homes are priced above $500,000. All four are in California. (The Senate bill keeps the limit at $1 million.)  Also, no state benefits more from itemized deductions, which the bills limit, and in many cases discourage, by increasing the standard deduction. Economic models suggest that the bulk of the millions of families that would face tax increases under the legislation itemize their deductions.  More than a third of Californians itemize their deductions, according to data compiled by the Pew Charitable Trusts; the average benefit from those deductions was nearly $37,000 in 2015.  California is not the only state whose voters would lose deductions from the tax bill.

But poorly educated women often think it is not worth the trouble to visit a clinic before they are in labor. Many believe that consulting traditional healers is just as worthwhile.

But before they can do any of that, they need to agree to formal ground rules for that exercise. That “rule book” will be a focus at Bonn.  How do countries plan to make progress on climate change?  One widely recognized problem with the current Paris pledges is that they’re fairly vague.  China promised that its emissions would peak around 2030, but the country’s energy data is notoriously murky, so it’s hard to tell how much progress it’s actually making. Similarly, the European Union vowed to cut emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, but offered few specifics on how to achieve that goal — making it hard to gauge whether European policymakers could realistically be doing much more.  At Bonn, negotiators will be discussing how to make these pledges more rigorous and transparent, so that countries can more readily be held accountable for their actions. That means tackling questions like: What’s the best way to track nations’ progress, to see if they’re doing what they said they would do? Is there a way to tell if a country’s pledge could be made more ambitious? Which specific policies are working well and which aren’t?  Because the Paris pledges are largely voluntary — world leaders would have never agreed to a deal otherwise — no one can force governments to take additional action. But, the idea goes, if pledges and policies are made more transparent, world leaders will be better able to pressure and help each other to do more.  The final draft of this “rule book” is not due until next year, and it may not actually get finished at Bonn, but negotiators are hoping to make significant progress on a long list of items at these talks. As always, diplomacy tends to proceed fitfully.  What role will the U.S. play?

Of course, unlike the salesmen in that movie, the Liveops agents can’t really be fired — the third prize — because they weren’t employees to begin with.  A while later, Mr. Carter described a recent initiative in which agents were promised a bonus if 95 percent of their collective sales were paid up front. “I knew it wasn’t going to work as soon as they said it,” he told me, because a handful of agents with low paid rates could ruin everyone else’s chances.  “They did do a pullover sweatshirt for the top two,” he added, brightening. “I was second, so that’s coming.”",1.5,1,[1.5]

In September, the department released an outline of a “new direction” for the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, set up by the Affordable Care Act to test models aimed at improving medical care and reducing costs. While the Obama administration had pushed large, mandatory experiments to test new models of pay, the Trump administration wants to encourage smaller, voluntary programs — and has asked the doctors to help design them.    “Clearly a great big foot has been put on the brake,” said Donald Crane, the chief executive of CAPG, a group of doctors and hospital administrators that, unlike many in the profession, has pushed to tie physician pay to quality measures rather than the old model of fee for service.  Mr. Crane was referring specifically to the scaling back of the cardiac and joint replacement programs by Tom Price, an orthopedic surgeon and Republican former congressman chosen by Mr. Trump as secretary of health and human services. Mr. Price, who resigned in September over his use of expensive private jets, had accused the Obama administration of trying to “commandeer clinical decision-making” by forcing doctors to participate in experiments that test new ways of paying for care.

Economists at Goldman Sachs said last month that they expect tax cuts to generate enough additional growth to offset about a fifth of their revenue losses. That means $1 trillion of net tax cuts would lose $800 billion on a dynamic basis.  Dynamic scoring is inexact in the best of circumstances. Under the compressed congressional schedule this fall, it is even more difficult, said Alan J. Auerbach, a University of California, Berkeley, economist who is widely considered a godfather of modern dynamic scoring models.  As a result, only a few models have churned out consistent dynamic analyses that attempt to account for all the provisions of the House and Senate bills. The Tax Foundation has one. Mr. Smetters and his Penn Wharton team have another. Perhaps the most important scorekeeper on that front, the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, is due to weigh in this week, with an analysis of the bill pending in the House.  Ironically, the models that so far have produced the least optimistic forecasts for the Republican plan are the ones that most closely track the assumptions conservatives have long espoused about the economy: that racking up deficits and debt will hold back growth.  That is the case with the Penn Wharton model, which finds that the House bill would lose between $1 trillion and $1.7 trillion over a decade in revenue, after accounting for growth, depending on various assumptions about the flow of investment dollars in the global economy and the growth-stoking power of tax cuts. The Tax Foundation’s more optimistic model projects the Senate bill would lose $500 billion in revenue after growth effects.  Other economists have produced optimistic effects based on approximations of a bill Congress might eventually agree upon. On Friday, Douglas Holtz-Eakin and Gordon Gray of the conservative American Action Forum released an analysis that attempts to mirror the joint committee’s methodology, but that models a bill with smaller net tax cuts than in the Republican plans. It found such a plan could cost as little as $310 billion over a decade.  The one model so far to suggest that the bills could fully pay for themselves comes from a Boston University economist, Laurence J. Kotlikoff, who employs what he calls a more comprehensive view of the global economy’s dynamics than other economists do. Mr. Kotlikoff’s analysis finds large growth effects from the House and Senate’s plans to cut top corporate tax rates to 20 percent from 35 percent today. It makes some growth-boosting assumptions that differ from the bills as drafted, and it essentially excludes the impacts of personal income tax changes on the economy; other models find those changes would affect growth and revenue.",5.0,1,[5.0]
