1087,2665,10,28,2017,2017-10-28,Fox News,Mattis: US will not accept a nuclear North Korea,"U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis issued a stern warning to North Korea on Saturday: Despite its ongoing missile and nuclear programs, it is simply no match for the U.S.-South Korea alliance.  “Make no mistake,” Mattis said during a news conference in Seoul, “any attack on the United States or our allies will be defeated, and any use of nuclear weapons by the North will be met with a massive military response that is effective and overwhelming.”  During the joint appearance with South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo, Mattis acknowledged that the threat of a nuclear missile attack by North Korea was accelerating.  The CIA says North Korea could be just months away from being capable of hitting the U.S. with a nuclear strike, Reuters reported.  Mattis accused the regime of Kim Jong Un of illegal and unnecessary missile and nuclear programs -- and vowed to defeat any attack.  He said the North engages in ""outlaw"" behavior and that the U.S. would never accept a nuclear North. He added that regardless of what the North might try, it is overmatched by the firepower and cohesiveness of the decades-old U.S.-South Korean alliance.  “North Korea has accelerated the threat that it poses to its neighbors and the world through its illegal and unnecessary missile and nuclear weapons programs,"" Mattis said, adding that U.S.-South Korean military and diplomatic collaboration thus has taken on ""a new urgency.""  “I cannot imagine a condition under which the United States would accept North Korea as a nuclear power,"" he said.  ""I cannot imagine a condition under which the United States would accept North Korea as a nuclear power."" — U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis  As he emphasized throughout his weeklong Asia trip – which comes ahead of President Donald Trump’s own scheduled tour of East Asia next week -- Mattis said diplomacy remains the preferred way to deal with the North.  Mattis's comments in Seoul did not go beyond his recent statements of concern about North Korea, although he appeared to inject a stronger note about the urgency of resolving the crisis.  While he accused the North of ""outlaw"" behavior, he did not mention that President Donald Trump has ratcheted up his own rhetoric. In August, Trump warned the North not to make any more threats against the United States, and said that if it did, it would be met with ""fire and fury like the world has never seen.""  Limits would be lifted  Song, the South Korean minister, told the news conference that he and Mattis agreed that limits on South Korea conventional missile warhead payloads would be lifted. He offered no specifics.  Also discussed were the conditions under which South Korea would be given wartime operational control of its forces. Currently, if war with the North broke out, the South's forces would operate under the U.S.-led U.N. Command.  Trump entered office declaring his commitment to solving the North Korea problem, asserting that he would succeed where his predecessors had failed. His administration has sought to increase pressure on Pyongyang through U.N. Security Council sanctions and other diplomatic efforts, but the North hasn't budged from its goal of building a full-fledged nuclear arsenal, including missiles capable of striking the U.S. mainland.  If Trump sticks to his pledge to stop the North from being able to threaten the U.S. with a nuclear attack, something will have to give - either a negotiated tempering of the North's ambitions or a U.S. acceptance of the North as a nuclear power.  The other alternative would be U.S. military action to attempt to neutralize or eliminate the North's nuclear assets - a move fraught with risk for South Korea, Japan and the United States.  At his Seoul news conference, Mattis said the North is, in effect, shooting itself in the foot.  “If it remains on its current path of ballistic missiles and atomic bombs, it will be counterproductive, in effect reducing its security,"" he said.  The North says it needs nuclear weapons to counter what it believes is a U.S. effort to strangle its economy and overthrow the Kim government.  Second visit to region  This was Mattis's second visit to South Korea since taking office in January. He made a point of going to Seoul and Tokyo on his first overseas trip in February, saying he wanted to emphasis the importance he places on strengthening alliances and partnerships.  On Friday he visited the Demilitarized Zone that forms an official buffer between the two Koreas. He appeared there with Song in what they both called a show of solidarity.  U.S. government officials for decades have confidently but mistakenly predicted the approaching collapse of North Korea, given its economic and political isolation.  Twenty years ago, Mattis's predecessor five times removed, William Cohen, said as he peered into North Korea from inside the DMZ that its communist system was ""decaying and dying."" His view was widely shared in Washington, but, like others, he underestimated the resilience of Pyongyang's family dynasty, which began with Kim Il Sung.  The current ruler assumed control of the country shortly after his father, Kim Jong-Il, died in December 2011, and has accelerated the country's nuclear and missile programs.

1272,2871,11,2,2017,2017-11-02,Vox,Here’s what Trump’s opioid commission wants him to do,"If President Donald Trump is serious about dealing with the opioid epidemic, we now have an official checklist by which to judge his administration’s actions.  On Wednesday, Trump’s opioid commission, led by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, put out its long-awaited recommendations to deal with the nation’s drug overdose crisis — just days after Trump declared a public health emergency over the epidemic, which contributed to the US’s record 64,000 drug overdose deaths in 2016.  The list includes more than 50 recommendations, touching on a variety of federal, state, and local agencies. They include streamlining federal money for drug addiction, knocking down barriers to treatment, expanding federal drug courts, and implementing new training requirements for doctors who prescribe opioid painkillers.  The commission does not say how much funding implementing its recommendations or tackling the opioid crisis will require — leaving a huge question open, even as it argues that “Congress must act” and “appropriate sufficient funds to implement the Commission’s recommendations.” It also does not call for a new, large investment into drug addiction treatment, as some advocates hoped for.  With its final report, the commission ends months of work in which it met with major stakeholders involved in the crisis, from people struggling with addiction to insurers to pharmaceutical companies.  The question now is whether Trump and Congress will listen to the recommendations.  What Trump’s commission recommends  Here are some of the biggest recommendations in the report:  Streamline federal funding for drug addiction: According to the report, nearly every governor’s office complained about the “fragmented” state of federal funding for opioids and addiction. The report recommends streamlining the current process into a block grant, which should require “one application and one set of reporting requirements” for funding. The commission argues this would let states focus less on paperwork and more on actually implementing policies.

The commission argues this would let states focus less on paperwork and more on actually implementing policies. Remove barriers to treatment: The report proposes a number of moves for federal agencies to remove barriers to addiction treatment, including better enforcement of parity laws that in theory require insurers to pay for such care. But it stops short of calling for a new, large federal investment into treatment. This is needed: According to a 2016 report by the surgeon general, only 10 percent of Americans with drug use disorders get specialty treatment — in large part because they often can’t afford such services and, even if they can, can face waiting periods of weeks or even months to get in.

Open drug courts in all federal jurisdictions: Drug courts, which divert people from prison to addiction treatment, were up and running in less than 30 percent of federal districts in 2015, according to the report. The commission said this should be 100 percent. The argument for this is harm reduction: Drug courts can make sure that people who need treatment get that instead of prison time. But drug courts have been criticized for frequently ignoring evidence-based treatment options, including anti-addiction medications like methadone and buprenorphine, which are considered the gold standard for treating opioid addiction.

More opioid prescriber training: The commission asks that the Department of Health and Human Services develop “a national curriculum and standard of care for opioid prescribers.” It also proposes that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) require doctors renewing their opioid prescribing licenses to attend an education program for such prescriptions.

Stop evaluating doctors based on pain scores: One of the reasons for the rise in the prescription of opioids is doctors were commonly evaluated in government-mandated surveys based on how well they treated a patient’s self-reported pain. This encouraged doctors to prescribe opioids that could lead to short-term improvements in pain but, in the long term, lead to addiction, overdose, and other problems. To end this perverse incentive, the commission asks that patient satisfaction surveys used to evaluate doctors no longer include any questions about pain.

To end this perverse incentive, the commission asks that patient satisfaction surveys used to evaluate doctors no longer include any questions about pain. Allow more emergency responders to deploy naloxone: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration currently puts out a best-practices guide that suggests certain emergency responders carry naloxone, an opioid overdose antidote. The commission wants that guide to include all emergency medical staff, which some states currently don’t allow. But the report’s recommendation doesn’t extend to opening access to naloxone beyond that — which some advocates would like to see.

Tougher prison sentences for fentanyl : The commission calls for “the enhancement of federal sentencing penalties for the trafficking of fentanyl [a potent synthetic opioid] and fentanyl analogues.” The empirical evidence shows this will have little to no effect on drug use, but it’s a very popular idea within the law enforcement community.

A media campaign: The report recommends a federally funded media campaign on addiction stigma and the dangers of opioids. This is one of Trump’s favorite ideas, which he has repeatedly invoked. The research, however, shows these campaigns often fail — or, worse, actually lead to more drug use by making drugs an attractive sign of rebellion or triggering curiosity about drugs that kids or teens previously didn’t know existed.  This is only a summary of some of the key recommendations, giving an idea of the many issues the commission tried to address. And they come on top of the commission’s previous recommendations. For all 56 proposals, read the full report.  So far, the reaction to the commission’s report by activists and experts is mixed. Baltimore City Health Commissioner Leana Wen, a major advocate on the opioid crisis, summed up much of the sentiment in a statement: “While the final report issued today by the President’s Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis addresses critical aspects of the fight against the nation’s opioid epidemic, it does not go nearly far enough.”  It’s on Trump and Congress now  The question now is whether Trump and Congress will actually follow through on the recommendations. Trump, after all, took months to act on one of the proposals in the commission’s preliminary report issued in July — and he left many of the other early recommendations, at least so far, untouched.  Politically, this is a very important issue for Trump. A post-election analysis by historian Kathleen Frydl found, for example, that most of the Ohio and Pennsylvania counties that flipped from former President Barack Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016 had very high drug overdose death rates.  The opioid epidemic goes back to the 1990s, with the release of OxyContin and mass marketing of prescription painkillers, as well as campaigns like “Pain as the Fifth Vital Sign” that pushed doctors to treat pain as a serious medical problem. This contributed to the spread of opioid painkiller misuse and addiction, which over time also led to greater use of illicitly produced opioids like heroin and fentanyl. Drug overdose deaths have climbed every year since the late ’90s as a result.  The issue has really turned into two simultaneous crises — which Keith Humphreys, a Stanford University drug policy expert, has described as the dual problems of “stock” and “flow.” On one hand, you have the current stock of opioid users who are addicted; the people in this population need treatment or they will simply find other, potentially deadlier opioids to use if they lose access to prescribed painkillers. On the other hand, you have to stop new generations of potential drug users from accessing and misusing opioids.  Addressing these crises will, experts say, require tens of billions of federal dollars. As I previously explained, we have a pretty good idea of what those resources should go to: They could be used to boost access to treatment, pull back lax access to opioid painkillers while keeping them accessible to patients who truly need them, and adopt harm reduction policies that mitigate the damage caused by opioids and other drugs.  Some states are attempting to confront this issue. Vermont, for example, has built a “hub and spoke” system that treats addiction as a public health issue and integrates treatment into the health care system. Potentially as a result, the state was the only one in New England to have a drug overdose death rate below the national average in 2015. (For more, check out our in-depth breakdown of Vermont’s system.)  But Vermont managed to build this new system in large part with federal dollars, particularly through Obamacare’s insurance expansion and a special Medicaid waiver that states can obtain through the health care law. It’s that kind of federal support that budget-strained states will need to deal with the opioid crisis — yet it’s unclear, even after this report, what Trump and Congress will do to make that federal support available to more states.",9.0,8.0
613,2009,8,23,2017,2017-08-23,Vox,Why Buddhism is true,"Robert Wright, the best-selling author of The Moral Animal and The Evolution of God, has written a new book titled Why Buddhism is True. Don’t be put off by the audacious title, though.  Wright isn’t proselytizing or implying that other religions are false. This is, instead, a light, accessible guide for anyone interested in the practical benefits of meditation. There are no analyses of Buddhist beliefs about reincarnation or supernatural deities; the focus is on what Wright calls Western Buddhism or secular Buddhism, which is less about belief and more about meditation as a therapeutic practice.  By “true” Wright means that Buddhism’s “diagnosis of the human predicament is fundamentally correct, and that its prescription is deeply valid and urgently important.” That diagnosis goes something like this: the human condition is defined by constant and ultimately inexplicable suffering. Meditation isn’t a way out of this suffering. But it helps us transcend it by teaching us to see it clearly for what it is, and by making us more attuned to our emotive impulses and the behaviors they produce.  I sat down with Wright at the Vox office in Washington, D.C. We talked about the illusion of self, the psychology of tribalism, how meditation can make us more moral, and why he thinks spreading meditation practice could be socially transformative.  “One of the things that’s most lacking in the world is not emotional empathy, it’s cognitive empathy,” he told me, “meaning we have trouble seeing things from the point of view of other people ... That is more urgently needed than emotional empathy.”  Wright believes meditation, if not quite a solution to this problem, is at least a corrective. By training us to focus our attention on the present moment, to the breath and the body, we can start to see most of our thoughts as petty and our emotions as fleeting. Through this practice, the self starts to dissolve and we can be more aware of other people, and build something like a broader consciousness.  Part of the problem is that our busy minds distract us from immediate experience; we’re too absorbed in our thoughts to be truly present. We’re also stuck with brains that evolved under very different circumstances than we confront today.  We’re hard-wired to pursue pleasure, and that leaves us perpetually unsatisfied. What we have is never quite enough, and so our attention is always directed at the future, at what we think we want. ""We're not designed by natural selection to be happy,"" Wright says.  Meditation isn’t the only path to peace, but it might be the simplest and best one.  You can read a lightly edited transcript of our conversation below or click on the link to listen to it in full.  Sean Illing  So your book has a slightly obnoxious title. It’s going to strike a lot of people as implying that Buddhism is true and therefore other religions are false. Is that fair?  Robert Wright  It does sound like I'm coming down from the mountaintop with this revealed truth and I'm going to kindly take some time to share it with mortals. But as for the other religions problem, I'm only talking about what you could call the naturalistic parts of Buddhism, so I'm not talking about reincarnation, the supernatural stuff. I'm talking about the claims that you might say are made by Buddhist psychology and philosophy.  There's no real contradiction between this and any religions. The Dalai Lama doesn’t use Buddhism necessarily. Remember, Buddhist use it to become a better whatever you are. I think if you're talking about Buddhism in larger sense to include the supernatural stuff, I'm not sure that you can defend that claim but I think if you're just talking about what is sometimes called, misleadingly I think, the secular part of Buddhism or the naturalistic part, there's no reason for anyone to feel threatened by me.  Sean Illing  What do you mean by “naturalistic”?  Robert Wright  The part of Buddhism that I’m defending is the claim that the reason we suffer is because we don’t see the world clearly, and that that’s also the reason we make other people suffer. In other words, it's the reason we’re often not happy and it's the reason we're often not good is that we are subject to illusions about ourselves, about the world, and if we could only clarify our vision, then we’d be happier and better people.  It’s an amazing claim because the idea there is that you can kill three birds with one stone in principle, and Buddhism provides the stone. It provides a path of practice and, in some sense, education that according to Buddhism at least does help you see things more clearly, does make you happier, and does make you a better person.  I’m actually defending the idea, certainly that we, by our nature, tend not to see the world clearly in a lot of consequential respects, that that does often make us unhappy. It does often make us behave badly toward other people and in addition to buying this diagnosis of the human predicament, I think there’s quite a lot to be said for the prescription.  I myself have gotten fairly seriously into mindfulness meditation, and I practice it in the context of Buddhist philosophy. I’ve been on retreats, one week, two week retreats, a number of these, partly just to get a sense for what I would like to be like, a super committed meditator, which I’m not. I have a daily practice but I’m not one of these highly adept meditators.  Sean Illing  Well, let's dive into the meditation mindfulness part of this because your book starts with you recounting the experience of being at a retreat and feeling as though you finally woke up, like Neo in “The Matrix” taking the red pill. What happened? What was the experience like at that retreat, and how was it transformative for you?  Robert Wright  My first retreat was back in 2003, and I had never had any success in meditating. I have like a really limited attention span. I'm fidgety. I’m not a picture of emotional stability, I would say, so I was not a natural meditator. It had never really clicked. Somebody suggested I go to a retreat. I went to one week silent meditation retreat, which is very closely associated with mindfulness meditation, although they're not the same thing, and it was amazing. The first two days were hell. I couldn’t focus on my breaths for 10 consecutive breaths, but I eventually had pretty memorable experiences and beyond that, beyond the experiences I had meditating, which included some pretty powerful experiences, there was just an ongoing transformation of my consciousness.  So by the end of the week, I felt like I was a different person. I remember I called my wife after the retreat and before I had even said anything, when she just heard the tone of my voice, she said she liked the new me. It was.  Before I elaborate, I should issue the warning that these effects may not last forever if you go on a meditation retreat. It’s not that easy to sustain the frame of mind you're in, but I just had a hugely deepened appreciation of beauty. I’m normally not that aesthetically sensitive, I guess. I was much less judgmental of people. Before, it’s funny, before meditation before the retreat, you’re looking at people and you’re just sizing them up while you do. You're going like, ""Oh. Well, that’s an asshole. That’s an asshole. He looks okay."" It’s like, maybe not everyone does that anyway. I do that.  I have gotten enough of a taste of it that I can see the logic of how it works, how a daily practice can make you a little happier, a little better, and how in principle really intensive meditation could be transformative. Now, whether that could bring true full-fledged enlightenment is another question, where you are completely liberated from suffering and you have a completely clear view of the world and so on. That’s the Buddhist ideal, but certainly I think you can go a ways down that path, and I’m sure that I could go a lot further than I have if I had the time to commit to it.  Sean Illing  I have tried meditating regularly probably a half a dozen times, and I’m just completely inept at it. I just cannot do it with any regularity. I don’t think most people understand how difficult it is to sit still and pay attention to your moment-to-moment experience.  In the book, you talk about how we’re walking around with this outdated operating software for our brain that was designed or fitted for a very different kind of life circumstance that has almost nothing in common with present reality. This disjunction results in a lot of neuroses and pathologies and psychological disorders. So how does meditation ameliorate that or make our day-to-day mental life better?  Robert Wright  Let me first say that the problem is actually even worse than that. That is a problem that we're not living in the environment that we were designed for. We’re put in situations like I’ve got to give a talk tonight. I’m going to address a roomful of people I’ve never met. We weren’t designed to do that. There are a lot of things that cause anxiety that just we were not designed to do and that’s why they cause such anxiety. That said, when I say the problem is even worse than that, it's that we weren’t designed by natural selection to even be enduringly happy in the environment that we were designed for, like a hunter gatherer environment.  In fact, the two, as you've said, I've written about evolutionary psychology, I wrote a book called The Moral Animal a long time ago, and one thing I emphasize in that book is that we’re clearly not designed to be happy, and we’re not designed to see the world clearly. Natural selection just wants to get genes into the next generation. I say ""wants to"" and personifying natural selection, obviously it's not really a conscious process, but if you look at its priorities, it’s designing organisms that get genes into the next generation. If illusions will help them do that, then illusions there will be. If suffering will help them do that, then suffering there will be.  That’s why things like anxiety, fear, unpleasant feelings are natural to begin with and even exaggerated anxieties and fears. In other words, fearing things more often than it’s going to turn out to be warranted. All that is natural, but then you put us in a modern environment and things get even worse. You’re right, we're kind of doubly cursed.  Sean Illing  So how does Buddhism, or I guess more particularly, how does the practice of meditation make that better?  Robert Wright  Well, one implicit assumption of mindfulness meditation is that it makes sense to be suspicious of our feelings. In a certain sense, in a way that’s a big part of Buddhism that all of the things going on in your head are not necessarily to be taken very seriously. Again, evolutionary psychology I think drives that point home and explains why a lot of these feelings are not to be trusted.  Meditation is a discipline that helps you not take them seriously and that liberates you from the tyranny of feelings. It’s a technique for taking things ranging from anxiety to remorse to actual physical pain and they’re taking a perspective on them that somewhat releases you from their grip.  So it's just a technique for doing what both Buddhist philosophy says is well-advised and what, in a certain sense to me, evolutionary psychology says is well-advised, which is don’t take your feelings too seriously, especially certain feelings which are manifestly misleading, which manifestly cloud your vision and keep you from seeing the world clearly.  Sean Illing  You talk a lot about tribalism in the book, and I’d love to connect that to this idea of the self. I’m utterly convinced that the self is an illusion, albeit a very powerful one. I think we labor under the illusion that there is a thinker behind our thoughts or a doer behind our deeds when, in fact, I think we're just a field of consciousness responding to things in the world. One of the reasons why a lot of people like meditating, and one of the reasons why a lot of people are attracted to Buddhism, is because they think it's a path to the dissolution of the self or to cutting through that illusion, and the idea that that will make you somehow a better person and more engaged with other people and with the world around you. Is that what you believe?  Robert Wright  Well, Buddhism claims that we are subject to illusions and one of the main illusions Buddhism emphasizes is what they call the illusion of self. The other big illusion I talk about in the book is the illusion of projecting essence onto things, imaging that there’ some ultimate meaning or purpose. According to Buddhism, the proper view is to not project essences onto things.  I had an experience on my first retreat where I was walking through the woods and I saw a weed that I had really spent a lot of time trying to extract from my yard, and all of a sudden I didn’t understand why I had done that because it didn’t have essence of weed. It looked as beautiful as everything else and I was really just baffled like, ""Why am I doing that?""  As for self, that can mean different things and I probably focus more in the book on the meanings of not-self in Buddhism that are particularly well-corroborated by modern psychology, but certainly one of them is the one that I think you alluded to, the idea that the conscious self is really the CEO, that it’s like the doer of deeds. It’s the thinker of thoughts. You are really in charge consciously. There's a fair amount of evidence in recent psychology that that’s not the case. There are these studies that seem to show that if you ask experimental subjects to push a button whenever the want to, it turns out that the motor activity initiating that actions precedes the person’s conscious decision to do so. There's a lot evidence like this, and certainly the reports of really advanced meditators is that, ""Yeah, I just realized I thought I was in charge. It was an illusion. It wasn’t doing me any good. Things still work fine. I just watch it happen. They seem very relaxed.  I've had these experiences. They’re not always easy. I am not completely liberated from anxiety by any means, but I've had the experiences and this is another path to a form of not-self in Buddhism, which is a kind of incremental approach. You identify less and less with emotions and with thoughts. If you start doing that with all of the elements of your interior experience, then pretty soon the sense of self is not anything like what it used to be if you're not identifying with any of that stuff.  Sean Illing  I don’t want to tumble too far into the weeds and lose people, but this question of whether or not the self is real seems to me to have pretty profound implications for how we live. The difference between saying, ""I have a body"" and ""I am a body"" is vast and has ethical implications. A lot of what you write has to do with morality and how we can become better people. What’s the connection between mindfulness meditation and becoming more moral? Does one lead to the other?  Robert Wright  I think so. The superficial version of that is just that being stressed out tends to make you behave like a jerk. If you look at times when you've been rude to a checkout clerk or somebody, you were probably a little stressed out or something, so there’s that. If you just think of mindfulness in a strictly therapeutic sense, like mindfulness-based stress reduction, it’s probably going to make you a little easier to get along with.  I think the more you go down the path, the clearer the connection between practice and your everyday moral behavior. As I said, all the way down the path is this idea of emptiness where you’re not projecting essences onto lamps or weeds or people, but if you just get a little ways down the path and are reacting a little less emotionally to people, you can make real progress. Can I talk about a cognitive bias that fascinates me because it's so subtle?  Sean Illing  Sure.  Robert Wright  This is an example of what used to be called the fundamental attribution error. The idea was that we tend to, when we analyze people’s behavior, we attribute too much to their disposition and not enough to their situation. So we see somebody being a jerk at the checkout counter and we go, ""Oh, he’s a jerk,"" whereas in fact, he might've just had a bad day. He might've just found out he has cancer. Who knows, but the default thing tends to be, ""That’s the kind of person they are,"" whereas if you see somebody giving money to a homeless person, ""Oh, that’s a good charitable person.""  Now, it turns out it's more complicated than that, and here’s the way it actually works, which is that with our friends and allies, if they do something good, we attribute it to disposition. We at least tend to, and not to circumstance. If our friends and allies do something bad, if they misbehave, then we attribute it to circumstance, ""They were low on sleep. They were, peer group pressure,"" whatever. With our enemies, if they do something bad, we go, ""Yeah, that’s the kind of person they are. No surprise."" That is essence of them. If they do something good, we explain it away, ""Oh, he's showing off in front of some woman or something,"" and this is a deeply consequential fact, and it’s very, very subtle.  I think it’s one reason when people want to go to war. They spend so much time demonizing the leader of the country they want to invade because once he’s in that box, once everybody's thinking of him as the enemy, as a bad guy, there's nothing he can do to escape. Anything good he does, people will take as not representative of him and as just some kind of trick and anything bad he does will be taken as confirmation. I personally think you saw this in the run-up to the Iraq war, not that Saddam Hussein wasn't a genuinely bad guy, but I think like the Hitler comparisons had the effect of deeply influencing the way we process information about him. I think this has consequences on the scale of wars, whether they happen or not, but they also have consequence in everyday life.  If you look at people you consider rivals and enemies and think about it, and think about how you process their behavior, you'll find that you’re doing this. I know because I do it.  Sean Illing  This is why I'm always harping on the self as an illusion. It’s a story that we tell ourselves. It’s a way for us to narrativize our experience and give ourselves some kind of agency. We do this with everything. We tell stories about experience in order to give it some sort of cohesion or to make it internally coherent, or whatever the case may be. Any practice or any activity that helps you dissolve those stories and to cut through them and to just be more in contact with immediate experience, I think that makes you more empathic and maybe less prone to being a jerk.  Robert Wright  For somebody who claims they've never successfully meditated, you sound pretty close to enlightenment.  Sean Illing  Well it’s always easier to say the right words. Part of my personal frustration is that I’ve thought about these things, I think I understand them, and yet I still fail time and again to translate what I know into what I do. Knowing and doing are very different things.  Robert Wright  They are. This is what attracted me. After I wrote my book on evolutionary psychology, I was more aware than ever of the absurdity of being human. We have all these feelings that distort our vision that are unpleasant. We make these judgments about people that are self-centered. That was a big theme in the book, and yet I felt worse than before. I was more aware of all the unfortunate things about me. Buddhism isn’t a panacea, but it does offer a prescription.  Sean Illing  Let’s try to put a bow on this conversation by connecting it with something that feels concrete and urgent. You alluded to it a minute ago when you spoke about tribalism. We are deep sunk in a very tribalized climate where people are not talking to each other, are certainly not listening to each other across the aisle. I’m not sure you say this in your book explicitly, but do you think that if we were all meditating, or at least trying to be more mindful and to practice meditation regularly, that that would be socially and politically transformative?  Robert Wright  Absolutely. I just started this thing called mindful resistance. It's at mindfulresistance.net, and the idea isn’t that if we all meditate everything will magically get better. In fact, the idea isn’t even that you have to meditate to sign on to what I’m basically talking about. It’s enough if you just try to be mindful in the plain English sense of that word — just being aware, attentive, alive to other people.  Buddhism is very anti-essentialism and essentialism includes seeing essence of groups, which is what racism is. If you view all Trump supporters as bigots or idiots, I think that’s a big mistake. Even if it were true that they were all racists, I would want to know how they became racist. I don't think people are born like that. I would want to know what circumstances made them like that. There's so many things that seem worthy of outrage, in my view at least, that are happening that it’s hard to know when maybe you’re going too far.  I think it’s always a useful exercise to try to understand how people are reacting to the world, what made them the way they are, and I think that is, in a way, more urgently needed than emotional empathy.",6.0,2.0
1493,3161,11,7,2017,2017-11-07,Fox News,US job openings flat in September as hurricanes slow hiring,"U.S. employers posted roughly the same number of open jobs in September as the previous month, partly because hurricanes held back hiring at restaurants and hotels.  The Labor Department said Tuesday that 6.09 million jobs were available at the end of September, not far from the record high of 6.14 million reached in July. The number of open jobs in restaurants and hotels fell 111,000 from August. That reflects widespread damage in the wake of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which struck many vacation spots in Texas, Florida and other southeastern states.  Overall, thousands of businesses were closed, which likely held back hiring. Total hires fell 2.7 percent to 5.27 million in September, the lowest in five months.  Excluding the storms' impact, the job market remains mostly healthy. The government said last week that employers added 261,000 jobs in October. That partly reflected a recovery in hiring after the hurricanes dragged down job gains in September.  October's figure is a net gain after layoffs, quits and retirements are subtracted from overall hiring. Tuesday's data is from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey, or JOLTS. They are more detailed and provide a fuller view of the job market than the monthly jobs report.  The two reports paint a picture of employers struggling to fill jobs in tight labor market. The unemployment rate fell to 4.1 percent in October, the lowest in 17 years.  Employers have a dwindling pool of those out of work to choose from. There were just 1.12 unemployed people, on average, for every open job in September. During the 2008-2009 Great Recession, that figure reached 6 unemployed people for every available job.  When employers are desperate to hire, they typically offer higher pay to find and keep employees. Yet a variety of data suggests that wages are rising slowly. Hourly pay rose just 2.4 percent in October from a year earlier, the government said Friday.  The last time the unemployment rate was as low as it is now, pay was increasing at about 4 percent a year.  Americans are quitting their jobs at a healthy pace, which helps lift pay gains. But they may need to do so more often to push wages higher. Nearly 3.2 million quit in September, near a post-recession peak reached in May. Still, the pace of quits has barely increased in the past 18 months.  Most workers quit to take new jobs, which typically pay more. Data collected by payroll processor ADP found that from July through September, full-time workers who switched jobs saw their earnings rise 4.9 percent from a year earlier. Those who stayed in their jobs saw a smaller gain of 4.3 percent.  The disparities between those who switched jobs and those who stayed were much higher in some industries. In leisure and hospitality, which includes restaurants and hotels as well as bars and casinos, those who quit and took new jobs saw annual gains of 6.9 percent. Those who stayed in their jobs saw just a 4.8 percent gain.  In a category that includes high-tech workers, switchers saw pay gains of 6.1 percent, compared with 5.1 percent for those who stayed in their jobs.",10.0,3.0
201,1208,9,21,2017,2017-09-21,Associated Press News,"US beefs up NKorea sanctions, Kim Jong Un insults Trump","President Donald Trump listens during a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the Palace Hotel during the United Nations General Assembly, Thursday, Sept. 21, 2017, in New York. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)  NEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump added economic action to his fiery military threats against North Korea on Thursday, authorizing stiffer new sanctions in response to the Koreans’ nuclear weapons advances. Its leader Kim Jong Un issued a rare statement, branding Trump as “deranged” and warning he will “pay dearly” for his threat to “totally destroy” the North if it attacks.  The exchange of super-heated rhetoric and unusually personal abuse between the adversaries will escalate tensions that have been mounting as North Korea has marched closer to achieving a nuclear-tipped missile that could strike America. The crisis has dominated the Trump’s debut at this week’s annual U.N. General Assembly meeting.  Kim’s statement, carried by North Korea’s official news agency in a dispatch from Pyongyang early Friday, responded to Trump’s combative speech days earlier where he not only issued the warning of potential obliteration for the isolated nation, but also mocked the North’s young autocrat as a “Rocket Man” on a “suicide mission.”  Kim offered choice insults of his own.  He said Trump was “unfit to hold the prerogative of supreme command of a country.” He described the president as “a rogue and a gangster fond of playing with fire.” He characterized Trump’s speech to the world body on Tuesday as “mentally deranged behavior.”  President Trump announced Thursday he signed a new order to help the U.S. target people, companies and banks financing and facilitating trade with North Korea. He also said China has ordered its banks to stop all business with North Korea. (Sept. 21)  “I will make the man holding the prerogative of the supreme command in the U.S. pay dearly for his speech calling for totally destroying the DPRK,” said the statement carried by Korean Central News Agency.  DPRK is the abbreviation of the communist country’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.  There was no immediate response from the White House.  On Thursday in New York, Trump announced the latest steps to punish foreign companies that deal with the North. It was the latest salvo in a U.S.-led campaign to isolate and impoverish Kim’s government until it halts the missile and nuclear tests. He announced the measures as he met leaders from South Korea and Japan, the nations most immediately imperiled by North Korea’s threats of a military strike.  “North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile development is a grave threat to peace and security in our world and it is unacceptable that others financially support this criminal, rogue regime,” Trump said as he joined Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean President Moon Jae-in for lunch. “Tolerance for this disgraceful practice must end now.”  His executive order expanded the Treasury Department’s ability to target anyone conducting significant trade in goods, services or technology with North Korea, and to ban them from interacting with the U.S. financial system.  “Foreign financial institutions must choose between doing business with the United States or facilitating trade with North Korea or its designated supporters,” the order says. It also issues a 180-day ban on vessels and aircraft that have visited North Korea from visiting the United States.  Trump also said China was imposing major banking sanctions, too, but there was no immediate confirmation from the North’s most important trading partner. China’s central bank would not take questions by phone Friday and did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.  Trump praised China for instructing its banks to cut off business with Pyongyang, but neither the Chinese nor Trump officials were ready to say so. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said he had spoken at length Thursday with the head of China’s central bank but “I am not going to comment on confidential discussions.”  If enforced, the Chinese action Trump described could severely impede the isolated North’s ability to raise money for its missile and nuclear development. China, responsible for about 90 percent of North Korea’s trade, serves as the country’s conduit to the international banking system.  Trump said the China action he described “was a somewhat unexpected move and we appreciate it.”  China remains leery of pressuring North Korea into collapse and has resisted cutting off its critical oil supplies, not wanting chaos on its border. Along with Russia, China wants the U.S. to seek dialogue with the North. American officials say the time isn’t right for any formal diplomatic process. Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Thursday that negotiations are the “only way out” of the nuclear standoff.  Several news outlets this month have reported Chinese steps to restrict banking transactions, but the government hasn’t made a formal announcement. Asked for comment last week, the Foreign Ministry said China has always fully implemented U.N. sanctions on North Korea but opposes “unilateral” restrictions imposed by another country on Chinese entities. China’s embassy in Washington declined to comment Thursday.  The focus on economic measures by Washington had at least temporarily shifted focus from the talk of military action that has caused unease, even among U.S. allies. In his speech to the U.N. on Tuesday, Trump spoke of his own nation’s patience, but said that if “forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.”  Trump’s messengers backed him up in television appearances Thursday. Vice President Mike Pence told Fox News: “We do not desire a military conflict. But the president has made it very clear, as he did at the U.N. this week, that all options are on the table and we are simply not going to tolerate a rogue regime in Pyongyang obtaining usable nuclear weapons that could be mounted on a ballistic missile and threaten the people of the United States or our allies.”  Trump’s heated language was rare for a U.S. president at the rostrum of the United Nations. But the speech was textbook Trump, dividing the globe into friends and foes and taking unflinching aim at America’s enemies.  ___  Associated Press writer Darlene Superville contributed to this report.  ___  Follow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@mattpenn_99 and Lemire at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire",5.0,8.0

Foxconn, the Taiwanese manufacturer, is coming to Wisconsin with a big investment. The CEO, Terry Gou, says Foxconn will invest $10 billion in an LCD panel plant. Foxconn, of course, is an electronics manufacturing powerhouse, assembling products for Apple and Microsoft from its Chinese factories. Gou teased bringing production to the U.S. shortly after his inauguration, but the CEO there has promised that before with little result. For example, back in 2013, Foxconn announced a $30 million plant in Pennsylvania.[t still hasn't been built. The big difference here, Wisconsin is offering generous tax incentives, totaling as much as $3 billion of taxpayer money. Governor Scott Walker says the project will create 13,000 jobs by the year 2020. That would cost the state about $230,000 per job. But, John, Foxconn was a bit more conservative with its job estimates. The company says it will create 3,000 jobs with the potential of generating 13,000. Certainly 3,000 jobs in Wisconsin, John, is a drop in the bucket for this humongous company. It employs a million workers, as I said, in Asia. You might recall this company had a real hit to its reputation back in 2011 after a spate of worker suicides. At the time, the CEO said he would begin to position the company away from human labor and toward robotics. John?  JOHN KING (HOST): Christine Romans breaking down the numbers of the deal. Without a doubt, the president got a chance to stand at the White House yesterday and say a company that does most of its work overseas is going to bring jobs to America. That's a good thing. There is the debate about the numbers. Does it matter? Does it matter if they bring 3,000 jobs to Wisconsin or 13,000 jobs to Wisconsin? Can you score this one as a win for the president? Showing that he -- this is being more like a governor than a president. You know, sort of getting everybody to get together and figure out a deal to get a company to come.  JEFF ZELENY: I think you score a win for the president, no question, but it does matter, of course. The state of Wisconsin, the General Assembly and the Senate, still have to vote on this. And I was talking with the speaker of the General Assembly, who was at the White House yesterday, and he hopes to call a special session in August for this. But this is the biggest deal Wisconsin has done in terms of a sweetener, so $3 billion, that’s a lot of money. The fine print on this will not look as good as the big announcement, but still it's, of course, a big deal, without question.  [...]  ABBY PHILLIP: I do think you have to give Trump credit, and in some ways you have to look at this as a rare moment recently of the White House doing kind of what it's supposed to be doing. Having a big East Room ceremony on something that is central to his platform and having the president be on message about this. I mean, you can have a lot, another conversation about whether the Republican Party is typically in this kind of business of meting out deal by deal, bringing jobs company by company back to the United States, but that's what this particular president promised to do. And if he's fulfilling that promise, more of that and less of all the other stuff.",1.0,1.0

Television is one of the few screens that has Apple hasn’t conquered, but that may soon change. The world’s richest company appears ready to set out to produce Emmy-worthy programming along the lines of HBO’s “Game of Thrones” and Netflix’s “Stranger Things.” (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File)  SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Television is one of the few screens that has Apple hasn’t conquered, but that may soon change. The world’s richest company appears ready to aim for its own Emmy-worthy programming along the lines of HBO’s “Game of Thrones” and Netflix’s “Stranger Things.”  Apple lured away two longtime TV executives Jaime Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg from Sony Corp. in June and has given them $1 billion to spend on original shows during the next year, according to a Wall Street Journal report quoting unnamed people.  The programming would only be available on a subscription channel, most likely bundled with the company’s existing Apple Music streaming service. Apple declined to comment.  While $1 billion is a lot of money, it’s a drop in the bucket for Apple and its $262 billion cash hoard. But it’s still enough to vault Apple into the top tier of tech-industry outsiders producing their own slates of television shows.  HISTORY NOT REPEATING  Hollywood has long shuddered at the thought of Apple training its sights on TV the way it once did on the music business.  Almost 15 years ago, Apple’s then-CEO Steve Jobs convinced record labels to let the company sell digital music on its iTunes store for 99 cents a single, a deal the music industry was happy to take in the face of growing music piracy enabled by Napster. Over time, though, Apple’s dominance in digital music chafed music executives, who saw the company siphoning off a chunk of their profits.  Movies and television have proven much harder for Apple to crack. The company’s interest in transforming television has been an open secret for years, but Hollywood has so far spurned Apple’s efforts to make itself an indispensable digital middleman for video.  In a way, Netflix beat Apple to the punch with its ground-breaking video streaming service. Launched in 2007, that service pioneered “binge watching” of entire TV seasons on any device with an internet connection. That gave new life to existing shows such as “Breaking Bad,” whose creator credits Netflix with its survival , and spawned the creation of other series tailor-made for bingeing.  Netflix also helped unleash a crescendo of creativity in Hollywood. Follow-on rivals Amazon and Hulu also boast popular video streaming services, and mainstream broadcasters such as CBS and Walt Disney Co. — the owner of ABC and ESPN, among other networks — are also jumping in.  BUSINESS NECESSITY  All of that has increased the pressure on Apple to step up its game in TV — not least because the increasing popularity of streaming is hurting its business of renting and selling video from iTunes.  Apple “doesn’t want to be left behind,” said Debby Ruth, senior vice president of consumer research firm Magid. “This is a way for them to put a stake in the ground.”  This year, the company released its first two original series — “Planet of the Apps” and “Carpool Karaoke” — on its Apple Music service, which has 27 million subscribers. But neither show has generated much buzz or critical acclaim.  The recent hiring of Erlicht and Van Amburg signaled Apple’s intent to make bigger splash. The executives have helped orchestrate several TV hits, including AMC’s “Breaking Bad,” and more recently branched out into video streaming with “The Crown,” which landed on Netflix last year and is up for 13 Emmy nominations in the Sept. 17 ceremony.  Apple also has a not-so-secret weapon: hundreds of millions of iPhones and iPads already in the hands of faithful fans. It could easily transform those into a marketing platform to lure users to its TV service.  MAKING IT IN HOLLYWOOD  But the company has a steep hill to climb.  Netflix has more than 100 million worldwide subscribers and a video library that will add 1,000 hours of original programming this year alone. And HBO has become the Emmys’ pacesetter since branching into original programming 20 years ago.  Both companies vastly outspend Apple’s reported $1 billion production budget. HBO spends about $2 billion annually on its programming, which garnered 111 nominations in this year’s Emmy Awards — more than any other network. Netflix, which boasts the second most Emmy nominations with 91, expects to spend $6 billion on programming this year.  Apple is still experimenting in TV, said Gene Munster, a longtime Apple watcher and managing partner with the research and venture capital firm Loup Ventures. “In five years, I bet Apple will either be investing $10 billion a year in content or zero,” said Munster. “It’s going to be one or the other.”  JOBS’ LEGACY  Jobs discussed his ambitions to shake up TV with his biographer Walter Issacson shortly before his death in 2011. “He very much wanted to do for television sets what he had done for computers, music players, and phones: make them simple and elegant,” Isaacson wrote.  But no Apple television ever materialized. Instead, Apple has periodically upgraded its Apple TV, which isn’t a television — just a video streaming player that connects to TVs. That device has been losing market share to other streaming players made by Roku, Amazon and Google, according to the research firm Park Associates.  Building a successful programming line-up could give Apple more leverage to license shows from other Hollywood production houses. It might even embolden the company to finally release its own streaming TV set.  Apple will presumably also want to emulate Netflix’s ability to exploit usage data to determine what it thinks audiences want to watch. Netflix’s data analysis has helped it attract 25.5 million more subscribers in the U.S. alone since the February 2013 debut of its first original series, “House of Cards.”  But if Apple decides it needs a little more help in video streaming, Munster thinks there’s in one-in-three chance that it will buy Netflix to instantly gain the cachet and expertise in TV programming that it craves.",2.0,2.0
1549,3217,11,6,2017,2017-11-06,Vox,Did Rand Paul really get beat up over lawn clippings?,"A new report from GQ goes deeper into the possible tensions between Sen. Rand Paul and the neighbor who attacked him earlier this month — the latest development in a strange saga that began when Rene Boucher tackled the senator on November 3, breaking six of his ribs.  The GQ report doesn’t extinguish the mystery, but provides more details about Boucher’s bubbling frustration over what he saw as Rand Paul’s disregard for landscaping etiquette, including the senator’s alleged habit of mowing too close to Boucher’s lawn and spraying grass clipping over the property line.  The attack on Paul has been shrouded in obscurity for weeks. Boucher’s lawyer released a statement that claimed the source of the matter was a “trivial dispute.” Media reports also painted a picture of a long-simmering property dispute between the two men, possibly over landscaping or yard waste. Other reports speculated on a possible political dispute.  But Paul’s chief strategist denied the men had squabbled and said Paul hadn’t spoken to Boucher in years. “The first ‘conversation'‘with the attacker,” his chief strategist, Doug Stafford, said, “came after Sen. Paul's ribs were broken.”  Paul returned to work a little more than a week after Boucher’s violent assault. On Friday, he said in a video posted on Twitter, said it had been a “rough couple of weeks,” but he’s getting better and working on tax reform.  Here’s what we know about the saga so far.  Paul was mowing his lawn when a neighbor tackled him  Paul had reportedly just finished mowing his lawn on November 3 at his home in Rivergreen, an upscale gated community in Bowling Green when Boucher tackled him from behind, “forcing him to the ground and causing pain,” reported NBC News, which obtained the criminal complaint.  Paul was wearing protective earmuffs to muffle the sound of the mower, two sources told the New York Times, which prevented him from hearing Boucher’s approach. (The senator told US Weekly in a 2015 interview that he loved working in his yard and that “mowing the lawn is very therapeutic for me.”)  NBC News reported that Paul managed to get Boucher off him, after which the two “exchanged words.”  Here is a repost of arrest warrant for Rand Paul incident. This one has redactions. Sincere apologies about missing that last time pic.twitter.com/eDMEOy7hGs — Sam Stein (@samstein) November 6, 2017  Jim Skaggs, a neighbor and one of the developers of the Rivergreen gated community, speculated in GQ that Boucher charged Paul from the street:  From that direction, Paul's yard slopes steeply downward, toward the lake at the rear of his property. Barreling downward about 30 degrees, this imagined path would increase the force of a running tackle, perhaps explaining how a man of Boucher's diminutive stature—an acquaintance of the two men estimates that they both stand five-foot-six and weigh about 140 pounds—could do so much damage.  Boucher, who admitted to tackling Paul in the criminal complaint, was charged with one count of fourth-degree assault, and was released from custody Saturday night on $7,500 bond. He pleaded not guilty during a court appearance on November 9.  State police said Paul had sustained “minor injuries” in the first reports after the incident. But, in the weekend after the attack, Paul’s staffer, Doug Stafford, said in a statement to the Washington Post that the fractured ribs — three of which were partly or completely cracked — had bruised at least one of Paul’s lungs.  “This type of injury is caused by high velocity severe force,” Stafford said. “It is not clear exactly how soon he will return to work, as the pain is considerable as is the difficulty in getting around, including flying.” He described the injuries as those that could lead to serious and long-term health ramifications.  The senator clarified his condition for the first time on November 8. In the tweet, Paul said he broke six ribs (it had originally been reported as five) and suffered from a pleural effusion, which is a buildup of fluid in lining in the outside of the lungs.  I appreciate all of the support from everyone. A medical update: final report indicates six broken ribs & new X-ray shows a pleural effusion — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) November 8, 2017  The investigation continues. Neighbors are talking. But the motive isn’t clear.  Kentucky State Police are investigating the incident in coordination with the FBI, which is standard because Paul is a member of Congress.  The FBI is examining whether the assault on Paul amounts to a federal crime, and prosecutors with the Warren County Commonwealth's Attorney also told the Bowling Green Daily News that they are reviewing the charge, and may update or add to the charges given the apparent seriousness of Paul’s injuries. Boucher has also been ordered to stay at least 200 feet away from Paul.  Fourth-degree assault in Kentucky is a Class A misdemeanor, and Boucher, if convicted, could face up to a year in jail and up to a $500 fine.  No additional charges were added when Boucher entered a “not guilty” plea in court on November 9. According to the Associated Press, Boucher “barely spoke in the courtroom, only saying ‘yes sir’ to a judge.”  Boucher is a retired doctor who practiced as an anesthesiologist and pain specialist; his medical license expired in 2015. According to a Bowling Green Daily News report from 2005, Boucher also invented the Therm-a-Vest, a device that attaches by Velcro and heats up to help with chronic back pain. It was featured on QVC.  The two men who live next door to each other and previously worked together as doctors, may have argued about politics in the past. Jim Bullington, who served on the city commission and was acquainted with both Paul and Boucher, told the Post that the men are political opposites and have had “heated discussions” about health care. One unidentified neighbor told WAVE 3 News that Paul and Boucher had “ongoing” problems — though the report did not elaborate on what those might be.  The Washington Post also said a Facebook page that appeared to belong to Boucher contained some anti-Trump memes.  Boucher’s attorney, in a November 6 statement denied that the attack had anything to do with politics, and instead called it a “regrettable dispute between two neighbors over a matter that most people would regard as trivial”:  Senator Paul and Dr. Boucher have been next door neighbors for 17 years. They are also prominent members of the local medical community and worked together when they were both practicing physicians. The unfortunate occurrence of November 3rd has absolutely nothing to do with either’s politics or political agendas. It was a very regrettable dispute between two neighbors over a matter that most people would regard as trivial. We sincerely hope that Senator Paul is doing well and that these two gentlemen can get back to being neighbors as quickly as possible.  Jonathan Martin of the New York Times has reported that this “trivial” issue might have something to do with some mysterious plant-related problems; sources gave multiple landscape-based reasons that ranged from a new sapling to yard clippings to unraked leaves. NBC News added a wild card: an issue over the property line of a creek behind Paul’s house where his sons used to play.  Two Kentuckians tell me Rand’s neighborhood fracas stemmed from a dispute over some sort of planting or flora issue around the properties — Jonathan Martin (@jmartNYT) November 6, 2017  An unnamed neighbor also told CNN that these lawn-based tensions had long been simmering, though Rob Porter, friend of Paul’s, said the senator told him he hadn’t spoken to Boucher in years. “He is still unsure why he was attacked,” Porter said. “I don’t know if he knows why he was attacked.”  Rand Paul and neighbor have been sparring over yard waste and leaves blown on each other's lawns for years, a neighbor tells @DrewGriffinCNN — Manu Raju (@mkraju) November 6, 2017  Paul added more intrigue by retweeting two stories that cast doubt on the “landscaping dispute” story, both of which originated in conservative news outlets, the Washington Examiner and Breitbart.  Stafford, Paul’s chief strategist, also knocked the idea of a Paul-Boucher dispute. “The first ‘conversation’ with the attacker came after Sen. Paul's ribs were broken,” he said. “This was not a ‘fight,’ it was a blindside, violent attack by a disturbed person. Anyone claiming otherwise is simply uninformed or seeking media attention.”  GQ, in a story published Monday, dug into questions of politics and lawn care. The report, speaking to neighbors and acquaintances in the Bowling Green community, pointed at two men whose personalities clashed, and that played out in a property dispute that left Boucher festering in anger and frustration.  According to GQ, Boucher faced some personal setbacks in recent years, including a divorce in 2008. He had tried to sell his house in the gated community soon after, but he had trouble finding a buyer. Boucher ended up staying put after a deal fell through in 2012.  Boucher, according to neighbors, was a stickler when it came to his property. He paid professionals to tend to his yard, but, his neighbor, Paul did his own landscaping. And it may not have been up to Boucher’s standards. “He had his yard sitting at a beautiful two-and-a-half, three inches thick, where Rand cuts it to the nub,” Bill Goodwin, a Bowling Green resident who knows both men, told GQ.  Paul, hobbyist mower that he is, also may not have been the most attentive at the post-yard work cleanup. Boucher fretted over Paul’s grass clippings that ended up in his yard, confronting the senator and complaining to the neighborhood association. “I've asked him and I've asked him and I've asked him,” Goodwin remembers Boucher complaining about the senator’s lawn etiquette. “How long can you sit there taking someone plucking a hair out of your nose?”  Still, even if Boucher was scrupulous about lawn care, stray grass clippings rarely lead to broken ribs. And neighbors in the upscale neighborhood aren’t thrilled about how the incident brought scrutiny on their neighborhood. One person, talking to GQ, called both the attacker and the victim “two little shits.”  Boucher will return to court November 30 for a pretrial hearing.  Paul could have pain for “weeks or months” — but he’s returned to the Senate  Paul, left bloodied and bruised after the attack, faces a potentially prolonged recovery. “This type of injury is also accompanied by severe pain that can last weeks to months,” Stafford said.  But last Monday, Paul confirmed on Twitter that he was still in a “good deal of pain,” but said he’s heading back to Washington. “I will be returning to work in the Senate today,” he wrote, “ready to fight for liberty and help move forward with tax cuts in the coming days and weeks.  Kelley and I want to thank everyone once again for your thoughts and prayers for my recovery. While I’m still in a good deal of pain, I will be returning to work in the Senate today, ready to fight for liberty and help move forward with tax cuts in the coming days and weeks. — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) November 13, 2017  Even President Donald Trump offered his well wishes.  Great to see @RandPaul looking well and back on the Senate floor. He will help us with TAX CUTS and REFORM! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 14, 2017  This is good news for Republicans. A prolonged absence by Paul could have complicated things for the party, which has been relying on their slim majority in the upper chamber to push through their legislative agenda. The GOP is following an aggressive timeline to pass tax reform by the end of the year. Paul’s vote may be necessary to pass the Senate’s version of the tax bill without Democratic votes (and integral to pretty much everything else on the Republican to-do list).  Of course, Paul is not always a reliable vote for the GOP. He was the sole Republican senator who voted against the Senate budget resolution that changed the rules for passing tax legislation because he wanted deeper cuts. He might again be a spoiler on the Senate’s tax bill. So far he has signaled his support — though he is among the senators supporting a repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate in the Senate plan.  The attack on Paul also adds to questions over the security of lawmakers, as the Wall Street Journal points out. In June, a gunman opened fire at a GOP congressional baseball practice, injuring four people, including severely wounding House Majority Whip Steve Scalise. Paul, who was at the practice that day, escaped unharmed.",1.0,2.0
268,1591,10,3,2017,2017-10-03,Breitbart,Equifax Given Huge IRS Fraud-Prevention Contract Following Massive Security Breach,"The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has awarded Equifax a $7.25 million fraud-prevention contract following the company’s massive security breach which affected over 140 million consumers.  According to Politico, “The IRS will pay Equifax $7.25 million to verify taxpayer identities and help prevent fraud under a no-bid contract issued last week.”  “The credit agency will ‘verify taxpayer identity’ and ‘assist in ongoing identity verification and validations’ at the IRS, according to the award,” Politico’s reported. “The notice describes the contract as a ‘sole source order,’ meaning Equifax is the only company deemed capable of providing the service. It says the order was issued to prevent a lapse in identity checks while officials resolve a dispute over a separate contract.”  In September, it was reported that Equifax had been the victim of a large cyberattack, which potentially left over 140 million consumers’ personal information vulnerable.  Following the attack, Equifax blamed the attack on a single employee who failed to implement a patch. However, according to Tech Crunch, “a patch for that vulnerability had been available for months before the breach occurred.”  The company faced further controversy following the discovery that Equifax’s Terms of Service included a clause in their security assistance website which barred consumers from being able to sue the company before they removed it following consumer backlash.  It was also revealed that the company had been encouraging consumers to visit the wrong security website, a fake, which could have easily been used as a phishing scam and taken more information.  Several lawmakers have criticized the IRS’ decision, including Rep. Suzan DelBene (D-WA) and Earl Blumenauer (D-OR), the latter of which claimed, “I was initially under the impression that my staff was sharing a copy of the Onion, until I realized this story was, in fact, true.”  Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) also criticized the IRS over the contract in separate comments.  “In the wake of one of the most massive data breaches in a decade, it’s irresponsible for the IRS to turn over millions in taxpayer dollars to a company that has yet to offer a succinct answer on how at least 145 million Americans had personally identifiable information exposed,” declared Sen. Hatch to Politico.  In his own comment, Sen. Wyden added, “The Finance Committee will be looking into why Equifax was the only company to apply for and be rewarded with this. I will continue to take every measure possible to prevent taxpayer data from being compromised as this arrangement moves forward.”  In a statement, the IRS defended their decision, declaring, “Following an internal review and an on-site visit with Equifax, the IRS believes the service Equifax provided does not pose a risk to IRS data or systems.”  “At this time, we have seen no indications of tax fraud related to the Equifax breach, but we will continue to closely monitor the situation,” they proclaimed.  Last month, the U.S. Justice Department reportedly “opened a criminal investigation into the sale of Equifax stock by high-ranking executives just days before the company revealed they had been the subject of a massive data breach,” while Equifax CEO Richard Smith retired from his position a week later.

1322,2921,10,24,2017,2017-10-24,Vox,Congress is making harassment trainings mandatory. Science shows they don't work.,"With the deluge of high-profile sexual harassment allegations in Hollywood and the media, leaders are turning toward an ostensibly simple solution: make anti-sexual harassment training mandatory in workplaces.  That sentiment has also reached Capitol Hill, where harassment allegation reports recently emerged. ""Going forward, the House will adopt a policy of mandatory anti-harassment and anti-discrimination training for all Members and staff,” House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) said in a statement Tuesday. “Our goal is not only to raise awareness, but also make abundantly clear that harassment in any form has no place in this institution.”  There’s just one problem with this initiative: It’s probably not going to do anything to curb sexual harassment.  The research from sociology and organizational psychology on the billion-dollar anti-harassment training industry suggests these programs aren’t actually effective at stopping or preventing abuse.  “Over 90 percent of large US employers have harassment trainings in place, but it’s having very little effect, if no discernible effect, on the overall number of harassment complaints that are reported,” Harvard sociologist Frank Dobbin told Vox. “I don’t think we can sit around and wait for training to solve the problem.”  Experts who study workplace harassment view these trainings as more of a strategic defense against future lawsuits than a solution to a pervasive problem.  As reports of sexual misconduct continue to pop up — at Miramax and Weinstein, at Uber, even at Vox’s parent company, Vox Media — the call for solutions will continue to grow. And the go-to fix might not be a fix at all.  How court cases led to the rise of harassment training programs  When a new employee joins an organization, he or she is often asked to watch a series of videos or sit through a talk on what the law says about harassment, how to protect yourself or your employees from harassment, and how to report incidents. These programs range from movie vignettes to in-person discussions to online quizzes, and they’re often sprinkled with cringeworthy moments like one from this 1993 video. “Customer service is part of your job description,” a male boss tells his female worker, after one of the company’s clients asks her out on a date.  Now a mainstay of the American work culture, these programs didn’t come out of nowhere. In her study of harassment trainings, Elizabeth Tippett, an associate professor at the University of Oregon School of Law, traces the legal history of trainings in part to the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s 1980 guidelines, which said employers could be held liable for harassment and suggested companies take steps to prevent the problem, including educating employees about harassment.  Workplace harassment cases also started to pop up in the Supreme Court around the mid-1980s. The 1986 Meritor Saving Bank v. Vinson case, for example, featured a bank VP who sexually harassed a bank manager.  The Vinson decision didn’t mention employee harassment training, as Thomas Jefferson School of Law professor Susan Bisom-Rapp pointed out in her article “Fixing Watches With Sledgehammers: The Questionable Embrace of Employee Sexual Harassment Training by the Legal Profession.” Rather, litigation prevention was already seen as the main goal of harassment training, and the Vinson case helped “fuel the training trend.”  So over time, as trainings were increasingly viewed as a way to prevent lawsuits, courts increasingly saw them as a key part of legal compliance, Tippett said.  Today, the vast majority of large American companies have some kind of harassment training in place, which generally costs $100,000 or more, according to Marketplace. California and Connecticut also require harassment trainings for all employees at organizations with 50 or more supervisors, and Maine has a similar requirement for companies with 15 or more supervisors. The biggest players in the anti-harassment training space include Emtrain, Kantola, and Traliant, and the industry’s annual revenue may reach into the billions.  Anti-harassment programs can help educate employees about harassment, but they don't change behavior  But do these trainings actually stop harassment from occurring?  A wonk-ish must-read for every company or employee interested in this question is the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s task force study on harassment in the workplace. Published in 2016, the report painstakingly reviewed the data and research evidence on workplace harassment and came to some very striking conclusions.  Over the past three decades, the authors reported, workplace harassment training and prevention programs have blossomed into a “cottage industry.” And while trainings appear to help participants understand what constitutes workplace harassment, there’s no good evidence that trainings change attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors.  “Almost fully one third of the approximately 90,000 charges received by the EEOC in fiscal year 2015 included an allegation of workplace harassment,” the report reads. “Much of the training done over the last 30 years has not worked as a prevention tool — it’s been too focused on simply avoiding legal liability.”  Consider the EEOC’s data here. You can see that the numbers of harassment complaints at the federal level have stagnated or even increased since 2010. Harvard's Dobbin has analyzed data going back even further, and he says the trend lines look much the same over the longer term.  “[Harassment training] is often a veneer, or what I call symbolic compliance,” said Lauren Edelman, a professor of law and sociology at Berkeley Law. The problem, she continued, is that courts don’t distinguish between legal procedures that are a veneer and those that are actually effective.  Harassment is also vastly underreported. According to the EEOC, some three in four people who experience workplace harassment never tell their employers it occurred. “This [data] is the tip of the iceberg,” Dobbin said.  But the few cases of harassment that are reported are already costing a lot of companies dearly: The EEOC recovered $164.5 million for victims alleging harassment in 2015 alone. It also estimated that turnover costs — employees who simply leave companies after being bothered in the workplace — are an even bigger financial burden than any legal fee.  Truly preventing harassment involves addressing systemic inequalities in your workplace  While the EEOC’s review of training programs is overall pretty damning, it does recommend that employers regularly brief their workers on anti-harassment policies and procedures — again, because they can be effective at educating employees about what harassment is. But the EEOC notes that these trainings need to be part of a “holistic effort” to address harassment.  That seems to be the major point about anti-harassment trainings: In isolation, they are nothing more than a Band-Aid solution. Companies have to reckon with their cultures and address systemic inequalities within their organizations that may be enabling harassment if they truly want to prevent this type of discrimination from occurring.  “There are two things that are really problematic,” said Dobbin. “One is when there are huge power differentials between men and women, and the other problem is when you have huge differentials in the gender composition of a job.”  The EEOC identified workplaces with significant power disparities and workplaces that lacked diversity among the top risk factors for harassment. The Harvey Weinstein example is the perfect case in point. Female actresses are notoriously underpaid relative to men, while male actors can have careers that are more lucrative and run longer.  “A situation like Weinstein is symptomatic of an underlying inequality in the workplace,” Tippett said. “That doesn’t mean training is the best way to address that, but it’s what’s happened.”  Fox News is another case in point. In early 2016, the network decided it had to clean up its image and culture, as stories about the late CEO Roger Ailes’s multimillion-dollar sexual harassment settlements piled up.  The company doubled down on anti-harassment seminars, mandating them for all Fox workers, including freelancers. But Fox has since been embroiled in numerous other harassment scandals involving its stars Eric Bolling and Bill O’Reilly. (The New York Times recently reported Fox paid $32 million last January to settle just a single harassment lawsuit against O’Reilly, the sixth such agreement involving O’Reilly that’s become public.)  Companies that truly want to stop harassment have to work on closing gaps in gender equality, by increasing the number of women in leadership roles, while conveying that harassment won’t be tolerated.  “If women were more represented at higher levels of organizations, including the very top, and represented in significant numbers, that might help,” said Berkeley’s Edelman.  Workplaces that encourage alcohol consumption are also at a higher risk of having their workers embroiled in harassment situations, and reducing the opportunities for drinking might help mitigate the risk. Finally, workplaces need to have systems in place that hold people who engage in harassment accountable so that would-be harassers know the behavior won’t be tolerated.  Making these changes is a lot more difficult than just adding a video module that new employees need to click through when joining an organization. But they could be profound, especially at a time when problems with harassment extend all the way up to the highest levels of government.  The president of the United States has been the subject of numerous sexual harassment allegations, and many of the women who have come forward about harassment recently said they did so after Trump was elected to the White House. For now, though, Trump’s infamous Access Hollywood conversation is reportedly fodder for the corporate anti-harassment trainers at Fox News.",11.0,11.0

1147,2726,10,28,2017,2017-10-28,Associated Press News,Saudi crown prince favors extending OPEC production limits,"Saudi Arabia’s crown prince says his country supports extending an agreement by major oil producers to limit output beyond next March.  Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said Saturday that the OPEC-led agreement is necessary to balance supply with demand.  Saudi Arabia is the world’s largest producer and the most influential member of OPEC. The agreement, which kicked in at the start of 2017, also included Russia and other non-OPEC countries.  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is expected to take up the agreement at its next meeting on Nov. 30.  In a statement, Prince Mohammed said that Saudi Arabia “affirms its readiness to extend the production cut agreement, which proved its feasibility by rebalancing supply and demand.”  The effect of the production limits approved by major oil countries has been muted by rising output from U.S. shale-oil producers. The prince said that high demand for oil has absorbed the increased supply from shale oil.  “The journey toward restoring balance to markets, led by the Kingdom, is proving successful despite the challenges,” he said.  On Friday, Brent Crude, the international benchmark oil, rose above $60 for the first time since 2015 as traders grew increasingly confident that OPEC will continue to limit pumping.  The slump in oil prices that began in mid-2014 has created budget problems for Saudi Arabia and other major producers. Prince Mohammed has laid out a sweeping plan to wean Saudi Arabia off its near total dependence on oil exports.  Jim Krane, an energy expert at Rice University in Houston, said Saudi Arabia needs to keep oil prices up to balance its budget and make the upcoming public sale of stock in Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil company, attractive to investors.  “Nobody is going to want a piece of Saudi Aramco with oil under $40, which is where it would be if OPEC wasn’t choking off supply,” he said.  Krane said OPEC cutbacks and higher prices would help boost U.S. production in Texas and North Dakota.",41.0,44.0

The astronauts went out on a spacewalk to grease the robot arm's new hand. (NASA TV via AP)  CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Spacewalking astronauts hustled through a lube job and camera swaps outside the International Space Station on Tuesday, their second trip outside in less than a week.  Astronaut Mark Vande Hei made fast work of greasing the big robot arm’s new hand.  Vande Hei and station commander Randy Bresnik replaced the latching mechanism on one end of the 58-foot robot arm last Thursday. The mechanism malfunctioned in August.  Tuesday’s work involved using a grease gun, which resembles a caulking gun, to keep the latching mechanism working smoothly. Vande Hei got a jump ahead in some greasing chores, but the two-part job still will spill into next week, in a third and final spacewalk.  “Why don’t we wash, rinse, repeat. Do it again in a week,” Bresnik said as the 6 ½-hour spacewalk came to a close.  These latches, or hands, are located on each end of the Canadian-built robot arm. They’re used to grab arriving U.S. cargo ships and also allow the robot arm to move around the orbiting lab.  Launched in 2001 with the rest of the robot arm, the original latches were showing their age. NASA plans to replace the latching mechanism on the opposite end of the arm early next year.  Vande Hei and Bresnik also replaced several camera assemblies at the 250-mile-high outpost.  “What do you do for an encore?” Bresnik asked Vande Hei, after two successful spacewalks.  “I finish six months on the space station,” Vande Hei replied. He arrived a month ago.  Vande Hei will sit out the next spacewalk on Oct. 18. Instead, Bresnik will be accompanied by Joe Acaba, a teacher-turned-astronaut.  Six men live at the orbiting lab: three Americans, two Russians and one Italian. As the space station approached Italy early in the spacewalk, Mission Control urged Bresnik and Vande Hei to take some photos for their crewmate, Paolo Nespoli.",1.0,2.0

A preliminary hearing for Sharif opened Tuesday but was recessed so he can find a lawyer. He appeared on closed-circuit television and followed proceedings with the help of an interpreter.

1070,2648,10,27,2017,2017-10-27,Vox,Scotland may ban spanking. Decades of research suggests that’s a good idea.,"Last week, a member of the Scottish Parliament introduced legislation that would make spanking a crime on par with assault. And the Scottish National Party, which controls the Scottish Parliament, has pledged to make it law sometime early in 2018, Scotland’s national newspaper reports.  When that happens, Scotland will join a growing list of counties, states, and municipalities that have made hitting children illegal. Since Sweden became the first country to ban corporeal punishment in 1979, 51 other countries have adopted similar laws. (The United States is not among them.)  Current law in Scotland (and in the UK at large) allows for “reasonable chastisement” (yes, it’s vague) when it comes to disciplining kids. This new legislation would make Scotland the first UK country to turn that gray area into a fine black line.  “Giving children equal protection against assault will send a clear message to all of us about how we treat each other and underpin Scotland’s efforts to reduce violence,” John Finnie, the member of the Scottish Parliament who introduced the law, told reporters.  Opponents say that spanking — generally defined as hitting a child with an open hand on the behind — leads to a slippery slope of abuse and can cause emotional and behavioral problems down the line. The question of whether mild spanking definitely causes problems is hard to answer. (You can’t exactly run an experiment that involves hitting children.)  Here’s the state of the science. There’s not a lot of evidence that spanking provides a benefit to kids. And there’s some (controversial and contested) evidence that it can actually lead to harm.  The state of the science on spanking  In a 2016 meta-analysis in the Journal of Family Psychology, psychologists Elizabeth Gershoff and Andrew Grogan-Kaylor sifted through 75 studies on spanking, excluding research that analyzed other forms of physical punishment and abuse, such as hitting children with objects. The studies employed either cross-sectional (i.e., snapshot) or longitudinal (over the span of several years) designs. In all, the resulting data pool contained information on 161,000 children. It found “no evidence that spanking is associated with improved child behavior.”  The analysis found evidence that spanking is associated with troubling outcomes — like increased aggression, increased antisocial behavior, and mental health problems later in life. According to Gershoff, spanking “makes it clear to the children that you can hit somebody if you have power.” And that lesson sticks with a kid, making them act out later in life.  There are a lot of big caveats to mention here.  The size of these negative effects is small, the study notes, and there's no proof that spanking specifically caused these behaviors later in life. So it’s hard to tell if spanking leaves a lasting scar.  And the evidence in the broader literature is mixed. A 2013 meta-review on corporal punishment in kids found “trivial” correlations with negative outcomes. But a 2017 analysis in the journal Child Abuse & Neglect found in a correlational study that spanking was linked to similar adverse effects as childhood emotional abuse.  The research is not perfectly clear because behaviors like spanking are some of the hardest for social scientists to study and draw concrete conclusions from.  For one, researchers can't conduct spanking experiments where they randomly assign children to be hit. They also have to lean on questionnaires, where parents or children have to remember how punishments were administered.  There’s also the case that ""bad"" children are just spanked more, and are also generally more aggressive and antisocial throughout their lives. And even though this meta-analysis singled out studies only about spanking, it’s still possible the parents in these studies were also using harsher forms of punishment (like hitting children with objects) and didn’t mention it to the researchers.  Overall, when studying real-world behaviors like spanking, it’s very hard, if not impossible, to truly isolate the variable and study its absolute effect on behavior.  “Gershoff and Grogan-Kaylor’s most recent meta-analysis relies on correlational evidence that would be considered woefully inadequate in any other scientific field,” the American College of Pediatricians wrote in an scathing editorial bashing the meta-review. They said that “studies would be rejected if they were being used to halt a medical procedure, such as chemotherapy for combating cancer.” To reiterate: You just can’t study spanking like you could a drug.  The editorial noted only four of the studies limited the definition of spanking to “two open-handed swats to the buttocks for child defiance.” The other studies left the term “spanking” a bit more open to interpretation: They could mean smacks anywhere on the body. Then again, parents who hit their children might not be mindful of these differing definitions, or may use them interchangeably.  Bob Larzelere, the Oklahoma State University family science researcher who co-authored the College of Pediatricians editorial, says in an email that there are a few studies that show something called “conditional spanking,” where children only get spanked if they ignore another mild discipline (like a time out) may be effective in getting children to cooperate. Though the research on this disciplinary technique is unclear as to whether mild “conditional” spanking leads to a slippery slope of increasing violence, or whether it has long-term consequences for a child’s well-being.  At the very least, the 2016 meta-study makes a case that spanking doesn't lead to any long-term measurable good. Only one study of the 75 studies found an effect linking spanking to a positive life outcome. “If — in the real world — spanking was good for kids, some of these studies should have found that,” Gershoff told Vox in 2016.  Why parents spank  In 2016, I spoke with Gershoff in depth about her research. And I asked her why we assume spanking could be a helpful disciplinary strategy. “One is parents think it works,” she said. “And they think it works because it gets an immediate reaction out of the child. Immediately the child cries. The parent goes ""Aha! they understood that I am mad."" That’s gratifying to the parent, so the parent is rewarded by getting this reaction out of the child.”  The other reason: Parents themselves were spanked themselves as children, and are continuing the practice. But Gershoff didn’t think parents today should necessarily feel guilty for spanking their kids.  “We know now that children need to be in carseats and seat belts,” she said. “But those of us who grew up in the 1970s were in cars that didn't even have seat belts. Do I think my parents were bad parents for not putting me in a seat belt? No, because no one understood how important seat belts were.”  Even if the effect of spanking is null — not positive or negative — why should (however mildly) violent actions be condoned? The world over, children are routinely the subjects of violent abuse; the United Nations finds domestic violence is a leading cause of children’s deaths worldwide. And many argue that spanking is the first step on a continuum of violence. If a hand slap is good, why isn’t a rod better? It’s a dangerous slippery slope.",14.0,9.0
91,524,6,21,2017,2017-06-21,Vox,Uber CEO Travis Kalanick is quitting. His successor will face big challenges.,"Travis Kalanick has resigned as Uber’s CEO under pressure from five of the company’s biggest investors, the New York Times reports.  The announcement caps a tumultuous six months in which Uber suffered a seemingly endless string of scandals and controversies. They culminated last week with a report by attorney general Eric Holder that found systematic problems with workplace sexism. In the wake of that report, Uber fired one of its top executives, Emil Michaels. And Kalanick himself agreed to take a leave of absence from the company, leaving the company under the control of a committee of Kalanick subordinates.  But hardly anyone was satisfied with that outcome. As I argued on Monday, it left Uber rudderless at a time when it desperately needed decisive leadership. The company has several of its top jobs unfilled, and it would have been difficult to recruit strong candidates without an active CEO.  Investors evidently felt the same way. According to the New York Times, five of Uber’s biggest investors sent Kalanick a letter on Tuesday demanding that he step down as CEO. The investors who signed the letter control about 40 percent of the company’s voting power — less than the majority they’d need to oust him, but enough that Kalanick couldn’t ignore their concerns.  “I love Uber more than anything in the world and at this difficult moment in my personal life I have accepted the investors request to step aside so that Uber can go back to building rather than be distracted with another fight,” Kalanick said in a statement to the Times.  Now Uber needs to find a new, permanent chief executive. As a major Uber shareholder, Kalanick is likely to continue wielding significant influence from the sidelines. But it’ll be important that the company’s new chief executive be truly independent so that he or she can credibly promise to change Uber’s culture and start to put its many scandals behind it.  Uber’s new CEO will face big challenges  Since the start of 2017, Uber has faced a number of major controversies:  In February, a former Uber engineer named Susan Fowler wrote a blog post alleging that she had experienced multiple incidents of sexual harassment and discrimination at Uber. She said that the company’s human resources department had done little to address the problems, and that other women have had similar experiences. The company asked an independent panel led by former attorney general Eric Holder to look into Fowler’s allegations. Holder delivered his findings to Uber’s board last week, confirming that Uber had a significant problem and ultimately precipitating Kalanick’s resignation.  alleging that she had experienced multiple incidents of sexual harassment and discrimination at Uber.

Holder delivered his findings to Uber’s board last week, confirming that Uber had a significant problem and ultimately precipitating Kalanick’s resignation. Uber is facing a federal criminal investigation over “Greyball,” software designed to mislead local regulators in order to prevent them from enforcing municipal taxi regulations. Uber reasoned that if city officials couldn’t identify Uber cars, they couldn’t write Uber drivers tickets for operating unlicensed taxi services. So it identified accounts belonging to government officials and provided them with a version of the Uber app that showed fake information and wasn’t able to actually summon Uber cars.  Uber was sued by Waymo, Google’s self-driving car unit, for allegedly stealing technical details for a key Waymo-designed sensor. Last month Uber was forced to fire Anthony Levandowski , a star engineer who left Waymo last year and started a self-driving truck company that Uber bought for around $700 million. Levandowski was fired after he invoked the Fifth Amendment rather than turn over documents he allegedly stole from Waymo. The judge has also referred the case to federal prosecutors .  , a star engineer who left Waymo last year and started a self-driving truck company that Uber bought for around $700 million. Levandowski was fired after he invoked the Fifth Amendment rather than turn over documents he allegedly stole from Waymo. The judge has also . In January, Uber agreed to pay $20 million to settle Federal Trade Commission allegations that it had overstated likely driver earnings. In May, the company admitted it had miscalculated driver pay in the New York area, costing thousands of drivers an average of $900 each. A February video showed Kalanick lecturing a driver about “responsibility” after the driver complained about declining fares — prompting Kalanick to publicly apologize. “To say that I am ashamed is an extreme understatement,” he wrote.  Looming on top of all that is Uber’s challenging business situation. The ride-hailing company lost $2.8 billion in 2016 and another $708 million in the first three months of 2017.  And there’s a real danger that Waymo, Tesla, or another rival could develop fully self-driving technology before Uber, which Kalanick himself has described as an existential threat to the company.  ""If we are not tied for first, then the person who is in first, or the entity that's in first, then rolls out a ride-sharing network that is far cheaper or far higher-quality than Uber's, then Uber is no longer a thing,” Kalanick told Business Insider last year.",1.0,2.0
1368,2970,11,3,2017,2017-11-03,Vox,The Senate’s tax plan would cut alcohol taxes. That would be a public health disaster.,"Deep within the latest Republican tax plan in the Senate, there’s a new idea that could literally put lives at risk: The proposal would cut taxes on alcohol.  The alcohol industry has been lobbying for such cuts for years. It’s finally getting what it wanted: The Senate proposal would cut federal alcohol excise taxes by 16 percent by effectively reducing taxes across the board for beer, wine, and liquor over the next two years, according to an analysis by Adam Looney at Brookings.  To many Americans, this might seem like a good idea. It means cheaper booze, after all.  But economists and public health experts argue this would amount to a public health disaster; alcohol is if anything underpriced, they argue, given the external costs that it already carries. Consider: Alcohol is linked to 88,000 deaths each year in the US — making it the third leading cause of preventable death in America after smoking and the combination of poor diet and physical inactivity. And death is only one external cost of alcohol, with others including more crime, car crashes, and reduced economic output. All of this is enabled by cheap alcohol, which makes it easier to drink in excess.  This problem would be made worse by Congress’s tax cuts. Looney analyzes the research on alcohol prices and estimates that “the legislation will cause … approximately 1,550 total alcohol-related deaths annually from all causes.” Since the tax cuts expire after 2019, that amounts to 3,100 more preventable deaths over the next two years — and more if Congress extends the tax cuts further.  From Looney’s perspective, the alcohol tax should actually be higher. For one, Congress has failed to raise federal alcohol taxes, which are separate from state taxes on alcohol, since 1991. (They were increased somewhat regularly before then.) This has already left the taxes in a pretty bad state: As the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) noted in 2016, “current excise tax rates on alcohol are far lower than historical levels when adjusted to include the effects of inflation.”  “The great opportunity we have is to restore taxes to the real value that they had a few decades ago,” Philip Cook, a public policy expert at Duke University who wrote Paying the Tab: The Costs and Benefits of Alcohol Control, previously told me. “That’s justified by the current social costs of drinking, and would have all kinds of beneficial effects, while being justified just from the point of view that drinkers should pay for the damage that they do.”  Congress is not only shirking this opportunity, but it’s actually taking the opposite route. Based on all the research on alcohol taxes, that will lead to more preventable deaths.  How the Senate proposal would cut alcohol taxes  The current Senate tax plan would make several big changes to alcohol taxes, which are broadly separated between beer, distilled spirits (liquor), and wine:  It would cut the per-barrel tax for beer from $18 to $16 for the first 6 million barrels that brewers produce or import, with anything beyond that still taxed at $18. And for small domestic brewers, the rate would be cut from $7 to $3.50 for the first 60,000 barrels and $16 beyond that.  It would enact a tiered system for distilled spirits. Today, distilled spirits are taxed at $13.50 per proof gallon. Under the proposal, they would be taxed at $2.70 per proof gallon for the first 100,000 gallons produced or imported, $13.34 for above 100,000 and up to about 22.1 million gallons, and the current $13.50 rate beyond that.  It would give producers and importers greater access to a wine tax credit.  It would eliminate some other regulations on alcohol.  The tax cuts would last through 2019, but Congress could extend them at any point.  The tax cuts are aimed at supposedly helping small producers. But Looney of Brookings argues that, based on his analysis, “the benefits will accrue to producers across the board, providing windfalls to the large oligopolies that dominate the beer, wine, and spirits industry — and to foreign producers.”  The changes would also create a potential loophole for large producers, particularly foreign ones that are more difficult for US law enforcement officials to oversee and regulate. Looney gives an example: “For instance, a large French producer who would not otherwise qualify for the lower rates could divide its production among multiple labels or multiple importers, each below the 250,000 bottle limit, evading the tax and producing a comparative advantage for the foreign producer over the American producer.”  The changes need approval from the House, Senate, and White House. It’s unclear what the tax plan’s chances of passing — much less this particular part of the plan — are.  Congress could raise the alcohol tax instead  Instead of cutting alcohol taxes, Congress could consider raising them. In fact, there’s a plan out there that already explains how this could work.  The CBO routinely releases a report called “Options for Reducing the Deficit.” As part of this, it analyzes the possibility of raising the federal government’s alcohol excise taxes.  In the 2016 report, the CBO looked at what would happen if excise taxes were raised to $16 per proof gallon for all alcoholic beverages, along with the elimination of tax credits for small producers and exemptions for personal use. It found that this would raise $70.4 billion over 10 years.  How? First, it would help level taxes between different kinds of alcoholic beverages. As the CBO explained, “the alcohol content of beer and wine is taxed at a much lower rate than the alcohol content of distilled spirits in part because the taxes are determined on the basis of different liquid measures.” This leads to big disparities:  Distilled spirits are measured in proof gallons, which denote a liquid gallon that is 50 percent alcohol by volume. The current excise tax levied on those spirits, $13.50 per proof gallon, translates to about 21 cents per ounce of pure alcohol. Beer, by contrast, is measured by the barrel, and the current tax rate of $18 per barrel translates to about 10 cents per ounce of pure alcohol (under the assumption that the alcohol content of the beer is 4.5 percent). The current levy on table wine is $1.07 per gallon, or about 6 cents per ounce of pure alcohol (assuming an alcohol content of 13 percent). Wines with high volumes of alcohol, and sparkling wines, face a higher tax per gallon.  A $16 per proof gallon tax for all alcoholic beverages, along with the elimination of related tax credits and exemptions, would level the playing field.  It would also increase alcohol taxes across the board, the CBO found: “Under this option, the federal excise tax on a 750-milliliter bottle (commonly referred to as a fifth) of distilled spirits would rise from about $2.14 to $2.54. The tax on a six-pack of beer at 4.5 percent alcohol by volume would jump from about 33 cents to 81 cents, and the tax on a 750-milliliter bottle of wine with 13 percent alcohol by volume would increase from about 21 cents to 82 cents.”  This is just one idea for raising alcohol taxes. Some experts would like to see taxes raised by more or less. But since the CBO has actually reviewed this proposal, it offers a useful starting point — one that would raise $70.4 billion over 10 years.  An alcohol tax increase would bring huge gains for public health and safety  Obviously, this means your alcohol will cost more — 40 cents for a fifth of distilled spirits, nearly 50 cents for a six-pack of beer, and more than 60 cents for a typical bottle of wine.  “What the hell, man?” you might be thinking. “Why do you want the government all over my booze?”  The simple answer: It would save lives.  Raising alcohol taxes would increase the price of alcohol, which would make drinking more expensive, which would make people less likely to excessively drink. So fewer people would be getting drunk and doing the kinds of dumb things people do while drunk. That includes not just drunk driving but other alcohol-related problems like crime — 40 percent of violent crimes in the US involve alcohol in some way — and risky sex.  “It’s a disinhibition theory,” Charles Branas, a researcher at Columbia University, previously told me. “So it’s not so much aggressiveness, but that decisions and judgment that would normally be held in check are suddenly disinhibited under consumption of alcohol.”  One question with this is, well, does it work? Sure, you can increase the tax and make alcohol cost more. But does that actually get people to drink less?  The research shows a higher alcohol tax not only gets people to drink less, but has a particular impact on excessive drinking and its negative outcomes.  The Task Force on Community Preventive Services in 2010 reviewed the research on alcohol’s “price elasticity,” which is how much consumption changes with price. The results were clear: “Nearly all studies, including those with different study designs, found that there was an inverse relationship between the tax or price of alcohol and indices of excessive drinking or alcohol-related health outcomes. Among studies restricted to underage populations, most found that increased taxes were also signifıcantly associated with reduced consumption and alcohol-related harms.”  This chart shows the findings, with each number representing the percentage effect on excess consumption for every 1 percent increase in the price of alcohol:  There’s a simple explanation for why higher alcohol taxes are effective for reducing excessive drinking in particular: If someone is only buying a six-pack of beer or one bottle of wine a week, then a price increase of 50 or 60 cents probably won’t mean much. But as someone buys more and more, that extra cost builds up — and eventually becomes inhibitive.  Other research backs up the idea. David Roodman, a senior adviser for the Open Philanthropy Project, has conducted really thorough, impressive reviews of the research, from the effects of incarceration on crime to the domestic economic impacts of immigration. He also in 2015 took a look at the research on the alcohol tax. His findings were incredible (emphasis mine):  The literature on this topic is large, and at first glance it seemed that the high-quality studies contradicted each other. Yet as I dug deeper, I found a pattern: the larger the experiment — the larger the price change — the clearer the effects. In the end, I believe the preponderance of the evidence says that higher prices do correlate with less drinking and lower incidence of problems such as cirrhosis deaths. And I see little reason to doubt the obvious explanation: higher prices cause less drinking. A rough rule of thumb is that each 1% increase in alcohol price reduces drinking by 0.5%. Extrapolating from some of the most powerful studies, I estimate an even larger impact on the death rate from alcohol-caused diseases: 1-3% within months. By extension, a 10% price increase would cut the death rate 9-25%. For the US in 2010, this represents 2,000-6,000 averted deaths/year.  To put it another way, paying about 50 cents more for a six-pack of Bud Light would probably save thousands of lives every single year.  This is a conservative estimate. It only counts deaths from alcohol-caused diseases. The number of saved lives would be higher if it accounted for alcohol-related deaths due to violence, car crashes, and other problems.  And yes, a higher alcohol tax would have an effect in those other areas as well. A 2010 review of the research in the American Journal of Public Health, for example, concluded, “Our results suggest that doubling the alcohol tax would reduce alcohol-related mortality by an average of 35%, traffic crash deaths by 11%, sexually transmitted disease by 6%, violence by 2%, and crime by 1.4%.”  In short, higher alcohol prices — and taxes — really do reduce alcohol-related problems, including heavy drinking and underage consumption.  A common counterargument is that higher alcohol taxes could lead to job losses, since the alcohol industry may be forced to fire workers or hire fewer people to make up for the profits lost as a result of the taxes and as people cut back on their drinking. But studies and researchers have found that the revenue from the taxes and the spending shift from alcohol to non-alcohol products can lead to, on net, more jobs.  But even if higher alcohol taxes lead to fewer jobs in some cases, they could still be worth it. Jobs aren’t everything; public health and safety matter too.  By simply raising alcohol taxes, America could save lives, combat crime, and slow the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. That does mean you’ll have to pay a bit more at the checkout line next time you buy your favorite chardonnay, or maybe you’ll have to pass on the chardonnay altogether — but the research suggests it’d be worth the cost.",7.0,10.0
1610,3347,11,12,2017,2017-11-12,Breitbart,EXCLUSIVE – Mother of Roy Moore Accuser Contradicts Key Detail of Daughter’s Sexual Misconduct Story," The mother of Leigh Corfman, who says that Alabama Senatorial Candidate Roy Moore tried to engage in a sexual encounter with her when she was 14, has contradicted a key detail of Corfman’s story.  Speaking by phone to Breitbart News on Saturday, Corfman’s mother, Nancy Wells, 71, says that her daughter did not have a phone in her bedroom during the period that Moore is reported to have allegedly called Corfman – purportedly on Corfman’s bedroom phone – to arrange at least one encounter.  Moore strongly denies Corfman’s claims.  The Washington Post, which first published its newsmaking, on-the-record interview with Corfman last week, cited Corfman as remembering that she provided Moore with her number when she was 14. She said that she spoke to Moore from what she described as the phone in her bedroom.  Citing Corfman, the Post reported:  After her mother went into the courtroom, Corfman says, Moore asked her where she went to school, what she liked to do and whether he could call her sometime. She remembers giving him her number and says he called not long after. She says she talked to Moore on her phone in her bedroom, and they made plans for him to pick her up at Alcott Road and Riley Street, around the corner from her house.  Soon after, Corfman said, he called again, and picked her up again at the same spot.  Later on, Corfman described a third phone call:  She says that after their last encounter, Moore called again, but that she found an excuse to avoid seeing him. She says that at some point during or soon after her meetings with Moore, she told two friends in vague terms that she was seeing an older man.  Corfman clearly claimed she spoke to Moore on what she said was “her phone in her bedroom” on at least one of those occasions. The Post did not specify whether the second or third alleged calls purportedly took place on a bedroom phone.  Wells, Corfman’s mother, was asked by Breitbart News: “Back then did she have her own phone in her room or something?”  “No,” she replied matter-of-factly. “But the phone in the house could get through to her easily.”  The Post story relies heavily on Corfman’s memory and her ability to recount events consistently.  The newspaper reported that “Corfman described her story consistently in six interviews with The Post.”  The Post story uses the word “remembers” 10 times when quoting or paraphrasing Corfman.  Here are those 10 times:  1: The Post cited Corfman thusly: “’I wanted it over with — I wanted out,’ she remembers thinking.”  This detail related to Corfman’s claim that Moore drove her to his house, removed his own clothes besides his underwear, took off her shirt and guided her hand to his underwear.  2: During the initial alleged encounter, when Corfman said that Moore was watching her while Corfman’s mother went into the courtroom, the Post reported, “She remembers giving him her number and says he called not long after.”  3: “I remember the further I got from my house, the more nervous I got,” Corfman was quoted as saying when she recalled the alleged drive with Moore from her house.  5 – 7: The Post used the word three times when citing Corfman in the following paragraph:  She remembers an unpaved driveway. She remembers going inside and him giving her alcohol on this visit or the next, and that at some point she told him she was 14. She says they sat and talked. She remembers that Moore told her she was pretty, put his arm around her and kissed her, and that she began to feel nervous and asked him to take her home, which she says he did.  8 – Referring to the alleged sexual encounter, the Post reported:  She remembers that Moore kissed her, that he took off her pants and shirt, and that he touched her through her bra and underpants. She says that he guided her hand to his underwear and that she yanked her hand back.  9 – In that same encounter, the Post relates:  She remembers thinking, “I don’t want to do this” and “I need to get out of here.” She says that she got dressed and asked Moore to take her home, and that he did.  Meanwhile, Wells told Breitbart that she and her daughter stick by the Post’s story. “It’s truthful and it was researched very well,” she said.  Asked if she could remember Moore, then a 32-year-old assistant district attorney, allegedly asking to watch her daughter in 1979 while Wells went into a courtroom, Wells recounted the story essentially the same way she told it to the Post.  Wells told this reporter: “We were sitting in the hall. He came up and started talking to us. We were sitting on a bench waiting to go into court. He said, you know, ‘What are you doing.’ You know, we told him. He is Roy Moore. And he said, ‘You don’t want her to go in there and hear all of the bickering.’ And I said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘I will be glad to stay out here with her and bring her in if she needs to come in.’ And so that is the way it started.”  “Probably if it were in today’s times that never would have happened,” Wells added. “He sounded like someone that I could trust and we were there in the courthouse.”  Corfman described her own troubled background to the Post, including three divorces, bankruptcies and a history of drug abuse.  The Post related:  She says that her teenage life became increasingly reckless with drinking, drugs, boyfriends, and a suicide attempt when she was 16. As the years went on, Corfman says, she did not share her story about Moore partly because of the trouble in her life. She has had three divorces and financial problems. While living in Arizona, she and her second husband started a screen-printing business that fell into debt. They filed for bankruptcy protection three times, once in 1991 with $139,689 in unpaid claims brought by the Internal Revenue Service and other creditors, according to court records.  Moore strongly denied Corfman’s claims. “These allegations are completely false and are a desperate political attack by the National Democrat Party and the Washington Post on this campaign,” Moore said in immediate response to the Post’s story.  Moore’s campaign said in a statement, “This garbage is the very definition of fake news and intentional defamation.”  The campaign pointed out that Moore has been married to his wife, Kayla, for nearly 33 years and has four children and five grandchildren. It also noted that Moore has served in public office in the past and that no such allegations were previously made.  The statement said:  The Judge has been a candidate in four hotly-contested statewide political contests, twice as a gubernatorial candidate and twice as a candidate for chief justice. He has been a three-time candidate for local office, and he has been a national figure in two ground-breaking, judicial fights over religious liberty and traditional marriage.  “After over 40 years of public service, if any of these allegations were true, they surely would have been made public long before now,” the statement continued.  On Saturday, Moore further addressed the allegations:  “Now I want to address something that some people have come here to hear about,” Moore said at a local campaign event. “Shortly after becoming the Republican nominee for the United States Senate, the Washington Post began an attack on the Foundation for Moral Law, on my wife, and on me. For weeks, we read about my salary which they distorted, about taxes where they said we were paid money we never got. But we endured that.”  “Later, they came out and endorsed my opponent in this race,” he continued. “Just two days ago, the Washington Post published yet another attack on my character and reputation in a desperate attempt to stop my political campaign for the United States Senate. These attacks about a minor are completely false and untrue about something that happened nearly 40 years ago. But more than being completely false and untrue, they are very hurtful to me personally.”  “I wanted to make it clear to the media present and the people present, I have not provided alcoholic beverages—beer or anything else—to a minor. I have not been guilty of sexual misconduct with anyone,” he declared. “These allegations came only four and a half weeks before the general election on Dec. 12. Why now?”  “For forty years I have been closely scrutinized in the press and the public media. I have had investigations by the attorney general, I’ve had investigations by the judicial inquiry commission on more than one occasion, I’ve had investigations by the court of the judiciary, I’ve been in five statewide campaigns in which they do opposition research—they do investigations, as you can see in every one I’ve ever run—and three county elections and two major controversies over religious liberty and the Ten Commandments and same-sex marriage,” he continued. “I’ve been investigated more than any other person in this country. That grown women would wait forty years to come right before an election to bring charges is absolutely unbelievable.”  Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

547,1939,10,13,2017,2017-10-13,Associated Press News,Birds gone wild: Resurgent turkeys spar with human neighbors,"In this Sept. 27, 2017 photo, a wild turkey walks through a residential neighborhood in Brookline, Mass. Wild turkeys have bounced back in New England in what's considered a success story for wildlife restoration. But as they spread farther into urban areas, they're increasingly coming into conflict with humans who say they ravage gardens, damage cars and attack people. (AP Photo/Collin Binkley)  BOSTON (AP) — Not everyone is celebrating the return of the wild turkeys.  After being wiped out from New England in the 1800s, the birds have stormed back in what’s considered a major success story for wildlife restoration. But as they spread farther into urban areas, they’re increasingly clashing with residents who say they destroy gardens, damage cars, chase pets and attack people.  Complaints about troublesome turkeys have surged in Boston and its suburbs over the past three years, causing headaches for police and health officials called to handle problems, according to city and town records provided to The Associated Press. It’s a familiar dilemma for some other U.S. towns from coast to coast that have been overrun by turkeys in recent years.  Boston city officials say they received at least 60 complaints last year, a threefold increase over the year before. Nearby Somerville, Belmont and Brookline have seen similar upticks, combining for a total of 137 turkey gripes since the start of last year.  “Several years ago it was more of an isolated situation here and there,” said David Scarpitti, the wild turkey and upland game biologist for the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife. “Now it’s starting to spread into communities all around Boston.”  Wild turkeys are increasingly clashing with their human neighbors as they spread out into urban areas. New England's turkey population has rebounded, but some residents complain that the birds ruin gardens, damage cars and even attack people. (Oct. 13)  Often the grievance is little more than a wayward turkey blocking traffic, but in at least five cases turkeys became so aggressive that police said they had to shoot them as a matter of public safety. Some area residents have suffered minor injuries from the birds, including a 72-year-old woman who told police she was bruised in August after a gang of turkeys scratched and pecked her during a walk.  Turkeys in the wild are far stronger and faster than the ones that land on Thanksgiving tables, experts say. Males in particular are driven to show physical aggression as a way to climb the social pecking order, and they sometimes view humans as potential competitors.  “Turkeys don’t really mean to harm people — it’s just tied to their social dynamics within the flock,” Scarpitti said. “They lose perspective that humans are humans and turkeys are turkeys. They just want to assert dominance over anything.”  Even the earliest Americans picked up on that characteristic, with Ben Franklin famously writing that the turkey is a “Bird of Courage, and would not hesitate to attack a Grenadier of the British Guards who should presume to invade his Farm Yard with a red Coat on.”  In the town of Brookline, Tess Bundy has come to loathe the turkeys that roost behind her home and often come charging when she leaves. She called police in April after a big tom repeatedly launched itself at her and her infant daughter, backing down only after Bundy whacked it several times with a shovel.  “They’re terrible. Every year they’re worse,” said Bundy, a history professor at Merrimack College. “I really do think that they’re a menace to the town.”  The complaints have sent some cities searching for answers, including in Cambridge, where the City Council says it’s working on a plan. Officials in Brookline issued new guidance for fowl encounters in August, telling residents to “step toward the turkey and act confidently.”  Wildlife experts say much of the problem can be blamed on residents who leave out food for turkeys, which entices flocks to settle in and helps them survive winters.  Towns with similar problems in New Jersey, Iowa and Oregon have banned turkey feeding in recent years, and Montana enacted a similar statewide ban in May. But the idea hasn’t spread to the Boston area, where some residents say they enjoy the return of native wildlife.  Not far from two sites where turkeys were shot by police, Brookline resident Suzette Abbott says she’s had no problems with the turkeys that roam her block.  “I don’t think they’re dangerous,” Abbott said. “In the spring they look pretty amazing when the males are displaying their colors. I think they’re quite beautiful if you actually look at their feathers.”  ___  Follow Collin Binkley on Twitter: @cbinkley.",5.0,8.0
194,1169,9,21,2017,2017-09-21,Associated Press News,World shares mixed as markets mull latest Fed statement,"People walk past an electronic board showing Hong Kong share index outside a local bank in Hong Kong, Thursday, April 21, 2017. Asian shares were mostly lower and the dollar strengthened Thursday after the Fed said it would start trimming its bond holdings and planned one more interest rate increase this year. (AP Photo/Vincent Yu)  LONDON (AP) — Global stock markets were mixed Thursday as investors digested the latest statements from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which indicated that it remains on course to raise interest rates on several occasions over the coming year.  KEEPING SCORE: In Europe, the FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was unchanged at 7,273 while Germany’s DAX was 0.3 percent higher at 12,612. The CAC 40 in France was 0.5 percent firmer at 5,270. U.S. stocks were poised for a steady opening with Dow futures and the broader S&P 500 futures unchanged.  FED IN FOCUS: At their latest meeting, Fed policymakers kept short-term interest rates unchanged but said they still expect one more increase this year and three in 2018, if persistently low inflation rebounds. Since December 2015, the Fed has modestly raised the rate four times. Rates had previously been cut to a record low after the 2008 financial crisis, helping to fuel a multiyear global stock boom. Officials also said they plan to start unwinding the U.S. central bank’s $4.5 trillion balance sheet next month by reducing its bond holdings, which will gradually increase long-term borrowing rates. The plans were mostly in line with economist expectations.  INVESTOR INSIGHT: “Even now, despite the Fed effectively forecasting four rate hikes before the end of next year, markets are pricing in only one or two and even then, unconvincingly,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA. “Clearly there is still a lot of convincing to do on the Fed’s part, potentially providing in the process plenty of upside for U.S. yields and the dollar.”  DOLLAR SPIKE: The dollar did enjoy a spike on the back of the statement. On Thursday, the euro was flat at $1.1893 having traded above $1.20 on Wednesday, while the dollar was up 0.3 percent at 112.53 yen.  JAPAN ON HOLD: Officials at Japan’s central bank, meanwhile, made no changes to monetary policy, leaving in place stimulus measures to prop up Asia’s No. 2 economy. The decision, which was widely expected, was approved in an 8-1 vote, with one new board member unexpectedly dissenting, saying the measures weren’t aggressive enough.

406,1751,10,8,2017,2017-10-08,Vox,"A mayor in Puerto Rico calls for FEMA help. FEMA's director says he's ""filtering [her] out.""","There’s been sharp criticism of the Trump administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s response to the disaster following Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, not least from Carmen Yulín Cruz, the mayor of San Juan, the territory’s capital and most populous city. ""Increasingly painful to undestand [sic] the american people want to help and US Gov does not want to help. WE NEED WATER!"" Cruz tweeted Sunday morning. Indeed, more than two weeks after the storm made landfall, 43 percent of the island still lacks water access and more than 88 percent lacks electricity. At least 34 people, and likely many more, have died of storm-related causes.  She continued: “Power collapses in San Juan hospital with 4 patients now being transferred out. Have requested support from FEMA. NOTHING! … The Hospital had requested support from FEMA and no response. Oh sorry they are collecting data...”  When ABC News's Martha Raddatz interviewed FEMA Director Brock Long on Sunday, she asked about Cruz's allegations that the agency was falling down on its recovery duties. Long did not appear fazed. Indeed, he appears to not believe the mayor’s concern was worth his or the agency’s time, telling Raddatz, “We filtered out the mayor a long time ago. We don't have time for the political noise.""  .@FEMA_Brock responds to San Juan mayor: ""We filtered out the mayor a long time ago. We don’t have time for the political noise."" #ThisWeek pic.twitter.com/o26LPAEAl8 — This Week (@ThisWeekABC) October 8, 2017  ""If there is a power failure at a hospital, which we've seen two over this past week, we're actually life-flighting the ICU patients out of those hospitals and onto the USNS Comfort,"" a Navy hospital ship currently supporting the island, Long said. Navy press releases confirm the island has received a total of nine critical patients from Puerto Rico hospitals after they experienced power failures.  It’s not clear whether the most recent Navy-reported hospital power failure, on Saturday, is the one Cruz was referring to in her tweets; that evacuation happened at Hospital Menonita in Caguas, about 20 miles from San Juan.  Long’s criticism of Cruz follows in the footsteps of President Trump, who insulted Cruz on Twitter last weekend and on Saturday night told former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee in a TV interview that Cruz “did a very poor job” and was “not a capable person.”  Cruz has a right to be frustrated. Since the vast majority of the island still lacks power, generator failures at hospitals are likely to recur and lives may be lost. Trump dithered in dispatching the USNS Comfort and waiving the Jones Act, which raises the cost of shipping to Puerto Rico (and the Jones waiver expired as of Sunday). As of this writing, Trump still hasn’t authorized the level of infrastructure rebuilding assistance he has for Texas following Hurricane Harvey. And as the administration was overseeing this slow response, the Trump administration briefly removed data on how many Puerto Ricans still lack water and power from FEMA’s website, before restoring it following public pressure.  Long’s comments, however, suggest that the administration is trying to shut out criticism of the response from Cruz and other local Puerto Rican leaders.",37.0,48.0
264,1586,10,4,2017,2017-10-04,Breitbart,Exclusive: Islamic State Jihadist Insists Terror Group Behind Las Vegas Massacre — but Produces No Evidence,"Abu Baker al-Maqdisi, a senior jihadist associated with the Islamic State (ISIS) in the Gaza Strip, insists his terrorist organization was responsible for the Las Vegas massacre, contrary to U.S. law enforcement’s rejection of that claim.  Al-Maqdisi fought within ISIS ranks in Syria and Iraq before returning to his native Gaza Strip.  In an interview with Breitbart Jerusalem, al-Maqdisi repeated the organization’s unsubstantiated claims that Stephen Paddock, the perpetrator of the largest mass shooting attack in U.S. history, was recruited by ISIS when he converted to Islam several months ago. There is no evidence of any such conversion.  “Even the weapons he used in this assault were purchased with Islamic State funds,” al-Maqdisi claimed, without offering any proof and despite Paddock’s reportedly being financially fluid enough to have purchased the weapons himself.  U.S. officials say Paddock, a consummate gambler, bought 33 weapons in the last year. He also wired $100,000 to the Philippines in the days before the shooting, according to a U.S. official speaking to the Associated Press. Paddock’s girlfriend, Marilou Danley, was reportedly in the Philippines at the time of the shooting.  The ISIS claim was first made by Amaq, which serves as the de facto media propaganda arm of IS. Amaq published a series of ISIS statements claiming without any evidence that Paddock was a “soldier of the caliphate” who converted to Islam several months ago and perpetrated the mass shooting “in response to calls to target states of the coalition” battling ISIS.  In another statement, the Islamic State referred to Paddock by the nom de guerre of “Abu Abd al-Bar al-Ameriki.”  The ISIS claims of responsibility have been rejected by the FBI, which said the shooter had no known ISIS connection.  Speaking to Breitbart Jerusalem, Al-Maqdisi claimed that “in spite of Crusader misinformation about IS withdrawing in Iraq and Syria, we are still capable of making” these kinds of attacks.  “There are many more lone wolves inside the U.S who are preparing more attacks. This won’t be the last one.”  Al-Maqdisi claimed, “Never, since the organization got started, has it falsely claimed responsibility for something it didn’t do.”  “What sets the Islamic State organization apart from all the other organizations in the Middle East is the fact that we don’t attribute to ourselves things that we are not responsible for,” added al-Maqdisi. “In addition, we have always proved, including in other events in the U.S., that our claims of responsibility are accurate.”  Maqdisi’s boasts are not entirely true. Amaq does have a fairly good track record when it comes to claims of responsibility. However, as CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank pointed out in a series of tweets, ISIS took credit for two attacks since June for which it was reportedly not responsible.  One ISIS false claim was a deadly casino attack in Manila in June, which turned out to be a robbery attempt, according to local authorities.  Another was the claim that it smuggled weapons into Charles De Gaulle Airport last month, prompting a security alert. It turned out the alert was actually caused by a disgruntled passenger.  ISIS’s false claims come as the terrorist organization has been losing major ground in Iraq and Syria.  Meanwhile, Maqdisi claimed, “The attack in Marseille and the attack in Las Vegas are natural responses to the crimes of these countries against Islam and against the Muslims in Iraq and Syria.”  These attacks will only increase in the coming months,” he said.  He was referring to an attack in Marseille in the south of France in which two women were stabbed to death by a man reportedly yelling, “Allahu akbar,” or “Allah is great” in Arabic, according to witnesses. ISIS claimed responsibility for the carnage via the Amaq News Agency.  “We announced in the past that the Islamic State has cells in America and the entire region of the West, and spectacles like those in Marseille and Las Vegas will continue to be part of the lives of the citizens of the crusader countries.”  Paddock does not fit the typical profile of ISIS jihadis. Typically, it’s young men who profess their allegiance to ISIS, and many have criminal backgrounds. His name was also not listed on databases of suspected terrorists, U.S. authorities said.  As Graeme Wood of the Atlantic noted, we have seen “no cell-phone video from the killer, pledging allegiance in broken Arabic. … Another absent sign of Islamic State involvement is videos from Paddock’s rifle-scope.” He added, “At attacks like the Holey Bakery in Dhaka, Bangladesh, the killers have uploaded real-time images, exclusive and corroborating imagery for Amaq.”  Paddock reportedly set up a video camera inside his hotel room and had another camera in the hallway for surveillance.

1339,2938,11,2,2017,2017-11-02,Associated Press News,Big GOP tax bill would cut rates _ but also popular breaks,"President Donald Trump holds an example of what a new tax form may look like during a meeting on tax policy with Republican lawmakers in the Cabinet Room of the White House, Thursday, Nov. 2, 2017, in Washington, with House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, right. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)  WASHINGTON (AP) — With fanfare and a White House kickoff, House Republicans unfurled a broad tax-overhaul plan Thursday that would touch virtually all Americans and the economy’s every corner, mingling sharply lower rates for corporations and reduced personal taxes for many with fewer deductions for home-buyers and families with steep medical bills.  The measure, which would be the most extensive rewrite of the nation’s tax code in three decades, is the product of a party that faces increasing pressure to produce a marquee legislative victory of some sort before next year’s elections. GOP leaders touted the plan as a sparkplug for the economy and a boon to the middle class and christened it the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  “We are working to give the American people a giant tax cut for Christmas,” President Donald Trump said in the Oval Office. The measure, he said, “will also be tax reform, and it will create jobs.”  It would also increase the national debt, a problem for some Republicans. And Democrats attacked the proposal as the GOP’s latest bonanza for the rich, with a phase-out of the inheritance tax and repeal of the alternative minimum tax on the highest earners — certain to help Trump and members of his family and Cabinet, among others.  House Republicans unveiled a sweeping tax reform bill on Wednesday that promises to cut taxes and simplify the tax code, but also cuts some popular deductions and credits. (Nov. 2)  “If you’re the wealthiest 1 percent, Republicans will give you the sun, the moon and the stars, all of that at the expense of the great middle class,” said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.  And there was enough discontent among Republicans and business groups to leave the legislation’s fate uncertain in a journey through Congress that leaders hope will deposit a landmark bill on Trump’s desk by year’s end.  Underscoring problems ahead, some Republicans from high-tax Northeastern states expressed opposition to the measure’s elimination of the deduction for state and local income taxes. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah called the House measure “a great starting point” but said it would be “somewhat miraculous” if its corporate tax rate reduction to 20 percent — a major Trump goal — survived. His panel plans to produce its own tax package in the coming days.  The House Republicans’ plan, which took them months to craft in countless closed-door meetings, represents the first step in their effort to reverse what’s been a politically disastrous year in Congress. Their drive to obliterate President Barack Obama’s health care law crashed, and GOP lawmakers concede that if the tax measure collapses, their congressional majorities are at risk in next November’s elections.  The package’s tax reductions would outweigh its loophole closers by a massive $1.5 trillion over the coming decade. Many Republicans were willing to add that to the nation’s soaring debt as a price for claiming a resounding tax victory. But it was likely to pose a problem for others — one of several brushfires leaders will need to extinguish to get the measure through Congress.  Republicans must keep their plan’s shortfall from spilling over that $1.5 trillion line or the measure will lose its protection against Democratic Senate filibusters, bill-killing delays that take 60 votes to overcome. There are just 52 GOP senators and unanimous Democratic opposition is likely.  The bill would telescope today’s seven personal income tax brackets into just four: 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent and 39.6 percent.  — The 25 percent rate would start at $45,000 for individuals and $90,000 for married couples.  — The 35 percent rate would apply to family income exceeding $260,000 and individual income over $200,000, which means many upper-income families whose top rate is currently 33 percent would face higher taxes.  — The top rate threshold, now $418,400 for individuals and $470,700 for couples, would rise to $500,000 and $1 million.  The standard deduction — used by people who don’t itemize, around two-thirds of taxpayers — would nearly double to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for couples. That’s expected to encourage even more people to use the standard deduction with a simplified tax form Republicans say will be postcard-sized.  Many middle-income families would pay less, thanks to the bigger standard deduction and an increased child tax credit. Republicans said their plan would save $1,182 in taxes for a family of four earning $59,000, but features like phase-outs of some benefits suggest their taxes could grow in the future.  “The plan clearly chooses corporate CEOs and hedge fund managers over teachers and police officers,” said Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-N.J.  One trade-off for the plan’s reductions was its elimination of breaks that millions have long treasured. Gone would be deductions for people’s medical expenses — especially important for families facing nursing home bills or lacking insurance — and their ability to write off state and local income taxes. The mortgage interest deduction would be limited to the first $500,000 of the loan, down from the current $1 million ceiling.  Led by Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the authors retained the deductibility of up to $10,000 in local property taxes in a bid to line up votes from Republicans from the Northeast. The panel planned to begin votes on the proposal next Monday.  “It’s progress, but I want more,” said Rep. Leonard Lance, R-N.J., who represents one of his state’s wealthier, higher-cost districts and wants the entire property tax deduction restored.  On the business side, the House would drop the top rate for corporations from 35 percent to 20 percent. American companies operating abroad would pay a 10 percent tax on their overseas subsidiaries’ profits. Cash that those firms have amassed abroad but now return home would face a one-time 12 percent tax.  Also reduced to 25 percent would be the rate for many “pass-through” businesses, whose profits are taxed at the owners’ individual rate.  But some of those companies would face higher rates. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said that disparity was “just not acceptable,” and the National Federation of Independent Business said it opposed the bill because it “does not help most small businesses.”  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce praised the measure but said “a lot of work remains to be done.” The group’s chief policy officer, Neil Bradley, said pass-throughs were one concern.  ___  AP reporters Andrew Taylor, Zeke Miller and Kevin Freking in Washington and Mike Catalini in Trenton, New Jersey, contributed.  ___  This story has been corrected to say 52 GOP senators, not 50.",52.0,38.0

301,1635,10,5,2017,2017-10-05,Vox,Why marriages succeed — or fail,"“You complete me.”  Everyone knows that line from the movie Jerry Maguire in which Tom Cruise, the vain but likable sports agent, sweeps Renée Zellweger, his quirky assistant, off her feet. It’s a pithy line, no doubt, but it always struck me as wrongheaded.  Is love really about self-completion? Is marriage about self-fulfillment?  Eli Finkel, a psychology professor at Northwestern University, has just published a book addressing these questions. Titled The All-or-Nothing Marriage: How the Best Marriages Work, the book explores why good marriages are good and why bad marriages are bad.  I sat down with Finkel to talk about what Americans tend to get wrong about marriage and, more importantly, what we can do to get better at it. A lot of it, he said, comes down to expectations.  “We're welcome to ask as much or as little as we want from our marriage,” he told me, “but we better make sure that our expectations are calibrated to what the marriage can realistically provide.”  And what can marriages realistically provide? Well, it depends. For Finkel, it’s fine to look at marriage as a means to personal happiness, but it’s a “two-way street.” It’s about giving as much as it is getting, and forgetting that is the surest way to let your marriage fall apart.  Our conversation, lightly edited for clarity, appears below.  Sean Illing  What makes good marriages good?  Eli Finkel  That we bring significant expectations to them, and they meet those expectations.  Sean Illing  Do you think we expect too much from marriages?  Eli Finkel  I think the question of whether we're asking too much or too little can't be answered in isolation. If I had to answer that with a yes or no, I would say ""No."" But the more accurate way of answering that question is: We're welcome to ask as much or as little as we want from our marriage, but we better make sure that our expectations are calibrated to what the marriage can realistically provide.  Sean Illing  What can marriages realistically provide?  Eli Finkel  It depends. You and I are going to have a particular way of connecting and an array of areas where we're compatible and incompatible, but if I were married to a different person, I would have a different array of characteristics where we're compatible and incompatible. The idea is to learn about yourself, learn about your partner, learn about the dynamics between the two of you, and then calibrate your expectations appropriately.  Sean Illing  What makes bad marriages bad?  Eli Finkel  That we're looking for it to do things that it can't do for us. We want our marriage to make us feel loved, to help us become better people, to provide sexual fulfillment several times a week. And when the marriage fails to do all of these things all of the time, we become resentful, angry, and distant.  “You're lucky to have married into an era that has the best marriages we've ever seen. If you want to try to achieve one of those sorts of marriages, try not to do it on the cheap.”  Sean Illing  You say that the institution of marriage has changed a lot over time, and that we’re asking less and less of it. Is that a good thing?  Eli Finkel  Well, I wouldn’t necessarily say we’re asking less of it. We're asking less when it comes to things at the bottom of Maslow's hierarchy of needs — basic things like security and safety. What I think we don't really appreciate these days is that 200 years ago, people literally looked to marriage for food, clothing, and shelter. It was precarious to live if you weren’t married. We need marriage less in those ways than we did before. Our expectations are lower in those ways, but they're higher in emotional and psychological sorts of ways.  Today, the basic needs of life aren’t enough. These days love and belonging isn’t even enough. Now we want a sense of personal growth, personal betterment, from our marriage.  Sean Illing  You mentioned Maslow there, and I’m sure you noticed David Brooks’s column in the New York Times last week where he claimed you conceive of marriage within the “Maslow frame,” meaning you think marriages exist to help each person self-actualize. Is that right?  Eli Finkel  Well, I think Brooks misunderstands what Maslow meant by the term “self-actualize.” Self-actualization doesn't mean selfish. It means that you're trying to build a meaningful, purposeful life. A central way through which most of us do that is to dedicate ourselves to something bigger than the self. I don't know that there's actually that much difference between the framework that Brooks presents and the Maslovian framework as I understand it.  A lot of people self-actualize through the subjugation of self. That's how they do it. They try to make the world a better place. They go to impoverished parts of the world or they massage cancer patients' feet or they look after the needy. That is a way of self-actualizing, and that's totally consistent with Brooks's view.  Where I disagree with Brooks is I think he's specific about there being a set path that we should follow to achieve the highest height of happiness or whatever his language is. Whereas Maslow would say, ""No, there are many ways we can achieve ultimate happiness and not all of them are self-involved, and in fact the most meaningful ones are the opposite of self-involved.  Sean Illing  I’ve always objected to this idea that the best wife or husband is the one who helps you become the best version of yourself. I think the best partner is the one who helps you transcend yourself, who draws you out of yourself. I guess that’s why I always hated that line from Jerry Maguire, “You complete me.” To me that’s narcissism, not love.  Eli Finkel  I agree! I would say that the Maslovian perspective isn't the Jerry Maguire perspective because ""you complete me"" suggests that there is a void that has to be filled — that I have a void in me and that I need somebody else to fill it. I actually think that is sometimes the opposite of what I'm talking about or what Maslow might be talking about.  We have goals, we have aspirations. We're reasonably proud of who we are, but we can think of ways that we can be better, more ambitious, more energetic, or maybe better at relaxing. We're trying to achieve those goals, and the reality is that humans aren't individual, isolated goal-pursuers. Our social relationships have profound influence on the extent to which we get closer to versus further from our ideal self.  The best marriages these days take that seriously. They take the responsibility for trying to help each other grow and live authentic lives to an extent that would have seemed bizarre in 1950.  “You're welcome to ask for as much as you want of the marriage, but you need to make sure that the marriage can actually achieve those things”  Sean Illing  I like the idea of love as a practice that takes our attention away from ourselves — away from our needs, away from our petty desires, away from our impulses. I understand the egoistic accounts of love, but I think they’re describing something other than love, and hopefully something other than marriage.  Eli Finkel  I love that. Remember that the modern marriage is not just about what I get; it's also, and more importantly, about what I give. We're looking for a marriage to help us with our self-expression and personal growth. I believe that the majority of us have an understanding that that's a two-way street.  Sean Illing  How much success in marriage hinges on choosing the right partner and how much of it hinges on laziness and a failure to tend to the relationship?  Eli Finkel  I don't think anyone knows the answer. But it’s a great question. I think that science has not been very good at defining what compatible actually means. I try to do this better in the book, and I’m convinced that any relationship can be better than it is.  I try to develop evidence-based strategies in the book for making our marriages stronger. But just because any marriage can be better does not mean every marriage is a good idea or that every marriage should persist.  I do think that sometimes people get divorced and end up happier because of it, and that’s probably not very rare. Or people often get divorced and meet someone else that makes them happier. So I wouldn’t tell people to “stick it out” if they’re miserable in their marriage.  On the other hand, there's something pretty great about building and sustaining a long-term marriage, growing old together, watching your kids have kids. I don't have an answer to your question other than to suggest that people should work hard to try to make the marriage as strong as possible, and if there comes a point where they say, ""We do nothing but work. It's just nothing but work, and it's not fulfilling,"" then they might need to consider plan B.  Sean Illing  How do you know when a marriage has failed? When the effort required to sustain it is no longer worth it?  Eli Finkel  Dude, you’re asking great questions that are beyond the science. That is to say that nobody has dealt with this in a way that I feel comfortable with pointing you to a study.  I think a reasonably good metric is something like this: We’ve spent years really trying to make the marriage work. Both of us have tried, and we don't seem to be able to get aligned. The issue at this point seems to be less about good will and effort, and more about a fundamental incompatibility. That is, the life you want to lead is incompatible with the life that I want to lead. That's when I think people should seriously consider that they might be better off apart.  “The idea is to learn about yourself, learn about your partner, learn about the dynamics between the two of you, and then calibrate your expectations appropriately”  Sean Illing  So what are the tools you recommend for getting better at marriage?  Eli Finkel  I talk a lot about calibrating expectations to what the marriage can realistically provide. In some sense, it's basically a modified supply and demand perspective. It says you're welcome to ask for as much as you want of the marriage, but you need to make sure that the marriage can actually achieve those things. That the marriage can supply enough to meet the demand. When I say supply, I'm talking about, yes, compatibility, but also time, commitment, and effort.  There are a lot of things we can do if things aren’t going well. One approach is to invest more. I'm finding myself disappointed and frustrated, can I make the marriage meet the expectations that I'm bringing to it? Well, yes. There's a chapter in the book that talks concretely about ways that we can do that. The science is now at a point where we can say that it’s not just about going on more dates; we can be specific about what sorts of dates are useful for what sorts of goals.  For example, if one of the things you really want to do is try to get back some passion in the marriage, then it's not just any date that will do that. It's dates that get you out of your routine. So, novel and exciting sorts of dates rather than just any date.  Sean Illing  If you could give one bit of advice to a newlywed or someone thinking about getting married, what would it be?  Eli Finkel  I would say congratulations. You're lucky to be getting married in an era that has the best marriages we've ever seen. If you want to try to achieve one of those sorts of marriages, try not to do it on the cheap. Be attentive. The average marriage declines in happiness over time starting pretty soon after the wedding day. If you just look back and wait and see how it goes, it's likely to get worse. John F. Kennedy, when talking about the economy, said that ""The time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining.""  I would tell a newlywed who's just getting married: Don't wait until it's time to seek marital therapy. Be proactive about making the relationship a bit stronger.  Sean Illing  In other words, marriage is not something you have, it's something you do — so act accordingly.  Eli Finkel  Wow, I might steal that line from you. That’s a lovely way to say it. And it’s exactly right.",2.0,3.0
737,2151,10,18,2017,2017-10-18,Associated Press News,"Twitter vows new crackdown on hateful, abusive tweets"," This Friday, Oct. 18, 2013, file photo, shows a Twitter app on an iPhone screen in New York. Twitter vowed to crack down further on hate speech and sexual harassment on its platform, days after CEO Jack Dorsey said in a tweet-storm that the company was ""still"" not doing enough to protect its users. In an email shared with The Associated Press Tuesday, Oct. 17, 2017, Twitter's head of safety policy outlined the new guidelines to the company's Trust and Safety Council, a group of outside organizations that advises Twitter on its policies against abuse. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)  NEW YORK (AP) — Twitter is vowing to crack down further on hate speech and sexual harassment, days after CEO Jack Dorsey said in a tweetstorm that the company is not doing enough to protect its users.  The company has spent the last two years trying to clamp down on hate and abuse on its generally free-wheeling service.  Dorsey echoed concerns of many users and critics who say Twitter it hasn’t done enough to curb the abuse. But others worry that it’s muzzling free speech in the process.  In an email Twitter shared with The Associated Press Tuesday, the company’s head of safety policy outlined the proposed new guidelines that tighten existing rules and impose some new ones. They aim to close loopholes that allowed people to glorify violence, for example.  The email was sent to the company’s Trust and Safety Council, a group of outside organizations that advises Twitter on its policies against abuse.  “It’s good that Twitter is thinking these things through and being fairly transparent about what they are doing,” said Emma Llanso, director of the free expression project at the Center for Democracy and Technology, a nonprofit that’s a member of the Trust and Safety Council. But, she added, it will be very important to have a clear appeals process and ways to review whether the policies are effective.  Twitter sent it to the group for input, and the changes are not yet final. News of the changes was first reported by Wired .  WHAT’S CHANGING?  Some of the changes are aimed at protecting women who unknowingly or unwillingly had nude pictures of themselves distributed online or were subject to unwanted sexual advances. They would also try to shield groups subject to hateful imagery, symbols and threats of violence.  Among the proposed changes, Twitter said it would immediately and permanently suspend any account it identifies as being the original poster of “non-consensual nudity,” including so-called “creep shots” of a sexual nature taken surreptitiously. Previously, the company treated the original poster of the content the same as those who re-tweeted it, and it resulted only in a temporary suspension.  It said it would also develop a system allowing bystanders on Twitter to report unwanted exchanges of sexually charged content, whereas in the past it relied on one of the parties involved in the conversation to come forward before taking action. Twitter already allows bystanders to report other violations on behalf of someone else.  The San Francisco-based company also said it would take new action on hate symbols and imagery and “take enforcement action against organizations that use/have historically used violence as a means to advance their cause,” though it said more details were to come.  It didn’t say what the hate symbols might be and enforcing this could prove difficult. While some hate symbols, like the swastika, are widely recognized, groups have also adopted lesser-known, seemingly innocuous symbols to show hate. Those include “Pepe the Frog,” a cartoon frog that has become a symbol for the “alt-right” movement known for racist and misogynist views. The milk emoji has also been used by white supremacists as an online symbol.  Twitter already takes action against direct threats of violence, the company said it would also act against tweets that glorify or condone violence.  IS IT ENOUGH? TOO MUCH?  On Friday, Dorsey foreshadowed the coming policy changes in a series of tweets, saying the company’s efforts over the last two years were inadequate.  “Today we saw voices silencing themselves and voices speaking out because we’re (asterisk)still(asterisk) not doing enough,” Dorsey tweeted.  At the same time, Llanso said, Twitter also must tread carefully not to sweep up legitimate discourse along with hate speech and abuse. Unlike Facebook, Twitter permits anonymity. While this can be used as a tool for abuse and harassment, it also allows for people and groups to speak out when they otherwise couldn’t.  “Any kind of policy that is about taking down speech online, will be used for its intended purpose, but also by others who are looking to get things censored online,” she said. “People out there looking to silence voices they disagree with are very savvy.”  In the end, whether the policies work will have to be tested out in the field, by Twitter’s users.  “There will definitely be mistakes,” Llanso said.  RUSSIA SCRUTINY  The moves also come amid intense scrutiny from congressional investigators into how Russian agents used Twitter, Facebook and Google to influence last year’s U.S. election. Twitter has said it would appear at a public congressional hearing on Nov. 1 after already briefing a Senate committee.  The company has handed over the handles, or profile names, of 201 accounts it believes were linked to Russia. It has also said at least $274,000 in U.S. ads were bought by Russia Today, a Russian-government-linked media outlet, last year.  ___  AP Technology Writer Ryan Nakashima contributed to this story from Menlo Park, California.",50.0,82.0
1488,3156,11,8,2017,2017-11-08,Fox News,"John Stossel: 'Keep it simple, stupid' works with the new tax plan, too","As you read this, President Trump's tax plan is being debated. Congress will change it. Where this ends, no one knows.  I want two things:  1. Simplification.  2. More money in private hands.  Trump offers some of both.  His cuts would leave more money in private hands, where it will be used more efficiently. Politicians' spending decisions already put us $20 trillion in debt; they shouldn't be trusted with more money.  Cutting the corporate tax rate isn't popular (rich people!), but a cut is needed. Economic growth is really important. It's stifled when America's taxes are higher than other nations'.  Trump also offers some simplification. Good. The more complex the rules, the more time we waste hiring accountants and the more time lawyers spend fighting over who qualifies for what. Trump would double the personal exemption (fewer people will itemize) and kill the ""death tax,"" deductions for local taxes and the alternative minimum tax.  It's a start. But that's not nearly good enough. Heck, the ""simplification"" bill itself is 400 pages long.  Americans spend about 7 billion hours trying to comply with today's tax rules. That's the equivalent of 3.7 million people working 40-hour weeks. What a waste.  I spend hours filling out forms and forwarding paperwork to an accountant. I distort my spending and investments because of tax rules. What a waste.  America's first 1040 form was four pages long. Today's code is more than 3.7 million words. No one understands it.  Even the tax specialists get things wrong.  Yet parts of Trump's plan make taxes more complex: He increases the child tax credit and creates a new credit for nonchild dependents. It may be fair to help people who care for helpless adults, but each new deduction creates complexity and parasites who feed off it. As usual, some rich people will game that credit, and some poor people will never figure it out.  Far better to lower everyone's taxes to, say, 15 percent, by getting rid of all deductions.  Then we could focus on creating wealth instead of filling out forms.  But good luck with that, President Trump.  Today's tax deductions are the main reason we've got a huge culture of lobbyists.  One of the most unfair tax breaks is the mortgage interest deduction. It encourages rich people to buy more homes than we need. It exacerbates housing bubbles.  Trump merely proposed cutting the maximum deduction to half-a-million dollars. But even that has the swamp creatures screaming, ""Unfair!""  Jerry Howard of the National Association of Home Builders says he will fight that ""tooth and nail."" He claims it ""is a direct assault on the American dream of homeownership.""  Bunk. Canada has no mortgage deduction, yet Canada's homeownership rate is higher than the United States'. The big mortgage deduction is welfare for the rich.  But people like Howard have clout. Homebuilders and mortgage bankers give politicians money.  Likewise, even some Republicans in high-tax states like New York and New Jersey now are whining about losing state tax deductibility. They fear voter backlash in their districts.  Once again, Congress ends up fighting over who gets the biggest cuts instead of the overall tax haul and size of government.  Ideally, tax cuts should be accompanied by even larger spending cuts to avoid expanding that $20 trillion debt. But that's not happening.  How about a variation on Trump's two-for-one regulation rule (cut two regulations for each new one you propose)? Cut two dollars from the budget for every dollar in tax reduction. That way we won't end up deeper in the hole.  The best way to avoid Washington's spending getting out of balance is to avoid giving them our money in the first place.  I'm rooting for a tax law so simple that everyone understands it, and one that will keep as much money as possible out of government's hands.  That's the best formula for a growing economy.",6.0,4.0

China's campaign to stamp out use technology that allows web surfers to evade its internet filters is disrupting work and study for entrepreneurs, scientists and students. The crackdown comes as the ruling Communist Party tightens political control ahead of a congress at which President Xi Jinping is due to be appointed to a second 5-year term as leader. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan, File)  BEIJING (AP) — Frank Chen’s e-commerce business has nothing to do with politics but he worries it might be sunk by the Communist Party’s latest effort to control what the Chinese public sees online.  Chen’s 25-employee company sells clothes and appliances to Americans and Europeans through platforms including Facebook, one of thousands of websites blocked by China’s web filters. Chen reaches it using a virtual private network, but that window might be closing after Beijing launched a campaign in January to stamp out use of VPNs to evade its “Great Firewall.”  “Our entire business might be paralyzed,” said Chen by phone from the western city of Chengdu. Still, he added later in a text message, “national policy deserves a positive response and we fully support it.”  The crackdown threatens to disrupt work and study for millions of Chinese entrepreneurs, scientists and students who rely on websites they can see only with a VPN. The technology, developed to create secure, encrypted links between computers, allows Chinese web users to see a blocked site by hiding the address from government filters.  Astronomers and physicists use services such as Google Scholar and Dropbox, accessible only via VPN, to share research and stay in touch with foreign colleagues. Merchants use Facebook and other blocked social media to find customers. Students look for material in subjects from history to film editing on YouTube and other blocked sites.  Control over information is especially sensitive ahead of October’s twice-a-decade ruling party congress at which President Xi Jinping is due to be named to a second five-year term as leader.  The VPN crackdown is part of a campaign to tighten political control that activists say is the most severe since the 1989 suppression of the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement.  Dozens of activists and lawyers have been detained. A cybersecurity law that took effect in June tightens control on online data. Regulators have stepped up censorship of social media and video websites.  How many people might be affected is unclear, but consumer research firm GlobalWebIndex said a survey of Chinese web surfers this year found 14 percent use a VPN daily. If that percentage holds for China’s total online population of 731 million, it suggests the country might have as many as 100 million regular users.  Some 8.8 percent of people in the survey use VPNs to look at “restricted sites,” according to GlobalWebIndex. That would be equivalent to 65 million people, or the population of Britain.  Communist leaders encourage web use for business and education. They want online commerce to help transform China from a low-wage factory into a high-tech consumer society. But they reject the notion of a borderless internet and free flow of information.  Chinese web users without VPNs cannot see the most popular global websites including Google and social media such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, as well as news outlets and human rights groups.  In the latest crackdown, regulators say only government-authorized VPNs will be allowed. The operator of a popular service, Green VPN, told customers in June it had been ordered to close. Others shut down without warning.  “You have to leave a window for people, for those who need it,” said Wen Jian, a securities trader in Beijing.  Wen said he needs to find financial information and Google, accessible only with a VPN, is more effective than Chinese search engines. But his VPN quit working two months ago.  “As far as I know, some government people use VPNs too,” said Wen, 27. “They read things abroad. Why can they have it and we cannot?”  The crackdown reflects Xi’s notion of “internet sovereignty,” or Beijing’s absolute right to control what people can do and see online.  Unauthorized VPNs already were banned but authorities appeared to ignore them, possibly to avoid disrupting business or to defuse resistance among professionals and academics.  Government spokespeople refuse to acknowledge any site is blocked, though researchers say they can see attempts to reach sites such as Google stopped within servers operated by state-owned China Telecom Ltd., which controls China’s links to the global internet.  Regulators have yet to say who will be allowed to use government-licensed VPNs or what they can see. But a letter sent by China Telecom to some corporate customers this year offers a hint: It says VPNs can link only to a company’s headquarters abroad and no other sites. It warns violators will lose access.  Until now, web controls have acted like a tax, allowing users to see blocked sites by paying for a VPN, according to Margaret E. Roberts, a political scientist at the University of California at San Diego.  “As VPNs become more difficult to access, it’s like the government is raising the tax,” said Roberts in an email. “If VPNs were illegal, we would expect a different calculation for those seeking access.”  In a sign of a more severe official stance, a 26-year-old entrepreneur who sold VPN service in Dongguan, near Hong Kong, was sentenced in March to nine months in prison.  The agency in charge of the crackdown, the Cyberspace Administration of China, and the Cabinet press office didn’t respond to questions sent by fax and email about what, if anything, the public will be allowed to do with authorized VPNs.  Chen, the online merchant, said he heard private companies might be permitted but he has yet to apply.  The economic impact is unclear, but other Chinese data controls already are a drag on business.  The European Center for International Political Economy estimated in 2014 curbs in effect or planned could cut economic growth by up to 1.1 percentage points. That would be equal to as much as $130 billion of lost activity in China’s $12 trillion-a-year economy.  “I asked some friends, and if a large number of VPNs are banned, then everyone’s response is there will be a big impact on their business,” Chen said.  Chinese leaders faced similar complaints after the “Great Firewall” was activated in 2002. It blocked access to Google, prompting an outcry from scientists and businesspeople who needed to find research papers and commercial information.  Public complaints have been muted in part because Chinese companies have developed alternatives to popular global services.  Instead of Facebook and Twitter, Chinese social media users have WeChat and Sina Weibo. Baidu Inc. provides Google-style search that complies with official censorship.  “I am pretty lazy,” said Hao Kailin, a landscape designer in Beijing who finds images online for work. “If it is too much trouble to look for pictures from prohibited websites, then I give up.”  ___  Associated Press researcher Fu Ting contributed to this report.",2.0,2.0

The threat is dual, we are told: against the companies and the Washington establishment.”  “From the Trump base, Steve Bannon is railing against the ‘Lords of Silicon Valley,’ and advocating the regulation of the big tech companies as public utilities,” they continued. “The appeal resonates with rank-and-file Republicans, who broadly believe that Facebook and Google ‘have it out for them,’ a Bannon ally tells Axios. ‘They feel Facebook is weaponized against conservatives.'”  The unnamed “ally” of Bannon added, “It will be a political issue on the right whether it’s two, four or six years from now.”  “Steve looks at Silicon Valley and says, ‘Today, corporate power is centered there,'” they claimed. “He is saying that these are the guys running our lives, keeping our data, our content, and our communications… Silicon Valley is the new Wall Street.”  On Monday, it was reported that Google, Facebook, and Twitter have been spending millions of dollars lobbying Congress following an increased threat of regulation.  According to CNBC, “Google spent $4.17 million lobbying Congress this most recent quarter,” while, “Facebook spent $2.85 million,” and “Twitter spent $120,000.”  This week, the CEO of a popular advertising company called Google a “dictator” in the ad market, while a Vice News report announced Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s plans to “influence American politics for generations to come.”  PragerU also announced their lawsuit against YouTube and its parent company Google this week over alleged censorship of conservatives on the platform.

The Winston Box is a monthly subscription box that designs and makes its own clothes for big guys. More online retailers are chasing after plus-sized men, selling big sizes of slim-cut jeans, faux leather jackets and other trendy clothing that can be hard to find at the local big and tall store. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)  NEW YORK (AP) — Chris Cyr doesn’t like much about the big and tall clothes he finds in stores: They’re “not very adventurous,” he says, and the fit can be too baggy. And then there’s the array of odd prints: “A lot of Hawaiian shirts with sailboats and golf balls tend to pop in.”  But the standup comic from St. Louis says he is finding more fashionable threads for bigger guys online, as a crop of internet retailers are finally catering to the long-ignored group. The companies are making larger sizes of slim-cut jeans, bomber jackets and other trendy clothes that shoppers say are hard to find elsewhere.  Bigger-sized models are used when designing the clothes, which the companies say helps make sure the proportions are right. Rather than just making a pair of jeans larger, for example, they also adjust the back pockets and other details.  Asos, the hip online clothing seller, launched a line for plus-sized men late last year. MVP Collections, founded a year ago, sells velour hoodies in sizes up to 6XL and motorcycle jeans that go up to a size 54. And The Winston Box, which calls itself a clothing subscription service “for guys with some junk in the trunk,” sends up to four items a month to members.  Big guys want to look stylish, too. Although they've always had big and tall shops to turn to, many shoppers say they don’t find the trendy clothes they crave there. Now, a crop of online retailers are finally catering to the long-ignored group. (Oct. 4)  “There’s a lot more options,” says Cyr. He pays $75 a month for The Winston Box, and says the 3XL shirts he receives fit better than what he finds elsewhere. He also recently bought a blazer from Asos that he wears to his standup shows.  Men have long had big-and-tall shops to turn to, but young shoppers say they don’t find the trendy clothes they crave there. Kyle Gammon, a college fashion student who lives near Savannah, Georgia, says Asos has become his go-to after he discovered its plus-size line earlier this year. While fit can sometimes be a question for anyone buying online, Gammon has bought a couple of print shirts from the site. He likes the way they fit, giving him just enough room around his midsection without a lot of extra fabric in the arms. He’s also a fan of the colors and styles the site offers.  “They have a really good variety,” says Gammon, “which I’m not used to getting.”  Former baseball player Mo Vaughn, who co-founded MVP Collections, says he could find T-shirts and suits in his size in stores, but nothing in between. Now his company sells items such as gray sport jackets and deconstructed jeans made with a bit of spandex for stretch.  “Why can’t we be fly like everybody else?” Vaughn says.  Daniel Franzese, an actor who starred in “Mean Girls,” joined The Winston Box as creative director earlier this year after seeing an ad for the company on Facebook. He says stylists often had trouble finding clothes for him to wear for TV roles or for red carpet events.  “Fashion forgets about the bigger male,” Franzese says.  That’s still generally true, even with the new options. Several market research firms said they didn’t track or have estimates of the value of the men’s big-and-tall clothing market. And startups say that to promote their brands, they go to conventions and events around the country aimed at curvy or plus-size women — because there aren’t any for big men.  Diana Smith, a retail and apparel analyst at research group Mintel, expects that to change. She says the high obesity rate, plus an increase in the number of men who care about how they dress, will increase the demand for big-sized men’s clothing. She says the success of women’s plus-size clothing, which according to NPD Group had sales of $20.6 billion in the last year, also helps.  “There’s a lot of buying power there,” says Smith.  At Asos, it was the positive feedback from its women’s plus-size line launched about eight years ago that pushed the company to create one for men, says head designer Nick Eley. Asos says about 15 percent of its men’s line is now available in bigger sizes, and it expects to increase that percentage. About 30 brands, such as Puma and Tommy Hilfiger, also make big and tall sizes for the site.  “I honestly don’t know why it’s been a forgotten market for so long,” says Eley.  _____  Associated Press video journalist Teresa Crawford in Chicago contributed to this report.  _____  Contact Joseph Pisani at http://twitter.com/josephpisani",16.0,22.0
1183,2780,10,29,2017,2017-10-29,Associated Press News,Why the explosive growth of e-commerce could mean more jobs,"Why the explosive growth of e-commerce could mean more jobs  In this Aug. 3, 2017, photo, workers prepare to move products at an Amazon fulfillment center in Baltimore. While jobs have been lost in brick-and-mortar stores, many more have been gained from e-commerce and warehousing. Amazon accounts for much of the additional employment. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)  WASHINGTON (AP) — When the robots came to online retailer Boxed, dread came, too: The familiar fear that the machines would take over, leaving a trail of unemployed humans in their wake.  “I had a lot of people asking me, ‘What is going to happen to us?’” says Veronica Mena, a trainer for the e-commerce startup, recalling the anxiety that rippled through her co-workers after company executives announced plans to open an automated warehouse in nearby Union, New Jersey.  Yet their fears didn’t come to pass.  When the new warehouse opened this spring, workers found that their jobs were less physically demanding than at the older, manual warehouse in Edison, New Jersey. Instead of walking thousands of steps a day loading items onto carts, employees could stand at stations as conveyor belts brought the goods to them.  And rather than cutting jobs, the company added a third shift to keep up with rapidly growing demand.  What happened at Boxed — and has occurred elsewhere — suggests that widespread fears about automation and job loss are often misplaced. Automation has actually helped create jobs in e-commerce, rather than eliminate them, and stands to create more in the years ahead. By accelerating delivery times, robotics and software have made online shopping an increasingly viable alternative to bricks-and-mortar stores, and sales have ballooned at online retailers.  The surge in e-commerce has required the rapid build-out of a vast network of warehouses and delivery systems that include both robots and human workers. The robots didn’t take jobs from people, because many of the jobs didn’t exist before.  “We’re not looking to do the same work with half the people,” said Rick Zumpano, vice president for distribution at Boxed. “Since we’re growing, we need everyone.”  Newer robotic technologies do loom as a threat to some e-commerce jobs. Startup robotics companies are developing robot arm prototypes, for example, that can pick goods from shelves. Those devices may replace some workers over the next decade.  But the explosion of e-commerce and the ease of automation are leading e-commerce companies to build more warehouses. So even if each warehouse employs fewer workers, the proliferation of new warehouses is projected to generate hiring across the industry.  In the meantime, jobs have been lost at storefront retailers, which have suffered under the e-commerce onslaught. Venerable chains such as Toys “R″ Us, RadioShack, and Payless Shoesource have all filed for bankruptcy this year.  There are widespread fears that things will get only worse for the nation’s 16 million retail workers. Self-checkout kiosks and experimental stores like Amazon’s Go , which has no cashiers, could theoretically eliminate millions of retail jobs.  But worries about a “retail apocalypse” have missed a more important trend: E-commerce actually leads to more jobs by paying people to do things we used to do ourselves.  When people shop online, tasks that once filled their days — driving to a store, searching through aisles for a product, bringing it to a cashier and paying for it — are now done by warehouse employees and truck drivers. People spend less time shopping than in the past, research shows.  Joe Song, an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch who has studied government data, has found that working women are spending less time shopping — nearly 25 hours less per year compared with a decade earlier. Song attributes the time savings mainly to e-commerce. Families increasingly outsource shopping to e-commerce employees, just as many have long outsourced other household tasks to child care workers or house cleaners. In each case, jobs are created.  That means the bankruptcies and store closings in the retail sector aren’t the complete picture. While jobs have been lost in stores, many more have been gained from online shopping. Michael Mandel, an economist at the Progressive Policy Institute, calculates that the number of e-commerce and warehousing jobs has leapt by 400,000 in the past decade, easily offsetting the loss of 140,000 brick-and-mortar retail jobs.  Amazon accounts for much of the additional employment. Yet it’s also at the vanguard of automation. Since 2014, Amazon has deployed 100,000 robots in 25 warehouses worldwide. At the same time, it’s nearly tripled its hourly workforce, from roughly 45,000 to nearly 125,000.  Its use of robotics has shaved the operating costs for a warehouse by about 20 percent, according to a report by Deutsche Bank. Such savings, in turn, have lowered the cost for Amazon to open new facilities — and hire more workers.  Mandel points out that it’s a lot like what happened more than a 100 years ago, when Henry Ford’s installation of assembly lines — an early form of automation — helped reduce the price of cars, which boosted demand so much that Ford needed more workers.  Robots have displaced many manufacturing workers in the past two to three decades, enabling factories to produce more with fewer employees.  Yet e-commerce and warehousing are growing far faster than manufacturing is — a crucial difference that lessens the impact of automation. E-commerce sales are surging roughly five times as fast as storefront retail sales, according to market research firm Forrester. By 2022, they’re expected to account for 17 percent of all retail sales, up from 13 percent this year.  From a handful of distribution centers in 2000, Amazon now has more than 240 warehouses and smaller delivery facilities, according to MWPVL, a consulting firm. Those warehouses have created tens of thousands of jobs and boosted wages in some communities, which many local employers call “the Amazon effect.”  But Amazon is not the only company that has experienced growth due to e-commerce.  Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, recently opened its sixth e-commerce campus near Orlando, Florida. Like the others, it includes a million square foot warehouse.  Walmart is also expanding its online grocery pickup service to 2,000 stores, double the 1,000 where it is now available. It allows Walmart’s customers to order groceries online, but requires more workers, not fewer. Ravi Jariwala, a spokesman, says Walmart has created a new job classification — “personal shopper” — to do what customers once did themselves: Pick and package orders.  And XPO Logistics, which ships mostly appliances and other heavy goods, has hired 3,000 warehouse workers in the past year to keep up with growing e-commerce, bringing its total to 26,000. It’s adding a million square feet of warehouse about every four to six weeks, says Ashfaque Chowdhury, president of XPO’s supply chain in the Americas and Asia.  Chowdhury says items that many people wouldn’t have felt comfortable buying on the internet not long ago — from refrigerators to treadmills to furniture — are becoming routine online purchases. And the company is also planning to open a million square foot warehouse in the Midwest exclusively to handle returns.  All these trends have been helped by automation’s ability to hold down costs, such as Walmart’s use of drones to help track its warehouse inventory.  Still, a tour of Boxed’s gleaming new warehouse in Union makes it easy to see why people worry that automation costs jobs. Everywhere you look you see machines and rows of neatly organized pallets of goods.  But not so many workers. Through the 140,000-square-foot building, two miles of conveyor belts quietly whisk plastic bins containing customers’ orders. One machine stamps mailing labels on boxes. Spread thinly along the conveyor belts, roughly three dozen workers operate on the floor.  Among the first stops on the conveyor is a four-story-high robotic contraption known as “Perfect Pick.” It enables one employee filling orders to choose from 700 items. An automated container, the iBOT, zips up and down and back and forth among the Perfect Pick’s shelves, where products are stored.  The iBOT retrieves small items — health and beauty products and snack foods — and brings them to the employee, who places them in bins.  At Amazon’s much larger warehouse in Baltimore, there are more workers, but also a lot more robots. They lift shelves of goods and roll them to the company’s pickers, who select items that customers have ordered before the robots return the shelves to storage.  Even so, there are still jobs at both warehouses for people to do. At Boxed, the bins glide from the Perfect Pick to other employees, who select additional items to complete an order. A separate group, the packers, puts everything in pastel-hued boxes for shipment. Fitting multiple items of different shapes and textures into a box is something people still do much better than robots.  Barbara Ward, 56, is a packer at Boxed, and like all her colleagues, she writes a thank-you note for each order she packages. It’s part of Boxed’s effort to preserve some aspects of the conventional shopping experience. When a customer has ordered diapers, a packer might write a congratulatory note.  At Amazon’s Baltimore warehouse, employees called “stowers” are needed to stock the shelves that are carried by robots. And that requires human judgment: Software suggests to workers where each item should be placed. But it’s an employee’s responsibility to make sure the shelves, which are tall and narrow, remain balanced.  There are also “problem solvers” who position themselves near a scale on a conveyor belt that weighs each package as it whizzes by. If the weight isn’t consistent with what’s supposed to be in the box, the package is set aside for a problem solver, who opens the box to see whether the order was filled correctly.  The warehouse covers the equivalent of 17 football fields and was opened in 2015, one of the first to be designed with robots in mind. Still, it employs 5,000 people.  Amazon and Boxed say their automated warehouses actually employ more workers than their non-automated warehouses do, because they handle far more volume.  And many employees say all the technology and machinery has made their jobs better.  Mena, 34, vastly prefers Boxed’s new facility to the manual warehouses where she previously worked. At one warehouse, owned by a medical equipment manufacturer, Mena says she would walk 15,000 steps a day to fill orders, according to her Fitbit. That’s about 7.5 miles.  “There’s less lifting to do,” she adds, now that goods are moved by conveyor belt rather than carts. “There are a lot of little things that make the job better.”  And with Boxed growing rapidly, she was promoted to trainer less than a year after starting as a temporary employee picking orders.  Ward, meanwhile, says she expects to be able to work longer at Boxed because her job is less physically demanding, thanks to automation.  Jobs are growing off the warehouse floor, as well. The explosion of online commerce is also building demand for higher-paying jobs in software and robotics. Nearly 14 percent of software job listings are now posted by retailers, according to data analyzed by Glassdoor, the job recruitment website. That share has doubled from 2012, says Andrew Chamberlain, Glassdoor’s chief economist.  And the software jobs are not as concentrated in places like Silicon Valley. Dallas, for example, has experienced a surge in software jobs, partly because of greater hiring by Home Depot.  “That’s a huge change,” Chamberlain said. “Software-related jobs are a bellwether of automation.”  Amazon’s career website lists nearly 5,000 open software jobs and 250 in machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence. Walmart is advertising 475 software and technology jobs, including data analysts, programmers, and software engineers.  These aren’t folks who just maintain websites.  When a customer shops on Boxed’s website, software calculates what size box will be needed and how much empty space it will contain, Zumpano said. Just before checkout, the website will recommend products that would fill the box’s empty space, yet not so many that the order would require another box.  Automation and robotics will only get more sophisticated in the future, which will threaten some jobs.  Amazon runs an annual “picking” contest in which mostly startup firms and universities compete to see which team’s robot can most efficiently pick items from a shelf and place them in a box.  “What’s going to happen next is robotic arms, combined with vision technology and suction technology,” says Marc Wulfraat, president of MWVPL, a consulting firm. “You can be darn sure that Amazon will take the first swing at it.”  But it could take several years for such robots to be put into widespread use. For now, they work mostly with items in boxes and other rigid shapes, Wulfraat says. They can’t yet handle bulkier items such as basketballs or softer items like clothes.  “Robotic hand technology is still pretty far off,” Boxed’s CEO, Chieh Huang, says. The company recently installed robots in its three other manual warehouses to transport goods to workers, as an alternative to conveyor belts. They didn’t lay off any employees.  And Mandel argues that if additional automation, such as robotic pickers, lowers costs further, it could create new markets for products and services, such as custom-made goods.  Wulfraat predicts that hundreds of smaller warehouses will be built in large cities to shorten delivery times to as low as an hour, particularly for groceries. Amazon already has 53 such facilities, and its competitors will be forced to follow suit.  “You’re going to need distribution facilities in the backyard of every city,” Wulfraat says. Those facilities will be smaller and cheaper and won’t be worth fully automating.  Automation is also more likely in the coming years to make up for labor shortages rather than replace workers, Wulfraat says.

868,2341,10,21,2017,2017-10-21,Fox News,"Perez tries to unify Democrats, says Trump an 'existential threat' to US","Democratic Party chairman Tom Perez tried to unify the political left around an anti-Trump message Saturday, calling the president an ""existential threat"" to the nation and ""the most dangerous president in American history.""  Addressing the first national party gathering since his election in February, Perez lambasted ""a culture of corruption"" that he said extends to Trump's Cabinet, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.  But Perez also warned that internal ruckuses over party priorities and leadership would distract from the goal of winning more elections to upend Republicans' domination in Washington.  The chairman's plea comes amid a rift over his appointments to little-known but influential party committees and the 75 at-large members of the national party committee. Perez and his aides plug his choices as a way to make the DNC younger and more diverse, but the moves also mean demotions for several prominent Democrats who backed Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential primaries and then supported Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison over Perez in the postelection race for party chairman.  Perez spent considerable time during the week's proceedings meeting privately with some frustrated DNC members, including some he did not reappoint. He apologized publicly Saturday for not reaching all of those members before he announced his appointments, but he defended his overall aim.  ""If someone ever asks you which wing of the party you belong to, tell 'em you belong to the accomplishment wing of the Democratic Party,"" he said, ""because you're trying to get s--- done. That's what we're trying to do here, folks. We're trying to move the ball forward.""  Republicans, meanwhile, have exalted in the internal wrangle, painting the DNC as incompetently discordant.  ""The Democratic Party's message of doom and gloom has left them leaderless and nearly extinct in most of the country,"" Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Ahrens said. ""If Tom Perez wants his party to stick with that same failed strategy, Republicans will gladly keep working to help the middle class by cutting their taxes and fixing our broken health care system.""  To some extent, the Democrats' developments reflect routine party politics after an unusually contentious chairman's race, but they also fit into the ongoing philosophical tussle on the left.  Sanders' backers accused the DNC in 2016 of stacking the nominating process in Clinton's favor and shutting out the Vermont independent who still seeks to pull the party toward his ideology. Those frustrations carried over into the DNC chair race between Perez, the former labor secretary, and Ellison.  Now, Perez's appointees will hold sway over setting the primary calendar in 2020 and, perhaps most importantly, whether the party's superdelegates, including the 75 at-large members, will continue to cast presidential nominating votes at Democratic conventions without being bound to any state primary or caucus results.  Democrats are looking next month to hold the Virginia governor's seat and wrest the New Jersey governor's seat from Republican control. Next year, Democrats need to flip at least 24 Republican congressional seats to regain control of the House. They face an uphill battle in gaining control of the Senate, because they must defend 10 incumbents in states Trump won last November. Democrats also want to increase their gubernatorial roster from the current 15 state executives.  Separately, former Attorney General Eric Holder urged the party to play the long game necessary to overcome Republican advantages scored when GOP-run legislatures drew congressional and legislative districts around the country after the 2010 census.  Holder leads a political action group, with fundraising support for former President Barack Obama, to back candidates in states where Democrats have an uphill path to majorities. He singled out Virginia, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia and Texas, among other states, where Republicans ""picked their voters"" with districts that ""are impressive in their geographic creativity but they are destructive to representative democracy.""  The Supreme Court earlier this month heard oral arguments in a case challenging the Wisconsin districts. Legal analysts expect Justice Anthony Kennedy, often the court's swing vote, will decide whether the court for the first time declares partisan gerrymandering unconstitutional.

A new essay in The New York Times takes the argument a step further, suggesting that despite the benefits companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon provide consumers, the cons are starting to outweigh the pros.  In an essay entitled ""Silicon Valley Is Not Your Friend,"" writer Noam Cohen outlines the way three of Silicon Valley's biggest companies – Facebook, Google and Amazon – have changed society. And despite their claims that they have users' best interests in mind, Cohen says it isn't always the case.  Writing ""the sins of Silicon Valley-led disruption have become impossible to ignore,"" Cohen goes into detail about the recent scandal surrounding Facebook and the role it played in Russian operatives interfering in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. Google, via its AdSense unit as well as YouTube, also played a role, with Russian operatives buying ads on its network, as they did on Twitter, which specifically called out state-backed media organization Russia Today.  FACEBOOK, GOOGLE, TWITTER: HOW TECH GIANTS ARE INVOLVED IN THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION  In recent days, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has asked for forgiveness for ways his ""work was used to divide people"" and has spoken about openly regretting his words that Facebook did not play a role in the 2016 U.S. election.  Zuckerberg recently said that Facebook would release the advertisements in question to Congress. But the 33-year-old CEO may have lost any good will he was beginning to earn when he was criticized for his tone-deaf response to showing off Facebook technology in light of the aftermath Hurricane Maria caused to Puerto Rico, leaving more than three-quarters of the country without power.  There is also the matter that Google and its chairman, Eric Schmidt, reportedly influenced think tank, New America – which describes itself as ""renewing American politics, prosperity, and purpose in the Digital Age"" – to cut ties with Barry Lynn after he was critical of Google and expressed support for the recent $2.7 billion antitrust penalty levied by a European Union court against the company.  (In a statement obtained by Wired, New America co-chair Jonathan Soros wrote in a letter to staff and its fellows that “Neither Google nor Eric Schmidt attempted to interfere,"" nor did “[t]hey did not threaten funding, and they did not call for any changes.”)  TRUMP ATTACKS AMAZON ON TWITTER AGAIN, SAYS IT'S 'DOING GREAT DAMAGE' TO RETAILERS  Amazon, which recently purchased Whole Foods in an attempt to gain market share in the $800 billion U.S. grocery market, has also come under heavy scrutiny as of late.  President Trump has repeatedly called out the Jeff Bezos-led company for a number of different reasons, including not paying so-called ""internet taxes"" and ""doing great damage to tax paying retailers.""  Cohen suggests that with the $13.7 billion Whole Foods acquisition, which the Trump administration allowed, it is pursuing ""the breathtakingly lucrative strategy of parlaying a monopoly position online into an offline one, too.""  Many have raised the question whether the U.S. government and its counterparts around the world have the regulatory power or know-how to keep them in check and not abuse their power.  ""Now that Google, Facebook, Amazon have become world dominators, the questions of the hour are, can the public be convinced to see Silicon Valley as the wrecking ball that it is?,"" Cohen wrote, adding on to those worries. ""And do we still have the regulatory tools and social cohesion to restrain the monopolists before they smash the foundations of our society?""",5.0,5.0

But while Trump once again threw Washington into a tizzy with tweets and offhand remarks, the policymaking train continued to chug forward with significant developments on taxes, health care, and trade.  Here’s what you need to know.  We got a bipartisan insurance stabilization deal  Sens. Patty Murray (D-WA) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) announced agreement on legislation that would help stabilize individual health insurance markets that have been reeling under the weight of several executive branch action designed to dismantle a framework created by the Obama administration.  CSR payments: The centerpiece of the deal is restoring funding for cost-sharing reduction payments to insurance companies. These CSR payments allow insurers to charge lower premiums, which ultimately results in more enrollment and lower federal spending on premium subsidies.

Flexibility: In exchange, the deal would also allow insurance companies to sell more low-cost, catastrophic-style insurance plans on the exchanges and make it easier for states to apply for waivers.  Republican leaders don’t seem to want a deal  After an initially supportive statement calling the Alexander-Murray legislation “a very good solution,” Trump seemed to turn tail and characterize the bill as a “bailout” for insurance companies.  Paul Ryan is opposed: House Speaker Paul Ryan also voiced opposition to the bill, and said “the Senate should keep its focus on repeal and replace of Obamacare” rather than on bipartisan deals.  House Speaker Paul Ryan also voiced opposition to the bill, and said “the Senate should keep its focus on repeal and replace of Obamacare” rather than on bipartisan deals. Having the votes v ersus getting a vote: With 12 Republican co-sponsors in the Senate so far, there’s a good chance Murray-Alexander would have the votes to pass Congress — but it would need to get a vote on the floor to pass, which can’t happen with leadership opposed.

The real deal may come later: The continuing resolution that funds the government expires in December, and it will take a bipartisan vote to extend or modify it. That, in theory, could be a time for bipartisan health legislation to end up folded into what’s going to be a big bipartisan package anyway.  The administration tested some new tax arguments  Republican tax reform legislation still lacks crucial details such as how many tax brackets there will be, what income thresholds the brackets will be pegged to, which deductions will be closed, and what will happen to the child tax credit, but while leaving such matters unresolved, the Trump administration did try out some new arguments.  Corporate tax cuts boost wages: On Monday, Kevin Hassett, head of the president’s Council of Economic Advisers, rolled out a paper purporting to show that middle-class wages would rise by $4,000 to $9,000 per year if the corporate tax rate is cut from 35 percent to 20 percent.

Math forces tax cuts for the rich: Meanwhile on Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin backed off earlier pledges to avoid cutting taxes for the rich by saying that “when you’re cutting taxes across the board, it’s very hard not to give tax cuts to the wealthy with tax cuts to the middle class.”  Meanwhile on Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin backed off earlier pledges to avoid cutting taxes for the rich by saying that “when you’re cutting taxes across the board, it’s very hard not to give tax cuts to the wealthy with tax cuts to the middle class.” What’s next? The critical question around taxes at this point is really congressional procedure and not the sales pitch. Will Senate Republicans do a temporary deficit-financed tax cut, or aim for a permanent one that’s paid for? Or will they change the Senate’s rules to allow for a permanent deficit-financed tax cut? Until a decision is made on that, everything else is essentially theoretical.  Nobody knows what’s happening with NAFTA  The ongoing process of renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement — a key campaign pledge that Trump hasn’t talked about much since Inauguration Day — has been an under-the-radar story in the United States but a much bigger deal in Mexico and Canada.

870,2343,10,21,2017,2017-10-21,Vox,Bannon: Bush “didn’t understand anything he was talking about” in his anti-Trump speech,"Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon eviscerated George W. Bush at the California Republican Party convention on Friday in a fiery speech that underscored his agenda to remold the GOP’s worldview.  Before a crowd packed with hundreds of Republican delegates, Bannon — perhaps the nation’s most influential advocate for Donald Trump’s America First worldview outside the White House — argued that Bush’s speech on Thursday criticizing Trump without naming him was a farce.  ""President Bush, to me, embarrassed himself,"" Bannon said. “The speechwriter wrote a highfalutin speech; it’s clear [Bush] didn’t understand anything he was talking about.”  “He has no earthly idea whether he’s coming or going, just like it was when he was president of the United States,"" Bannon added.  His remarks received enthusiastic applause from the crowd, as did another much more serious charge: “There has not been a more destructive presidency than George Bush’s.""  After making that claim, Bannon cited Bush’s (and Bill Clinton’s) failure to properly reckon with the threat posed by “the rise of China” during his presidency. And as a staunch critic of nation building in foreign policy, Bannon was likely also alluding to Bush’s invasion and occupation of Iraq.  Bannon versus Bush is a fight for the soul of the GOP  On Thursday, Bush delivered a speech in New York denouncing the rise of nationalism and decay in American political culture that was unambiguously targeted at Trump, even though he never mentioned Trump’s name.  “Bigotry seems emboldened. Our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication,” Bush said (in a line rich with irony in light of Bush’s dishonest push for the Iraq War and his 9/11-related ethnic profiling programs).  Bush also warned against campaigns to “wish globalization away.”  But on Friday, Bannon, who was ousted from the White House in August, defended the idea of economic nationalism — the idea that the domestic economy will be stronger if it’s protected by trade barriers like border taxes — as a key concept for Republicans to embrace.  Bannon also took a swipe at Sen. John McCain as “just another senator from Arizona” and heaped scorn on the “lords of technology” who rule Silicon Valley.  The timing and location of Bannon’s speech is essential to understanding what’s at play here. Bannon was speaking before the GOP in California — a state where they’re a minority party and face long odds in local and statewide office, as well as in their ability to deliver Electoral College votes to the Republican candidate for the presidency. And he was arguing that in order to succeed, they need to buck the establishment and embrace the rebellion that he and Trump began in 2016.  “We have a problem with understanding how to win. Nothing else matters,” Bannon said.  He reportedly received a standing ovation when he finished his speech.  Bannon has no problem bluntly communicating that his agenda is at odds with the GOP establishment. He’s previously called for an “open revolt” against Republicans who don’t line up with Trump’s vision, and plans to back primary challengers against nearly every Republican senator up for reelection in 2018. He also provided a boost to Roy Moore, the anti-establishment firebrand who defied expectations in September by securing the Republican nomination to replace the Senate seat in Alabama vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.  A source told Vanity Fair recently that Bannon believes Trump has a 30 percent chance of completing a full term in office. It’s unclear what fate he thinks will befall Trump, but he likely views the president as vulnerable to scandal.  Bannon’s mission is to make sure that even if Trump leaves office quickly, the America First worldview doesn’t.",17.0,13.0

Email *  Email      According to ABC 7:  Authorities say he came to the United States seven years ago from Uzbekistan under what is called the Diversity Visa Program, which offers a lottery for people from countries with few immigrants in America.  DIVERSITY LOTTERY  On May 1, 2017, the Washington Post wrote an article designed to criticize President Trump, as millions were concerned that this could be the last year of the “Diversity Lottery”.  According to the Washington Post, the lottery’s premise is simple. Each year, the Diversity Visa Lottery, as it is officially known, provides up to 50,000 randomly selected foreigners — fewer than 1 percent of those who enter the drawing — with permanent residency in the United States.It’s not connected to employment or family members in the United States. The only requirement is that entrants be adults with a high school diploma or two years of work experience. Winners can bring spouses and children. Citizens of countries that have sent 50,000 people to the United States in the past five years — such as Canada, China, India, Nigeria and Mexico — are ineligible to participate.  The current lottery coincides with an intense debate over immigration and comes amid policy changes that have made the country less welcoming to new arrivals. President Trump has cracked down on illegal immigration and pressed forward with plans to build a wall along the border with Mexico. He has issued executive orders targeting foreign workers, refugees and travelers from certain majority-Muslim countries.  But he hasn’t said a word about the green-card lottery.  Its days may be numbered, nonetheless. The lottery appears to conflict with the president’s call for a “merit-based” immigration system. And at least two bills in the Republican-controlled Congress seek to eliminate the program.  “The Diversity Lottery is plagued with fraud, advances no economic or humanitarian interest, and does not even deliver the diversity of its namesake,” according to a news release from Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), a co-sponsor of one of the bills.  The program — operated from a consular center in Williamsburg, Ky. — has been on the chopping block before. It came under attack in 2002 after an Egyptian terrorist who killed two people in Los Angeles was found to be in the United States through his wife’s diversity visa. Mohamed Atta, another Egyptian and one of the 9/11 suicide pilots, had entered the lottery twice before entering the United States on a different visa to study aviation.  “If you’re a terrorist organization and you can get a few hundred people to apply to this from several countries . . . odds are you’d get one or two of them picked,” Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) told The Washington Post in 2011 after introducing an ill-fated bill to kill the program.  State Department officials insist that lottery winners are vetted just as thoroughly as other potential immigrants to the United States.

(Warren Commission via AP)  WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump blocked the release of hundreds of records on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, bending to CIA and FBI appeals, while the National Archives came out Thursday night with a hefty cache of others.  “I have no choice,” Trump said in a memo, citing “potentially irreversible harm” to national security if he were to allow all records to come out now. He placed those files under a six-month review while letting 2,800 others come out, racing a deadline to honor a law mandating their release.  The documents approved for release capture the frantic days after the Nov. 22, 1963, assassination, during which federal agents madly chased after tips, however thin, juggled rumors and sifted through leads worldwide.  They include cables, notes and reports stamped “Secret” that reveal the suspicions of the era — around Cubans and Communists. They cast a wide net over varied activities of the Kennedy administration, such as its covert efforts to upend Fidel Castro’s government in Cuba.  For historians, it’s a chance to answer lingering questions, put some unfounded conspiracy theories to rest, perhaps give life to other theories.  Prof. Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia said it was ""ridiculous"" that so much time has passed since the assassination of President John F. Kennedy without the public release of documents. (Oct. 24)  Despite having months to prepare for disclosures that have been set on the calendar for 25 years, Trump’s decision came down to a last-minute debate with intelligence agencies — a tussle the president then prolonged by calling for still more review.  The delay sparked a round of finger-pointing among agencies and complaints that Trump should have released all records.  Roger Stone, a sometime Trump adviser who wrote a book about his theories on the assassination, urged Trump to review personally any material that government agencies still want to withhold. Trump should at least “spot check” any extensive redactions to make sure agencies are not “dabbling in acts of criminal insubordination,” Stone said in a statement.  As for the unreleased documents, Trump will impress upon federal agencies that “only in the rarest cases” should JFK files stay secret after the six-month review, officials said.  In the meantime, experts will be poring through a mountain of minutiae and countless loose threads in search of significant revelations.  In the chaotic aftermath of the assassination, followed two days later by the murder of the shooter, Lee Harvey Oswald while in police custody, FBI Director J, Edgar Hoover vented his frustration in a formerly secret report found in the files. It opened: “There is nothing further on the Oswald case except that he is dead.”  But, reflecting on Oswald less than an hour after he died, Hoover already sensed theories would form about a conspiracy broader than the lone assassin.  “The thing I am concerned about, and so is (deputy attorney general) Mr. Katzenbach, is having something issued so we can convince the public that Oswald is the real assassin,” he said.  He also reported: “Last night we received a call from our Dallas office from a man talking in a calm voice and saying he was a member of a committee organized to kill Oswald.”  Hoover said he relayed that warning to Dallas police and was assured Oswald would be sufficiently protected. Oswald was shot dead the next day by Jack Ruby.  The following message will be displayed to users with unsupported browsers: Your browser does not support the iframe HTML tag.

A document from 1975 contains a partial deposition by Richard Helms, a deputy CIA director under Kennedy who later became CIA chief, to the Rockefeller Commission, which was studying unauthorized CIA activities in domestic affairs. Commission lawyers appeared to be probing for information on what foreign leaders might have been the subject of assassination attempts by or on behalf of the CIA.  A lawyer asks Helms: “Is there any information involved with the assassination of President Kennedy which in any way shows that Lee Harvey Oswald was in some way a CIA agent or agent” — here the document ends, short of his answer.  Among the files is a more than 400-page document that appeared to describe people being monitored as potential threats to Kennedy and his successor, Lyndon B. Johnson.  Officials described one such person this way: “Subject participated in pickets against JFK in 1961. Allegedly trained in guerrilla tactics & sabotage. Considered very dangerous by those who know him. Has visited USA & Cuba. Considered armed and dangerous.”  Some suspicions missed the mark badly.  One document describes a person who sent a letter to Johnson in December 1963 stating “you’re doomed.” The document says: “Interviewed 1/23/64; friendly. Said letter was a joke. Not dangerous. Attending 5th grade.”  The collection also discloses a Sept. 14, 1962, meeting of a group of Kennedy’s senior aides, including brother Robert, the attorney general, as they discussed a range of options against Castro’s communist government.  The meeting was told the CIA would look into the possibility of sabotaging airplane parts that were to be shipped to Cuba from Canada. McGeorge Bundy, JFK’s national security adviser, cautioned that sensitive ideas like sabotage would have to be considered in more detail on a case-by-case basis.  Much of Thursday passed with nothing from the White House or National Archives except silence, leaving unclear how the government would comply with a law requiring the records to come out by the end of the day — unless Trump was persuaded by intelligence agencies to hold some back.  White House officials said the FBI and CIA made the most requests within the government to withhold some information.  Trump ordered agencies that have proposed withholding material related to the assassination to report to the archivist by next March 12 on which specific information meets the standard for continued secrecy.  That standard includes details that could cause “harm to the military defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement or conduct of foreign relations,” Trump wrote in his order. The archivist will have two weeks to tell Trump whether those recommendations validate keeping the withheld information a secret after April 26.  The full record will still be kept from the public for at least six months — and longer if agencies make a persuasive enough case for continued secrecy.  The collection includes more than 3,100 records — comprising hundreds of thousands of pages — that have never been seen by the public. About 30,000 documents were released previously — with redactions.  Whatever details are released, they’re not expected to give a definitive answer to a question that still lingers for some: Whether anyone other than Oswald was involved in the assassination.  The Warren Commission in 1964 concluded that Oswald had been the lone gunman, and another congressional probe in 1979 found no evidence to support the theory that the CIA had been involved. But other interpretations, some more creative than others, have persisted.  ___  Associated Press writers Alanna Durkin Richer in Boston and Laurie Kellman in Washington contributed to this report.",3.0,7.0

The New York version of FERGUSON is directed by Jerry Dixon.  Trending: AMERICA’S BIGGEST LOSER Explains Why Multiple Sexual Assault Claims Against Bill Clinton Are Not As Serious As Kavanaugh’s…Calls For CIVIL WAR! [VIDEO]  Much like the contentious real-life drama that played out on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, when Michael Brown was shot dead by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, filmmaker Phelim McAleer’s controversial retelling of what really happened that fateful day in the Ferguson the play, using only the Grand Jury testimony from the Officer Wilson trial, is sure to ruffle some feathers.    Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court? Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?  Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court? * Yes, he will be confirmed. No, he will not be confirmed.  Email *  Email      Black Lives Matter has been perpetuating a lie about Michael Brown and how he was a victim of murder at the hands of a white police officer, who had no grounds whatsoever to shoot him.  FERGUSON is a Verbatim Play – it only uses actual Grand Jury testimony from eyewitnesses who saw police officer Daren Wilson shoot Michael Brown. Most of these eyewitnesses are minorities and yet their accounts are totally at odds with the stories spun by the mainstream media and activists. This is why it is so important to bring the truth to New York. Obviously the New York theatrical establishment won’t support this play. They seem to really detest anything that challenges their cozy consensus world view.  Ferguson the play, was the brainchild of journalist and filmmaker Phelim McAleer, who many know for his hard-hitting documentary Fracknation, that pulled the curtain back on a false narrative being pushed by liberal activists and politicians, and exposed the truth behind the lies Americans were being told about the dangers of fracking.  Two years ago, when rehearsal began in Los Angeles for FERGUSON, McAleer found himself having to deal with 9 actors who walked out when rehearsals began, after reading the script (that is based on the verbatim Grand Jury testimony of the witnesses during the officer Wilson trial).  What makes FERGUSON so compelling, is that not one word of the Grand Jury testimony is altered or changed. McAleer, who was determined to keep the show alive, explains how difficult it has been to get his play to the New York stage:  McAleer tells viewers in the promotional video below, that the truth about what really happened in Ferguson is not what the mainstream media’s been telling you.: “The truth was so shocking to so many people, that 9 of the cast walked out during rehearsals in Los Angeles. I was determined that the show would go on, even though the cast walked out. And the cast walked out because what they wanted to believe, didn’t match the truth that was in the Grand Jury documents. They were so convinced by the media, of one version of events, and the truth didn’t matter to them, and they couldn’t handle it. So that’s why it’s so important to bring this to New York.”  Phelim goes on to remind viewers of how Mike Pence was attacked by the cast and audience when he went to see Hamilton in New York.  Despite the 9 members of the cast who walked out on the play in Los Angeles and the anger the play incited in many supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement, FERGUSON was very well-received by critics after its debut in Los Angeles.  Watch:  Phelim McAleer is asking for help to fund his FERGUSON production. Please consider making a contribution to this very worthy cause by clicking HERE to donate.  FERGUSON “made for a riveting spectacle and comes as a reminder both of the adversarial dramatic power that is inherent in any courtroom testimony and how even the dry language of a legal transcript can come alive when placed in the hands of skilled actors. Add a standing-room-only audience and the high stakes of this country’s ongoing debate about race, police profiling and its use of lethal force, and you’ve got the ingredients for an incendiary evening of theater.” -LA WEEKLY  Hopefully, FERGUSON the play will cause Americans to understand what really happened in Ferguson through the eyes of the people who testified to what they actually saw that day and not through the lies of the mainstream media and the false narrative of Black Lives Matter leaders and activists.",24.0,19.0

MacArthur Foundation, Yuval Sharon, center, is photographed in San Pedro, Calif. Sharon, founder and artistic director of The Industry, a Los Angeles-based production company that produces operas in nontraditional spaces and formats was named Wednesday, Oct. 11, 2017, as one of 23 people to receive a ""genius grant"" from the Chicago-based MacArthur Foundation. (John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation via AP)  CHICAGO (AP) — A director who has taken opera from the concert hall to the streets of Los Angeles and an organizer who helped put a human face on the plight of young undocumented immigrants are among this year’s MacArthur fellows and recipients of the so-called genius grants.  The Chicago-based John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation on Wednesday announced the 24 fellows, who each receive $625,000 over five years to spend any way they choose. The recipients work in a variety of fields, from computer science to theater, immunology and photography.  The foundation has awarded the fellowships annually since 1981 to people who show “exceptional creativity in their work and the prospect for still more in the future.” Previous winners include “Hamilton” playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda and author-journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates.  There is no application process. Instead, an anonymous pool of nominators brings potential fellows to the foundation’s attention. Those selected learn they’ve been chosen shortly before the awards are announced.  For opera director and producer Yuval Sharon, the news that he had been selected was “an enormous shock and honor.” When the foundation called, he assumed they were seeking a referral for someone else who’d been nominated.  “I’m totally amazed,” said Sharon, 37, the founder and artistic director of The Industry, a Los Angeles-based production company that produces operas in nontraditional spaces and formats.  A 2015 production transported audience members and performers to various locations in Los Angeles via limousines, with singers and musicians performing along the way and at each stop.  His next work, an adaptation of the radio program “War of the Worlds” will utilize decommissioned World War II sirens to broadcast the performance occurring inside the theater onto the streets. The sounds of performers stationed outdoors — and likely the traffic and other street noise — will then be transmitted back into the concert hall.  Sharon said he comes across many people who don’t think opera is for them, but he hopes hearing about these kinds of “audacious experiments” will peak their interest.  Another fellow, Cristina Jiménez Moreta, is co-founder and executive director of United We Dream, a national network of groups led by immigrant youth.  Moreta, 33, and her parents came to the U.S. illegally from Ecuador when she was a child. At 19, she revealed her undocumented status publicly. It was a move that put her and her family at risk of deportation, but also placed her at the forefront of a movement to change the way immigrants are perceived.  She was instrumental in pressing for the 2012 adoption of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the now-endangered executive order that allowed thousands of undocumented young people to live without fear of deportation.  Moreta said the fellowship is recognition of the resilience shown by her parents and other immigrants who “had the courage to stand up and say ‘we are here, this is our home and we are fighting.’”  The first people she told were her parents, who were fearful when she started organizing but now join her in marches and to pass petitions.  “They’re very proud,” she said.  Also selected was Dawoud Bey, a photographer and educator from Chicago whose portraits often feature people from marginalized communities. For “The Birmingham Project,” he commemorated the 1963 bombing at a church in Birmingham, Alabama, that killed six children, with a series of portraits of Birmingham residents who were the age of each of the children killed and the age they would be if they had lived.  Others announced Wednesday were writer and cultural critic Viet Thanh Nguyen — whose novel, “The Sympathizer,” about a communist double agent, won the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for fiction — and Derek Peterson, a historian of East Africa and professor at the University of Michigan.  ___  Online: www.macfound.org  ___  This story has been updated to correct the spelling of the Chicago photographer’s name to Dawoud Bey, not Deyoud Bey.",1.0,1.0
1453,3100,11,7,2017,2017-11-07,Vox,Trump's next immigration target: people living legally in US after disaster struck their countries,"For nearly 20 years, since a 1998 hurricane, the US government has allowed tens of thousands of Honduran immigrants to stay and work in the US rather than forcing them to return to Honduras.  The Trump administration hasn’t ended that reprieve just yet. But it’s hinting, strongly, that it’s going to try.  On Monday, President Trump’s Department of Homeland Security announced that it was unable to come to a decision about whether to extend Temporary Protected Status (an immigration program that allows people from a certain country living in the US to remain and work here indefinitely while their home countries recover from disaster) for 57,000 Hondurans. DHS is terminating the protections for 2,500 Nicaraguans as of January 2019.  The Hondurans get six more months of protection (assuming they reregister with US Citizenship and Immigration Services) while the Trump administration makes up its mind. But a senior administration official warned Monday that “given the information available to” Acting Secretary Elaine Duke, “it is possible that the TPS designation for Honduras may be terminated with an appropriate delay at the end of the 6-month period.”  Indeed, the State Department recommended Friday that it push both Honduras and Nicaragua out of the program — along with El Salvador and Haiti.  The four countries together account for about 300,000 people living legally in the US — many of them for decades. The administration will make decisions about their fates over the next few months. And it’s expected to tell all of these people that they’re no longer welcome.  The Trump administration has already made it clear that it wants to send a message that TPS will not protect immigrants indefinitely, and that it wants beneficiaries to start thinking about leaving the United States.  But because so many have been in the US for so long — 63 percent of Hondurans have been in the US 20 years or more — the real likely outcome is that these TPS holders will stay in the US without legal authorization. By doing so, they’d join the 700,000 young unauthorized immigrants who are facing the expiration of their protections under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.  Over its first year in office, the Trump administration has made it clear that it wants to completely overhaul the basis on which the US grants legal status to immigrants. It envisions a “merit-based” immigration system in which individual immigrants are selected based on their high level of education and relevant professional skills — and the government has no obligation to let immigrants come to or stay in the US just because their homes and families are already here.  There are a lot of current US immigration policies that run afoul of the Trump administration’s ideas of merit, but TPS might be the biggest affront to their vision. Not only does it extend legal protections to people based almost entirely on what’s happened in their home countries, rather than what they can contribute as individuals, but it applies to people who were already living in the US when TPS was granted — instead of allowing the US to select immigrants in advance.  In context, the message the Trump administration is sending immigrants through sunsetting the TPS program is the same message it’s sending all other immigrants: Don’t get too comfortable.  For the past 27 years, Temporary Protected Status has been used as a form of humanitarian relief  The Temporary Protected Status program was created to mend a gap in President Ronald Reagan’s immigration policy.  When Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 into law, granting legal status to hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants, there was one group that was ineligible for protection: those who entered the country without authorization in 1982 or later. While the majority of people in this group were immediately subject to deportation, nationals of certain countries were granted “Extended Voluntary Departure” (EVD) status, an administrative reprieve that allowed the US attorney general to exclude certain foreign nationals from the list of those set to be deported immediately.  The EVD program was controversial: There was little criteria on what made a country eligible for it, and critics of the program charged that designations were based on politically motivated factors that failed to protect nationals of countries with volatile on-the-ground conditions. That belief was solidified when Reagan rejected the Salvadoran government’s request that EVD be extended to more than 400,000 Salvadoran refugees who had entered the US to escape a violent civil war, a decision Reagan justified by saying that Salvadorans were already unlikely to leave the country.  The TPS program, created through the Immigration Act of 1990, was supposed to resolve this issue by standardizing the process for shielding nationals of certain countries from deportation. Serving as a form of humanitarian relief, TPS is offered to nationals of countries struggling with the aftermath of war, natural disasters, or other humanitarian crises where conditions on the ground make it difficult for people to return to safely. Ten countries — El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Syria, and Yemen — are currently in the program, which is overseen by the Department of Homeland Security and is granted in six- to 18-month intervals that can be renewed as long as DHS deems a designation necessary.  To enter the program, nationals of a designated country must clear a number of conditions: They must maintain a relatively clean criminal record and pass a background check, they must pay a $495 processing fee when they first apply for the program and every time their status is renewed, and they must reside in the United States at the time of their country’s designation. This usually means that TPS beneficiaries are undocumented immigrants who were already in the US, those who overstayed a visa, or those who hold some other form of temporary immigration status.  TPS beneficiaries are granted authorization to work in the US (and in some cases the ability to travel internationally) and a reprieve from deportation. But outside of that, TPS doesn’t grant many other benefits; beneficiaries do not have legal permanent resident status, and while a small number of beneficiaries may be eligible for green cards through the sponsorship of a US citizen family member, the program is not intended to provide a path to citizenship. As Cecilia Menjívar, co-director of the Center for Migration Research at the at the University of Kansas, noted in a report on Central American TPS holders earlier this year, TPS beneficiaries are in a precarious position; while they are granted some of the benefits of residing in the US, their lack of full legal status prevents them from truly accessing everything.  TPS is the opposite of everything the Trump administration stands for on immigration — and it’s picking a fight over it  Unfortunately for the Hondurans and other TPS holders, the Trump administration no longer views humanitarian relief as a primary goal of the US immigration system.  It doesn’t help that most of the TPS holders are exactly the opposite of the immigrants that the Trump administration imagines a “merit-based” system would attract. The median household income for Hondurans with TPS, for example, was $40,000, and only 38 percent of them had high school diplomas, according to January estimates from the Center for Migration Studies.  In addition to their longtime status in the US, an estimated 53,000 US-born kids have at least one parent who benefits from Honduras’s TPS designation. The fact that these people have now largely settled here is one of the chief arguments for keeping TPS protections — indeed, that’s the logic that’s led the government to renew TPS for Honduras 10 times already.  But to the Trump administration, this is evidence that there’s something fundamentally wrong with the TPS program — because a program called “temporary” shouldn’t be leading people to settle permanently in the US. So the administration has made it abundantly clear that that’s going to change — and that it’s going to wind down TPS protections whenever possible.  It started with Haiti. In May, the administration announced that it would extend Haitian TPS protections for another six months — but no further.  “The Department of Homeland Security urges Haitian TPS recipients who do not have another immigration status,” per the DHS memo formally granting the extension, “to use the time before Jan. 22, 2018 to prepare for and arrange their departure from the United States — including proactively seeking travel documentation — or to apply for other immigration benefits for which they may be eligible.”  Haitians’ six-month TPS extension expires in January — giving the administration until November 23 to announce what will happen to the 50,000 Haitian TPS holders after that. But the shot across the bow in May raised concerns that Hondurans and Salvadorans, the other two groups that account for the overwhelming majority of TPS beneficiaries, might not even get the six-month wrap-up period, and that the government would strip 300,000 immigrants of protections over the first 10 weeks of 2018.  “The message,” then-Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said at a Miami press conference shortly after the Haiti announcement, “is: ‘TPS is temporary.’”  Other groups with TPS heard that message loud and clear — especially when the Trump administration announced in September that it was kicking about 1,000 Sudanese beneficiaries out of TPS as of November 2018. Immigrant rights organizations started mobilizing in support of TPS. The Congressional Black Caucus wrote a letter in support of TPS for Haiti; the Congressional Hispanic Caucus wrote letters in support of keeping TPS for Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador.  The government of Honduras lobbied the Trump administration over the summer to maintain TPS protections; the government of Haiti, which had already asked for a longer extension in May than it got, redoubled its efforts to keep TPS for its citizens from going away.  Even the Chamber of Commerce — which has been largely silent on immigration issues since the last failure of comprehensive immigration reform in Congress — wrote to the White House in support of TPS.  The mobilization seemed rapid, but it made sense. TPS beneficiaries have deep roots in the US. For the Trump administration, that’s a concern. For many other institutions in American society, from businesses to church groups, it’s an asset.  Revoking TPS visas doesn’t mean they’ll be deported, but they probably won’t leave on their own  The Trump administration doesn’t have the resources to deport 300,000 people the minute they lose their TPS protections. Arrests of immigrants are up, but deportations are down — and even the rise in arrests is dwarfed by the rise in the number of people the Trump administration considers deportable, compared to Obama-era policies.  Threats about an end to TPS are really an attempt to encourage “self-deportation” — to get TPS holders to stop expecting they’ll be allowed to stay in the US forever and start working on a plan to return home.  It’s a strategy that might make sense if TPS holders were determined to stay in the US as long as it was legal for them to do so but to leave the minute they lost legal protections. But neither of those appears to be the case.  When Hondurans first qualified for TPS in 1999, more than 100,000 of them were protected, according to an estimate from the Immigrant Legal Resource Center. That means that tens of thousands have left on their own (or adjusted to a more permanent legal status) even while they could have remained in TPS limbo indefinitely.  And as for the idea that the threat of losing TPS will inspire immigrants to leave, just look at Haitians — who’ve already been facing that prospect for months.  Some Haitians “prepared for and arranged” their travel — to Canada, where they’re seeking asylum. But others, clinging to the fact that the Trump administration hasn’t officially declared that TPS will end, are resistant to make plans to leave the country that many of them have lived in for most of their lives. “I have nothing to go back to,” Uber driver and would-be college student Jean Jubens Jeanty told the New York Times in July. “Why not keep me here?”  This isn’t optimism. It’s simply not having alternatives. “It’s very unsettling,” a Queens College senior told the Times, “to know that you’re here and you don’t know what tomorrow is going to bring, or what is going to happen in the next couple of months.”  Losing TPS wouldn’t create certainty — it would just open up a deeper anxiety, in which fear of being deportable is replaced with fear of actually getting deported.  By November 23, DHS will have to release its final decision on Haiti. In early March 2018, TPS for Salvadorans will run out unless it’s further extended, and thousands of DACA recipients per day will start losing protections. In May, the administration will have to come to a decision on Honduras.  All told, the Trump administration could ultimately be responsible for making over 900,000 more people vulnerable to deportation. It’s creating deportable immigrants much faster than it can actually deport them. And the gap between the possibility of deportation and its certainty creates lives full of fear.",4.0,6.0
574,1969,10,14,2017,2017-10-14,Fox News,Steve Bannon recruiting rabble-rousers to take on GOP establishment,"When Steve Bannon left the Trump administration in August, he said he could do more to shake up Washington from outside the White House than from inside.  Now, it looks as if Bannon's plan is coming together.  Bannon has been recruiting and promoting challengers to GOP incumbents and the party's preferred candidates in next year's midterm elections.  It's an insurgency that could give Washington the jolt it needs to end years of stagnation and gridlock -- and get the U.S. moving again.  But it could also imperil Republican majorities in the House and Senate.  The emerging Bannon class of rabble-rousers share limited ideological ties but have a common intent to upend Washington and knock out Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., standard-bearer of the establishment.  It's a crop of candidates that unnerves a GOP that lost seats -- and a shot at the Senate majority -- in 2010 and 2012 with political novices and controversial nominees and fears a stinging repeat in 2018.  ""The main thing that binds them together is a rejection of the Republican Party establishment, a rejection of the political elites, the financial elites and the media elites,"" said Andy Surabian, a former Bannon aide and senior adviser to the pro-Trump PAC Great America Alliance.  ""The main thing that binds them together is a rejection of the Republican Party establishment, a rejection of the political elites, the financial elites and the media elites."" — Andy Surabian, senior adviser to the Great America Alliance, a pro-Trump political action committee  Bannon helped elevate twice-suspended Judge Roy Moore, who won an Alabama runoff over McConnell's pick, Sen. Luther Strange.  Moore was removed from office for refusing to remove a Ten Commandments monument from Alabama's judicial building and then suspended for insisting probate judges refuse same-sex couples marriage licenses.  Moore faces Democrat Doug Jones in a December election where polls show a single-digit lead for the Republican, a remarkable development in Attorney General Jeff Sessions' heavily GOP state.  ""We don't have leadership. We have followership,"" Moore said Friday at the Values Voter Summit where he argued for scrapping the health care law with no replacement.  In West Virginia, the grassroots conservative group Tea Party Express endorsed Patrick Morrissey, also a Great America Alliance choice, over establishment favorite Rep. Evan Jenkins in a competitive race to unseat Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin.  Senate Republicans had been upbeat about adding to their 52-48 majority, especially with Democrats defending more seats in 2018, including 10 in states Trump won in last year's presidential election. But the Bannon challenge could cost them, leaving incumbents on the losing end in primaries or GOP candidates roughed up for the general election.  Consider Mississippi, where state Sen. Chris McDaniel lost to veteran Sen. Thad Cochran in 2014, but is weighing a bid next year against Roger Wicker, the state's other senator in the national legislature.  McDaniel misdefined ""mamacita,"" the Spanish word for mommy as ""hot mama,"" and said he would withhold his tax payments if the government paid reparations for slavery. He also was forced to denounce a supporter who photographed and posted an image of Cochran's bed-ridden wife.  He argued in court that his 2014 loss was due in part to African Americans fraudulently voting in the primary. He's back again and speaking in Bannon terms.  ""They will do anything, they will say anything, to just maintain a hold on power,"" McDaniel said in an Associated Press interview about McConnell and his allies.  He's already envisioning the theme of a challenge against Wicker.  ""On one side, a liberty-minded, constitutional conservative. On the other side, Wicker and McConnell,"" he said.  In Arizona, former state Sen. Kelli Ward, who is challenging Trump antagonist Sen. Jeff Flake, remains known for entertaining the debunked theory that jet aircraft are used to intentionally affect the weather or poison people.  In 2015, she gave conflicting answers about her beliefs after holding a public hearing she said was to answer constituents' questions. But John McCain used it to marginalize her in his winning GOP Senate primary against her, and McConnell reprised it in August in a web ad which referred to her as ""chemtrail Kelli.""  Former New York Rep. Michael Grimm, who spent eight months in prison for federal tax evasion, is challenging two-term Rep. Dan Donovan -- with the encouragement of Bannon.  In announcing his candidacy, Grimm was apologetic for his conviction. Still out there are viral videos of him famously telling a television reporter during an on-camera interview at the U.S. Capitol after a question he didn't like: ""You ever do that to me again, I'll throw you off this (expletive) balcony.""  House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., is sticking with the incumbent: ""I support Dan Donovan, plain and simple,"" Ryan said this week.  But he stopped short of suggesting Bannon stand down. ""It's a free country,"" he said.  In Nevada, Bannon is encouraging Republican Danny Tarkanian in his challenge to GOP Sen. Dean Heller. Tarkanian, son of famed basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian, is zero-for-five in state and federal elections.  These outsiders share strong opposition to increasing the nation's debt even if it means an economy-rattling default and unsparing criticism of congressional Republicans, especially McConnell, for failing to dismantle the Obama-era health care law, an unfulfilled seven-year-old promise.  In Wyoming, Erik Prince, founder of security contractor Blackwater, is considering a Republican primary challenge to Sen. John Barrasso, a senior member of the Senate GOP leadership team.

1475,3131,11,6,2017,2017-11-06,The New York Times,"If You Tear a Knee Ligament, Arthritis Is Likely to Follow in 10 Years","Doctors say they struggle with telling adolescents who just tore an A.C.L. that arthritis might follow. Owens says that he mentions arthritis but not in his initial conversations with young injured athletes.  “Most young athletes just want to focus on the problem at hand,” he said. “Yesterday in my office, I saw a 17-year-old soccer player. ‘Yes, you tore your A.C.L.’ The tears start to come. It is hard to talk to a 17-year-old about what their knee will be like in 20 years.”  Although Lalli, the former soccer player, said his arthritis diagnosis was a shock, he also said that knowing that it might happen would not have made much difference. He might have a genetic predisposition toward knee arthritis. His father took up soccer in his late 40s and had to have surgery at 50 when he tore the A.C.L. in his left knee.  Then he tore the meniscus — a piece of cartilage that acts as a cushion between the shinbone and the thighbone — in his right knee. He got arthritis later but thought it was because of his age, not his injuries.  Lalli’s arthritis progressed despite his receiving a second A.C.L. reconstruction that was more tailored to the anatomy of his knee. His initial operation had been done by a surgeon who did not position the new ligament in the exact place it had been before.  Lalli had the subsequent operation done by Dr. Freddie Fu, the chairman of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. Fu is a leader in A.C.L. operations that are more anatomically specific, and his procedure stabilized Lalli’s knee. Nonetheless, Lalli has faced years of disabling pain.  Four years ago, when his arthritis got so bad that he gave up playing soccer, Lalli asked for a knee replacement. Fu refused, telling him that artificial knees last only 10 or 15 years in younger and active people and that each knee replacement is more problematic than the one before.",3.0,2.0

Trump is allowing more employers to opt out of providing no-cost birth control to women by claiming religious or moral objections, issuing new rules Friday that take another step in rolling back the Obama health care law. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)  WASHINGTON (AP) — In a one-two punch elating religious conservatives, President Donald Trump’s administration is allowing more employers to opt out of no-cost birth control for workers and issuing sweeping religious-freedom directions that could override many anti-discrimination protections for LGBT people and others.  At a time when Trump finds himself embattled on many fronts, the two directives — issued almost simultaneously on Friday — demonstrated the president’s eagerness to retain the loyalty of social conservatives who make up a key part of his base. Leaders of that constituency were exultant.  “President Trump is demonstrating his commitment to undoing the anti-faith policies of the previous administration and restoring true religious freedom,” said Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council.  Liberal advocacy groups, including those supporting LGBT and reproductive rights, were outraged.  “The Trump administration is saying to employers, ‘If you want to discriminate, we have your back,’” said Fatima Goss Graves, president of National Women’s Law Center.  Her organization is among several that are planning to challenge the birth-control rollback in court. The American Civil Liberties Union filed such a lawsuit less than three hours after the rules were issued.  “The Trump administration is forcing women to pay for their boss’ religious beliefs,” said ACLU senior staff attorney Brigitte Amiri. “We’re filing this lawsuit because the federal government cannot authorize discrimination against women in the name of religion or otherwise.”  The Democratic attorneys general of California and Massachusetts filed similar suits later Friday.  Both directives had been in the works for months, with activists on both sides of a culture war on edge about the timing and the details.  The religious-liberty directive, issued by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, instructs federal agencies to do as much as possible to accommodate those who claim their religious freedoms are being violated. The guidance effectively lifts a burden from religious objectors to prove that their beliefs about marriage or other topics that affect various actions are sincerely held.  “Except in the narrowest circumstances, no one should be forced to choose between living out his or her faith and complying with the law,” Sessions wrote.  In what is likely to be one of the more contested aspects of the document, the Justice Department states that religious organizations can hire workers based on religious beliefs and an employee’s willingness “to adhere to a code of conduct.” Many conservative Christian schools and faith-based agencies require employees to adhere to moral codes that ban sex outside marriage and same-sex relationships, among other behavior.  The Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian law firm, called it “a great day for religious freedom.” But JoDee Winterhof of the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBT-rights group, depicted the two directives as “an all-out assault, on women, LGBT people and others” as the administration fulfilled a “wish list” of the religious right.  The new policy on contraception, issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, allows more categories of employers, including publicly traded companies, to opt out of providing no-cost birth control to women by claiming religious or moral objections — another step in rolling back President Barack Obama’s health care law that required most companies to cover birth control at no additional cost.  Employers with religious or moral qualms will also be able to cover some birth control methods, and not others. Experts said that could interfere with efforts to promote modern long-acting implantable contraceptives, such as IUDs, which are more expensive.  The top Democrat in the House of Representatives, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, said the birth-control rollback was despicable.  “This administration’s contempt for women reaches a new low with this appalling decision to enable employers and health plans to deny women basic coverage for contraception,” she said.  On the Republican side, however, House Speaker Paul Ryan welcomed the decision, calling it “a landmark day for religious liberty.”  The new policy took effect on Friday, but its impact won’t be known immediately and may not be dramatic.  “I can’t imagine that many employers are going to be willing to certify that they have a moral objection to standard birth control methods,” said Dan Mendelson, president of the consulting firm Avalere Health.  Nonetheless, he worried that the new rules would set a precedent for undermining basic health benefits required under federal law. The administration has estimated that some 200 employers who have already voiced objections to the Obama-era policy would qualify for the expanded opt-out, and that 120,000 women would be affected.  Since contraception became a covered preventive benefit, the share of female employees paying with their own money for birth control pills has plunged to 3 percent, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.  Many Catholic hospitals now rely on an Obama-era workaround under which the government pays for the cost of birth control coverage. That workaround can continue under the new rules.  Despite that workaround, there have been extensive legal battles waged by religious institutions and other parties challenging the birth-control mandate. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops hailed the new policy as a “return to common sense” that would enhance “peaceful coexistence” between church and state.  Doctors’ groups that were instrumental in derailing Republican plans to repeal Obama’s health law outright expressed their dismay.  The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said the new policy could reverse the recent progress in lowering the nation’s rate of unintended pregnancies.  “Instead of fulfilling its mission ‘to enhance and protect the health and well-being of all Americans,’ HHS leaders under the current administration are focused on turning back the clock on women’s health,” said the organization’s president, Dr. Haywood Brown.  ___  Crary reported from New York.

602,1998,10,13,2017,2017-10-13,Breitbart,BBC Video by Racist Trans Model Brands White People ‘Most Violent and Oppressive Force of Nature on Earth’,"The BBC has produced and aired a “take” by trans model Munroe Bergdorf, in which white people are excoriated as inherently racist and “the most violent and oppressive force of nature on earth”.  Bergdorf, who was previously given a platform by the BBC when cosmetics firm L’Oreal sacked them for similar racist comments, was speaking on the October 12th edition of the BBC This Week current affairs programme.  “What kind of country is modern Britain? No doubt it’s a country that likes to think of itself as inclusive, but that depends on where you’re standing,” Bergdorf complained.  “For me, as a transgender mixed race person, we live in a deeply racist society.”  ""The uncomfortable truth is that the white race is the most violent and oppressive force of nature on earth"" @MunroeBergdorf in #bbctw film pic.twitter.com/TePO0S1RhX — BBC This Week (@bbcthisweek) October 12, 2017  “Why should we expect anything else from a country that’s built its success on the enslavement of non-white people?” Bergdorf alleged.  “It’s that continuous cycle of racism that explains where we are now. Why does the UK acknowledge the sacrifice of people killed in wars, but not the spilt blood of black people?”  In fact, there are many British memorials commemorating the victims of the slave trade and celebrating its abolition. The oldest, according to Historic England, is the Anti-Slavery Arch in Stroud, Gloucestershire, erected in 1834 by Henry Wyatt to celebrate the passing of the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833.  The most recent appears to have been a memorial erected in June this year to commemorate Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, a parliamentarian who campaigned tirelessly against slavery.  The British probably did more to end the institution of slavery than any other people, following the abolition of the trade at home in 1807 with a sustained, worldwide campaign against the practice.  Arab Muslim slavers in North Africa, who had enslaved white Europeans and black Africans for centuries, were forced to curb their practices after the intervention of the Royal Navy, and British Christian missionaries like Dr. David Livingstone and Dr. John Kirk worked tirelessly to put an end to the related East African slave trade.  TV doc on murder of white schoolboy by racist Pakistanis airs day after ""all whites benefit from racism"" rant on BBC https://t.co/p93ZCNfPz2 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 10, 2017  Bergdorf continued by making the disturbing claim that racism is somehow written into white people’s DNA, telling them they “need to understand that racism is not learned, it’s inherited, and either consciously or unconsciously passed down through privilege” — much like the Abrahamic concept of Original Sin.  “The uncomfortable truth is that the white race is the most violent and oppressive force of nature on earth,” the model concluded.  The police arrest hundreds of people for similar comments about non-white people every year, and encourage the public to report them through its online hate crime portal. The fact that Bergdorf’s comments have been aired by a publicly-funded broadcaster without apparent sanction has resulted in many accusations of double standards on social media.

Sean Copeland, 51, and his 11-year-old son Brodie were among the more than 80 people killed when a truck, whose driver was linked to Islamic State (ISIS), smashed through a crowd of people gathered last July for the Bastille Day fireworks along a popular promenade. The father and son were in Europe on vacation with Sean’s wife, Kim, and his two other children from a previous marriage.  “Kim Copeland is filing this lawsuit hoping that there will be no more funerals where ISIS and others continue to conduct terrorist operations using social media as a tool,” Keith Altman, one of the lawyer’s representing Kim Copeland, told Fox News in an email. “She also wants to see Google, Facebook, and Twitter change their behaviors and act reasonably and responsibly by taking active steps to disrupt ISIS and other nefarious groups’ ability to use their sites to cause death and destruction.”  The complaint, filed Thursday in the northern district of California, argues that the three Silicon Valley-based companies “have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds, and attracting new recruits.”  “Without Defendants Twitter, Facebook, and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible,” the complaint states.  Copeland’s lawsuit is just the latest in a series of legal actions leveled against the three tech companies by Altman on behalf of the families of terror attack victims.  Earlier this month, the family of California man killed in August’s terror attack in Barcelona filled suit against Google, Facebook and Twitter and, in June, Altman brought a case against the companies on behalf of a Jordanian citizen killed in the New Year's Eve terror attack by ISIS at an Istanbul nightclub that left 39 dead.  To date, Altman has leveled seven lawsuits against the three tech giants – alleging that Google, Facebook and Twitter have allowed their social media platforms to be used as a tool to recruit jihadists and that these companies have even profited from advertisements on terrorist propaganda.  Altman and others have begun to argue that social media sites may be violating the provision with their heavily guarded algorithms and that these companies have the resources to monitor any terror activity on their platforms.  “I want to show that there is no social benefit to letting terrorists use social media,” Altman said.",14.0,7.0

Chicago-based Tronc Inc., the publisher of the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune, announced the deal Monday night, and the Daily News posted a story on its website. It was first reported by The New York Times.  Tronc CEO Justin Dearborn said acquiring the paper and its popular website would “provide us with another strategic platform for growing our digital business, expanding our reach and broadening our services for advertisers and marketers,” and both Tronc and Daily News executives said the company would maintain the quality of the paper’s journalism.  “Over the past near-century, the New York Daily News has served New York City and its surrounding areas with its award-winning journalism and helped shape the dynamics of the city,” News owner Mort Zuckerman said in a release. A New York real estate magnate, he had owned the paper since 1993.  The deal puts the Daily News under the umbrella of one of the nation’s major newspaper chains, with properties spanning from the Hartford Courant in Connecticut to the Sun-Sentinel in South Florida.  Tronc — which evolved from Daily News founder the Tribune Co. — gets a presence in the New York media market, a news site with about 25 million unique monthly visitors and other assets. Under the terms of the deal, Tronc said it assumed the Daily News’ operational and pension liabilities and got 100 percent ownership of its Jersey City, New Jersey, printing plant and a 49.9 percent interest in the plant’s 25-acre (10-hectare) property, which overlooks the Manhattan skyline.  With the deal, News Editor-in-Chief Arthur Browne was also named publisher, though he plans to retire at the end of the year.  Founded in 1919, the Daily News considers itself “New York’s Hometown Newspaper,” informing everyday New Yorkers about their city and more. It has been known over the years for zesty headlines — perhaps most notably “Ford to City: Drop Dead” during the New York’s financial woes in 1975 — gossip, city coverage and star columnists that included Jimmy Breslin, Pete Hamill and Liz Smith.  Lately, the tabloid has also attracted attention with its unsparing criticism of President Donald Trump. (Trump, in return, branded the paper “worthless” and Zuckerman “dopey” in tweets last year.)  The Daily News and ProPublica together won this year’s Pulitzer Prize in public service journalism for uncovering how authorities used an obscure law to evict hundreds of people, mostly poor minorities, from their homes. It was the Daily News’ 11th Pulitzer Prize, and the fifth during Zuckerman’s tenure.  But the paper has also contended with the shifts in news consumption and advertising that have affected newspapers in general in the digital age. The newspaper industry has been suffering for years from declining print circulation and advertising revenue, as readership and ad dollars have shifted online. Online ad sales have increased for newspaper companies, but not always enough to offset the decline in print revenue.  The Daily News also grappled with a muscular hometown tabloid rival, the News Corp.-owned New York Post.  Zuckerman eyed selling the Daily News in 2015 but ultimately took it off the market.",1.0,2.0

1260,2859,10,31,2017,2017-10-31,Associated Press News,Slow flow of human immigration may have doomed Neanderthals," In this Thursday, Dec. 18, 2014 file photo, visitors take pictures of models representing Flores, human and Neanderthal women in the ""Musee des Confluences"", a new science and anthropology museum in Lyon, central France. Neanderthals had a long run in Europe and Asia, but they disappeared about 40,000 years ago after modern humans showed up from Africa. (AP Photo/Laurent Cipriani)  NEW YORK (AP) — What killed off the Neanderthals? It’s a big debate, and now a study says that no matter what the answer, they were doomed anyway.  Our close evolutionary cousins enjoyed a long run in Europe and Asia, but they disappeared about 40,000 years ago after modern humans showed up from Africa.  The search for an explanation has produced many theories including climate change, epidemics, or inability to compete with the modern humans, who may have had some mental or cultural edge.  The new study isn’t intended to argue against those factors, but just to show that they’re not needed to explain the extinction, says Oren Kolodny of Stanford University.  He and colleague Marcus Feldman present their approach in a paper released Tuesday by the journal Nature Communications.  They based their conclusion on a computer simulation that represented small bands of Neanderthals and modern humans in Europe and Asia. These local populations were randomly chosen to go extinct, and then be replaced by another randomly chosen population, with no regard for whether it represented the same species.  Neither species was assumed to have any inherent advantage, but there was one crucial difference: Unlike the Neanderthals, the modern humans were supplemented by reinforcements coming in from Africa. It wasn’t a huge wave, but rather “a tiny, tiny trickle of small bands,” Kolodny said.  Still, that was enough to tip the balance against the Neanderthals. They generally went extinct when the simulation was run more than a million times under a variety of assumptions.  If survival was a game of chance, “it was rigged by the fact that there’s recurring migration,” Kolodny said. “The game was doomed to end with the Neanderthals losing.”  Kolodny said the evidence that such migrations actually occurred is suggestive rather than conclusive. Such migrations would not be expected to leave much of an archaeological trace, he said.  Experts in human origins said the paper could help scientists pin down the various factors that led to the Neanderthals’ demise. It fits in with other recent attempts to explain the extinction without assuming behavioral differences between Neanderthals and our ancestors, said Wil Roebroeks of the University of Leiden in the Netherlands. The notion of such differences is largely disproven, he said.  Katerina Harvati of the University of Tuebingen in Germany said while the new work could be useful in solving the extinction mystery, it doesn’t address the question of why modern humans dispersed from Africa into Europe and Asia. It’s important to figure out what was behind that, she said in an email.  ___  Follow Malcolm Ritter at @MalcolmRitter His recent work can be found here.",24.0,13.0

845,2302,10,20,2017,2017-10-20,The New York Times,Opinion | Abortion Ideologues Subvert a Woman’s Rights,"Jane Doe is a 17-year-old undocumented immigrant detained in Texas who is 15 weeks pregnant and is seeking an abortion. The Constitution grants her that right, but the Trump administration is determined to subvert it as part of its war on women’s reproductive rights.  Late Friday, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the teenager must be allowed to have an abortion, but it gave the federal government until Oct. 31 to find her a sponsor so that the government itself does not have to arrange for the procedure. The ruling came hours after the court heard the case, in which the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Refugee Resettlement said that if it released her to see a doctor it would “facilitate” an abortion, an action it said would contradict its interest in “promoting child birth and fetal life.” The government argued that barring an abortion doesn’t place an “undue burden” on her rights because she can always go home to get one — to a Central American country that criminalizes abortion and to parents who are abusive.  This argument is as weak as it is ideologically brazen.  It doesn’t seem to matter to the government that adult women in detention by law have access to abortion, or that this teenager has followed Texas law and obtained a waiver from a state court allowing her to get an abortion without her parents’ consent. And while the Office of Refugee Resettlement refuses to let employees at the shelter where she is being held take her to get an abortion, it ordered them to bring her to a “crisis pregnancy center” with the goal of talking her out of the procedure.  Friday’s ruling lets the government continue to shirk the law until it finds a sponsor. The American Civil Liberties Union was weighing an appeal, potentially to the Supreme Court. Not only the federal government is obstructing Jane Doe’s path; Texas lawmakers have created a hostile environment for reproductive rights. The Supreme Court last year struck down one of the harshest of those laws, but Texas still requires women seeking abortions to first undergo mandatory counseling and an ultrasound, both of which the teenager has done. And the state still bans almost all abortions after 20 weeks, leaving her with about a month before she passes the point at which she will be forced to give birth.",2.0,4.0

Many of us have simply come to terms with this new reality, but thankfully, there are others out there who are staying vigilant and doing their part to ensure that our collective privacy isn’t violated any more than it needs to be.  Such is the case with Google developer Felix Krause, who identified on his blog this week an alarming truth about iOS apps that have access to our phone cameras. According to Krause, apps with the necessary permissions are technically capable of recording the user at any time, regardless of whether or not they have manually pressed a button or issued a command to capture a photo or a video within the app.  But that’s not all they can do. Along with snapping a photo or recording a video, Krause claims that apps can access both front and back cameras, upload pictures and videos right after taking them and even run facial recognition to detect the user’s facial features and expressions using Apple’s Vision framework.  You are probably now wondering what you can do to prevent all those apps you absentmindedly granted permission to from recording you when you least expect it. Unfortunately, short of revoking access from every app on your phone, the only real option is to buy a camera case and uncover the camera when you actually want to take a picture or a video. Otherwise, Apple will need to change how the permissions work to make this impossible.  The good news is that Krause has reported the issue to Apple, so we’ll have to wait and see if anything changes in the coming weeks and months. In the meantime, think before you allow camera permissions to any app.",16.0,19.0

Even so, Democrats sounded the alarm, warning that the aspirational cuts in the budget plan called for slicing more than $1 trillion from Medicaid and about $470 billion from Medicare over a decade.  They also lamented the approach that Republicans are taking on taxes, which mirrors the strategy that they employed in their failed effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. On that matter, Republicans successfully laid the groundwork for a repeal measure that could pass without any Democratic votes, but party leaders could not ultimately get 50 Republican senators to agree on a health bill.  Though Democrats have pleaded to have more say in the tax overhaul, parliamentary language in the budget resolution would allow Republicans to pass a tax bill without any cooperation from the minority party. The tax measure could add as much as $1.5 trillion to budget deficits over a decade.  “Passing this budget is not a requirement for passing tax reform,” said Senator Gary Peters, Democrat of Michigan. “Passing this budget is only a requirement to pass a tax bill with as few votes as possible, without input or buy-in from members of the minority.”  For Republicans, the budget debate provided a moment to showcase their main goal in the coming months: Approving an overhaul of the tax code for the first time in decades, which they hope will lead to greater economic growth.  The House approved its budget resolution, which had long been stalled, on Oct. 5. The House budget also lays the groundwork for a tax bill, but, unlike the Senate’s approach, it calls for the legislation to not add to the deficit.  The House budget resolution also seeks more concrete action when it comes to cutting spending, instructing committees to come up with legislation that would produce at least about $200 billion in savings.  The chairwoman of the House Budget Committee, Representative Diane Black, Republican of Tennessee, had seemed reluctant to jettison that piece of the blueprint. “What part of ‘cut spending’ does @SenateGOP not understand?” she wrote on Twitter last week.

Ron DeSantis (R-FL) spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Thursday regarding a proposed Mueller amendment to limit the special counsel investigation to between March 2015 and the present. The two also discussed tax reform in the House.  DeSantis said, “There are really no limitations to what the special counsel can do in either time or scope, and I thought that that was very dangerous. So my amendment would have limited the time–put up, or shut up if you don’t have anything on this Russia stuff. And then, it would have limited it to the campaign.”  “You can’t go back five or six years just trying to find anything on somebody,” he continued, pointing out that Comey was investigating for a year prior to Mueller, and there is zero evidence of any collusion, which was supposed to be the focus of the entire investigation in the first place.  “I think that from the day after the election,” said DeSantis, “I think the Dems and their allies in the media are like, ‘We’ve got to kneecap this guy no matter what we can do.

The media is so invested in it, even a little speck of dirt gets blown up.”  He added, “In this case, because the special counsel never identified a crime to investigate, he basically can just go and find anybody involved in this campaign: ‘Can we find anything on this person or that person?’ That is not the way the government is supposed to operate.

The firm, the Podesta Group, has lost clients as it has been increasingly drawn into the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. On Monday, the Podesta Group and another company with which it had worked, Mercury Public Affairs, were referenced — though not by name — in an indictment of two former Trump campaign officials, Paul Manafort and Rick Gates.  No charges have been brought against Mr. Podesta or officials from the Podesta Group or Mercury. But both firms have been subpoenaed for records and testimony about their work on behalf of a client referred to them in 2012 by Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates, the European Center for a Modern Ukraine, a nonprofit group based in Brussels.  The work for the European Center, which ended in 2014, was cited in the indictment on Monday as part of a “scheme” by Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates to gain support in Washington for their longtime client, the pro-Russian leader Viktor F.

1388,2997,11,4,2017,2017-11-04,Fox News,Twitter security slammed after rogue employee deactivates Trump's account,"Twitter’s internal security is in the spotlight after a rogue employee briefly deactivated President Donald Trump’s account on Thursday.  The social media site said that the account was taken down by a customer support employee during their last day with the company.  “Amazing. That this could happen to a President's account demonstrates Twitter has poor insider threat controls and indicators,” tweeted Micah Zenko, a foreign policy and national security analyst at international affairs institute Chatham House.  WHAT TWITTER'S 280-CHARACTER LIMIT COULD MEAN FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP AND US POLITICS  Matt Tait, a senior cybersecurity fellow at the Robert Strauss Center, tweeted a series of satirical comments on the incident but warned that the employee involved could be in legal hot water.  “What if someone had hijacked the President's Twitter and issued policies for DHS or DOD that the department wasn't aware it had to implement?,” he tweeted.  “What if the Twitter employee had tweeted about some ongoing terror case and jeopardized it?,” he wrote, in another tweet.  TRUMP MAKE FIRST TWEETS AS PRESIDENT  “What if the Twitter employee tweeted a video of him assaulting a media organization or a political opponent? Imagine the damage to the dignity of the office,” Tait tweeted.  Tait also suggested that the rogue employee could face charges under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). “Going to be boring and say the Twitter employee who deleted Trump for 11 minutes should get an attorney and get ready for CFAA charges,” he tweeted.  Technologies such as artifical intelligence are being touted as a way for companies to gain visibility into their employees working practices. Questions will also inevitably be asked about Twitter’s employee vetting processes.  TRUMP'S TWITTER: COULD HACKERS WREAK HAVOC FROM THE WHITE HOUSE?  Twitter says that it is conducting a “full internal review” into the deactivation of the President’s Twitter account. When contacted by Fox News, Twitter declined to comment beyond its initial tweets.  The President himself addressed the situation early Friday. “My Twitter account was taken down for 11 minutes by a rogue employee. I guess the word must finally be getting out-and having an impact,” he tweeted.  Trump, who has more than 41 million followers on Twitter, turned his @realDonaldTrump account into a powerful political weapon during his run to the White House. Experts, however, have warned that hackers could potentially use the same account to wreak havoc.  JAMES COMEY'S 'SECRET' TWITTER ACCOUNT REVEALED  Trump’s Twitter account has already been hacked, albeit briefly, in 2013, when an unknown attacker tweeted out an offensive lyric by rapper Lil’ Wayne. ""My Twitter has been seriously hacked---and we are looking for the perpetrators,"" tweeted Trump, in response to the incident.  The brief deactivation of Trump’s Twitter account on Thursday also sparked amusement on social media, with some people hailing the rogue employee as a “hero.”  TWITTER SUSPENSION: HERE ARE A FEW ACCOUNTS THAT HAVE BEEN DEACTIVATED  “Dear Twitter employee who shut down Trump's Twitter: You made America feel better for 11 minutes. DM me & I will buy you a Pizza Hut pizza,” tweeted Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu.  This story has been updated to clarify the tone of Matt Tait's tweets.

401,1746,10,5,2017,2017-10-05,Breitbart,Report: Uber iPhone App Could Record Users’ Screens,"A report claims that Uber’s iPhone app was capable of recording users screens, even when they weren’t using the app.  Gizmodo reports that the ride-sharing app Uber was capable of recording users’ iPhone screens even when the app wasn’t being used. The screen recording feature was enabled through a piece of code called an “entitlement,” which allows apps to interact with the iOS phone system, doing everything from sending notifications to allowing access to Apple systems like iCloud and Apple Pay. However, the entitlement that allowed the Uber app to record the iPhone screen was designed as a memory saving feature for the Apple Watch. This entitlement was only present in the 8.2 version of the Uber app.  The idea behind the entitlement was that the iPhone would record the phone’s screen and send the recorded data to the Apple Watch, letting the iPhone’s processor do all the heavy lifting, saving memory on the Apple Watch. According to security researchers, this is not a common entitlement and would have to be approved directly by Apple. Will Strafach, a security researcher and CEO of Sudo Security Group, searched the current Apple app store and was unable to find a single other app with a screen recording entitlement enabled.  “It looks like no other third-party developer has been able to get Apple to grant them a private sensitive entitlement of this nature,” Strafach said. “Considering Uber’s past privacy issues I am very curious how they convinced Apple to allow this.”  Although the entitlement is only designed to be used with the Apple Watch, there are obvious worries that if a hacker was to gain access to Uber’s system, they could potentially capture screenshots of thousands of users’ phones, harvesting passwords and other sensitive information.  Luca Todesco, an iPhone jailbreaker and researcher, explained some of the biggest issues with the entitlement: “Essentially it gives you full control over the framebuffer, which contains the colors of each pixel of your screen. So they can potentially draw or record the screen. It can potentially steal passwords etc.” The feature could also be used to track the apps a user installs on their iPhone.  An Uber spokesperson told Gizmodo that first generation Apple Watches were unable to render detailed maps alone, and the screen recording tool was never used for anything other than rendering these maps. “It was used for an old version of the Apple Watch app, specifically to run the heavy lifting of rendering maps on your phone & then send the rendering to the Watch app,” the spokesperson said. “This dependency was removed with previous improvements to Apple’s OS & our app. Therefore, we’re removing this API from our iOS codebase.”  This was partly due to the tight time frame that Apple gave companies to have their apps ready for the launch of the Apple Watch in 2015, this led to a special permission being given to Uber to use the screen recording entitlement. “Apple gave us this permission years because Apple Watch couldn’t handle our maps rendering. It’s not connected to anything in our current codebase,” Uber’s spokesperson stated.  Uber stated that the screen sharing entitlement is not present in the current version of their app.",45.0,39.0

It was a Friday in late spring, and Ms. Quillen was about to join a conference call with one of the world’s largest parts suppliers. In the automotive food chain, big suppliers like Delphi and Johnson Controls constitute Tier One. They sell directly to the carmakers. D.E.P., which primarily sells to other suppliers, is in Tier Two.  “Tier Ones are eating whole peanuts,” Ms. Quillen says mordantly. “We take the crumbs.”  D.E.P. was trying to take some control over its destiny.  Ms. Quillen was proposing to make a new part used in the transmission of General Motors vehicles. It had taken weeks to design and fabricate a prototype. Now, the little part sat on a conference table in the Tier One’s offices outside Detroit.  Ms. Quillen apologized for dialing in rather than attending the meeting. But it was also true that her own office was where she felt most confident, seated at a large L-shaped desk. On her windowsill were two copies of “Lean In” by Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook. She had been reading the new Ivanka Trump book, “Women Who Work,” which she praised for “good information, good suggestions.”  She sees herself as a driver of people, as a manager who places great demands on her workers and on herself. Others could find her intimidating. On one of her two Dell monitors was a sticky note to herself: “It’s About Feelings.”  “I built a wall around myself,’’ she had said earlier, describing how she rescued the company from years of unprofitability. “If I had allowed myself to be vulnerable, you get hurt, and if you get hurt you start to lose confidence in your ability.’’  “It’s sad, but I became immune to people,” she said.  On the call, the Tier One executive, a woman, expressed interest in the part D.E.P. had designed, but said it would seek competing bids from other injection-molding companies, of which there were many. “It’s our policy that we have to market-test the part,” the executive said. “You’d be competing against other suppliers that have the same capability.”",1.0,2.0

Ms. Raicovich said the decision regarding the Israel event, which was made by the board, simply had to do with an application of the museum’s space rental practice, which has not permitted art fund-raisers, auctions or political events. The board then decided to overrule its initial decision and allow the event upon realizing that a museum official had led the Israeli Ambassador to believe the rental would proceed.  “The decision was not anti-Semitic,” Ms. Raicovich said. “The accusation is very painful. This is not who I am. My grandmother helped young Jewish men escape across the border out of fascist Italy during the war. My husband is the grandson of Holocaust survivors.

The project, which features a white flag with the words “He Will Not Divide Us” filmed round-the-clock by a camera, has already moved several times from New York, to New Mexico and to Liverpool in Britain because of security problems.  Now installed above an art gallery in an old biscuit factory in the French city of Nantes, the flag came under attack overnight Tuesday-Wednesday by a drone, which attempted for several minutes to set it on fire.  The remotely-piloted arson attempt failed when the drone crashed.  “An unauthorised drone carrying a burning piece of cloth approached the flag to try to set it alight. The fireproof flag was undamaged and the attempt failed,” Lieu Unique gallery said in a statement.  The project has been repeatedly targeted by pro-Trump activists since it began at the Museum of the Moving Image in New York on the day of the president’s inauguration, January 20, 2017.  It began as a microphone-equipped camera mounted on a wall of the gallery in the Queens borough where Trump was born, and visitors were invited to chant the words “he will not divide us”.  The footage was live-streamed on the project’s website and was intended to be broadcast for the duration of Trump’s four-year term.  After scuffles and arrests, it travelled to a cinema in Albuquerque, New Mexico until gunshots were reported nearby and then to the Liverpool’s Foundation for Art and Creative Technology (FACT) centre where it was removed after “dangerous trespassing”.  Local radio France Bleu Loire-Ocean reported Wednesday that there had already been “an attempted intrusion” at the gallery in Nantes, which put the flag on display on October 16 and intends to keep it in public view.  The work is the brainchild of “Transformers” star LaBeouf, as well as Finnish artist Nastja Sade Ronkko and British artist Luke Turner.",16.0,15.0
8,96,8,30,2017,2017-08-30,Associated Press News,Want to help? Here’s how to give in Harvey’s wake,"Want to help? Here’s how to give in Harvey’s wake  NEW YORK (AP) — Charities are stepping up their donation requests in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, which has devastated South Texas and on Wednesday hit southwestern Louisiana. At least 18 people have died, and countless residents are displaced from their homes.  While the urge to donate clothes and other supplies is natural, money is the quickest, most effective contribution most people can make during times of disaster, charities and philanthropy experts say. And donating directly through a website gets money to a charity faster than a text donation, even though the text might seem easier.  Here’s how to make sure you are giving in a way that matters the most.  ___  GIVE TO ESTABLISHED RELIEF AGENCIES  GuideStar’s website has a database that lets you vet charities . You can find information on a charity’s expenses, assets and revenue, as well as its programs.  Stacy Palmer, editor of The Chronicle of Philanthropy, also suggests looking at a charity’s website for information on how it will use donations. And look through local news reports for information on a charity’s work, or contact the local United Way and the local Community Foundation — in this case Houston’s.  It’s up to you whether to go with a local charity that might know the area better, or a national charity that has wider reach. Palmer says “both kinds of organizations have their place right now.”  ___  TEXTING TO GIVE?  It might be tempting to make a donation through text and have the phone company charge it on your phone bill. It’s easy, and it might feel as though it’s the quickest way to get money to a charity.  But Palmer says that’s not the case, as charities have to wait for the phone companies to release the money.  The quickest way to give is to go to the charity’s website and donate directly, using a credit or debit card. That said, relief agencies will need money beyond first few days or even weeks, so if the ease of text donations appeals to you, tap away. To donate $10 to the Red Cross via text, send a text message saying “REDCROSS” to the number 90999.  Apple users in the U.S. can also donate to the American Red Cross through the company’s iTunes and app stores. Amounts range from $5 to $200, and you can’t use store credit.  ___  TIMING  Donations often pour in immediately after disaster strikes but peter out during the long recovery process. While there are a lot of immediate needs, Palmer says, “charities are going to need support on the long haul.”  Consider saving some of your money so you can donate again in a few weeks or months. Better yet, set up a recurring donation to support your chosen charity over time.  Some charities will say when they have raised enough for a particular disaster and use any extra money for their general fund, Palmer says. This isn’t bad.  “One of the things this disaster shows is that it’s important to have resilience,” she says. “It’s smart to just give and say that it can be used wherever it’s most needed.”  ___  CROWDFUNDING  Group fundraising services such as GoFundMe let people raise money for friends, families, neighbors or themselves — as well as for charity. As always, do your homework before giving to a stranger or cause online.  GoFundMe has a special page for Hurricane Harvey pleas for charities, individuals and families. GlobalGiving, a crowdfunding site for charities, is trying to raise $2 million for local relief and recovery efforts.  Remember that donations are tax-deductible only if they go to a registered non-profit or charity. Otherwise, they are generally considered gifts.  ___  HOLD OFF ON MATERIAL DONATIONS  Donating food, clothing and household items can complicate and even hinder relief efforts, experts say. After Superstorm Sandy in 2012, for example, reports cited relief agencies not knowing what to do with the piles of clothing and other unsolicited items pouring in.  The U.S. Center for Disaster Information says such donations “require transportation — which is expensive and logistically complicated — and a pre-identified recipient on the ground who will receive the shipment, pay customs and other fees, sort and distribute the items.”  Unsolicited goods, the agency says , are “never required in early stages of response, and they compete with priority relief items for transportation and storage.”  It doesn’t mean there will never be a time or place for such donations — check with relief agencies as time passes. And a few charities have announced immediate needs for material donations; the Houston Humane Society has set up an Amazon wish list for the most needed items.  ___  CONSIDER SPECIAL NEEDS  Seniors, the disabled, children and even pets are particularly vulnerable during disasters. Consider donating to charities that focus on their needs.  The Texas Diaper Bank , for example, says diapers (whether for babies or adults) are not provided by disaster relief agencies. Again, these charities need money — not boxes of diapers you picked up at Costco.  Save The Children is setting up “child-friendly spaces” inside shelters to give kids a safe area to play and get support from trained experts and “get a sense of normalcy” during disasters, spokeswoman Jordyn Linsk said. The organization is also distributing infant and toddler supplies.  Portlight Strategies helps people with disabilities, older adults and their families recover after disasters.  To help animals, check the San Antonio Humane Society, which has set up an emergency fund for pets and strays, or the Houston Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals . And the Houston Humane Society needs money, too.  ___  RELIGIOUS AND HUMANITARIAN GROUPS  Some of the religious organizations are “some of the strongest relief groups,” Palmer says.  Those accepting donations include Catholic Charities USA, International Orthodox Christian Charities , Islamic Relief USA , the Jewish Federations of North America and Tzu Chi USA , a humanitarian organization with Buddhist roots.  ___  CHECK OUT MATCHES  Facebook says it will match every dollar raised through its service, up to $1 million, for the Center for Disaster Philanthropy’s Hurricane Harvey Recovery Fund. The money will support local recovery and rebuilding efforts. U.S. Facebook users are getting a message at the top of their news feed on how to donate.  Google, meanwhile, is matching $1 million in donations to the American Red Cross. To donate, go to http://www.google.org/harvey-relief . The company also matched donations from employees and said Tuesday it donated $750,000 between its nonprofit arm, Google.org, and employee contributions to organizations such as the American Red Cross, Habitat for Humanity and Save the Children.  Some companies, such as the Walt Disney Co., are also matching employee donations.",1.0,1.0
912,2403,10,22,2017,2017-10-22,The New York Times,Opinion | America’s Forever Wars,"Many of these forces are engaged in counterterrorism operations — against the Taliban in Afghanistan, for instance; against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria; against an affiliate of Al Qaeda in Yemen. So far, Americans seem to accept that these missions and the deployments they require will continue indefinitely. Still, it’s a very real question whether, in addition to endorsing these commitments, which have cost trillions of dollars and many lives over 16 years, they will embrace new entanglements of the sort President Trump has seemed to portend with his rash threats and questionable decisions on North Korea and Iran.  For that reason alone, it’s time to take stock of how broadly American forces are already committed to far-flung regions and to begin thinking hard about how much of that investment is necessary, how long it should continue and whether there is a strategy beyond just killing terrorists. Which Congress, lamentably, has not done. If the public is quiet, that is partly because so few families bear so much of this military burden, and partly because America is not involved in anything comparable to the Vietnam War, when huge American casualties produced sustained public protest. It is also because Congress has spent little time considering such issues in a comprehensive way or debating why all these deployments are needed.  Congress has repeatedly ducked efforts by Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, and others to put the war against the Islamic State, which has broad popular support but no specific congressional authorization, on a firm legal footing. President Trump, like his predecessor, insists that legislation passed in 2001 to authorize the war against Al Qaeda is sufficient. It isn’t. After the Niger tragedy, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Corker of Tennessee, has agreed to at least hold a hearing on the authorization issue. It is scheduled for Oct. 30.  Andrew Bacevich, a retired Army colonel who lost a son in Iraq and is a critic of military operations, says that “a collective indifference to war has become an emblem of contemporary America.” The idea that Americans could be inured to war and all its horrors is chilling, and it’s a recipe for dangerous decisions with far-reaching ramifications. There are many factors contributing to this trend:  During earlier wars, including Vietnam, the draft put most families at risk of having a loved one go to war, but now America has all-volunteer armed forces. Less than 1 percent of the population now serves in the military, compared with more than 12 percent in World War II. Most people simply do not have a family member in harm’s way.",6.0,19.0
1477,3138,11,7,2017,2017-11-07,Associated Press News,‘We still need to eat’: Tech boom creates working homeless," In the same affluent, suburban city where Google built its headquarters, Tes Saldana lives in a crowded but tidy camper she parks on the street.  She concedes it’s “not a very nice living situation,” but it also is not unusual. Until authorities told them to move, more than a dozen other RVs filled with people who can’t afford rent joined Saldana on a tree-lined street in Mountain View, parked between a Target and a luxury apartment complex.  Homeless advocates and city officials say it’s outrageous that in the shadow of a booming tech economy - where young millionaires dine on $15 wood-grilled avocado and think nothing of paying $1,000 for an iPhone X - thousands of families can’t afford a home. Many of the homeless work regular jobs, in some cases serving the very people whose sky-high net worth is the reason housing has become unaffordable for so many.  Across the street from Saldana’s camper, for example, two-bedroom units in the apartment complex start at $3,840, including concierge service. That’s more than she brings home, even in a good month.  Saldana and her three adult sons, who live with her, have looked for less rustic accommodations, but rents are $3,000 a month or more, and most of the available housing is distant. She said it makes more sense to stay in the camper near their jobs and try to save for a brighter future, even if a recent city crackdown chased them from their parking spot.  “We still need to eat,” said Saldana, 51. “I still want to bring my kids, once in a while, to a movie, to eat out.”  She cooks and serves food at two hotels in nearby Palo Alto, jobs that keep her going most days from 5 in the morning until 10 at night. Two of her sons, all in their 20s, work at a bakery and pay $700 toward the RV each month. They’re all very much aware of the economic disparity in Silicon Valley.  “How about for us people who are serving these tech people?” Saldana said. “We don’t get the same paycheck that they do.”  It’s all part of a growing crisis along the West Coast, where many cities and counties have seen a surge in the number of people living on the streets over the past two years. Counts taken earlier this year show 168,000 homeless people in California, Oregon and Washington - 20,000 more than were counted just two years ago.  The booming economy, fueled by the tech sector, and decades of under-building have led to an historic shortage of affordable housing. It has upended the stereotypical view of people out on the streets as unemployed: They are retail clerks, plumbers, janitors - even teachers - who go to work, sleep where they can and buy gym memberships for a place to shower.  The surge in homelessness has prompted at least 10 local governments along the West Coast to declare states of emergency, and cities from San Diego to Seattle are struggling to come up with immediate and long-range solutions.  San Francisco is well-known for homeless tent encampments. But the homeless problem has now spread throughout Silicon Valley, where the disparity between the rich and everyone else is glaring.  There is no firm estimate on the number of people who live in vehicles in Silicon Valley, but the problem is pervasive and apparent to anyone who sees RVs lining thoroughfares; not as visible are the cars tucked away at night in parking lots. Advocates for the homeless say it will only get worse unless more affordable housing is built.  The median rent in the San Jose metro area is $3,500 a month, yet the median wage is $12 an hour in food service and $19 an hour in health care support, an amount that won’t even cover housing costs. The minimum annual salary needed to live comfortably in San Jose is $87,000, according to a study by personal finance website GoBankingRates.  So dilapidated RVs line the eastern edge of Stanford University in Palo Alto, and officials in neighboring Mountain View have mapped out more than a dozen areas where campers tend to cluster, some of them about a mile from Google headquarters.  On a recent evening, Benito Hernandez returned to a crammed RV in Mountain View after laying flagstones for a home in Atherton, where Zillow pegs the median value of a house at $6.5 million. He rents the RV for $1,000 a month and lives there with his pregnant wife and children.  The family was evicted two years ago from an apartment where the rent kept going up, nearing $3,000 a month.  “After that, I lost everything,” said Hernandez, 33, who works as a landscaper and roofer.  He says his wife “is a little bit sad because she says, ‘You’re working very hard but don’t have credit to get an apartment.’ I tell her, ‘Just wait, maybe a half-year more, and I’ll get my credit back.’”  The plight of the Hernandez family points out one of the confounding problems of the homeless surge along the West Coast.  “This is not a crisis of unemployment that’s leading to poverty around here,” said Tom Myers, executive director of Community Services Agency, a nonprofit based in Mountain View. “People are working.”  Mountain View, a city of 80,000 which also is home to Mozilla and 23andMe, has committed more than $1 million over two years for homeless services, including money for an outreach case manager and a police officer to help people who live in vehicles. At last count, there were people living in more than 330 vehicles throughout the city.  Mayor Ken Rosenberg is proud of the city’s response to the crisis - focusing not on penalties but on providing services. Yet he’s also worried that the peace won’t last as RVs crowd into bike lanes and over-taxed streets.  Last week, Mountain View officials posted signs banning vehicles more than 6 feet high on some parts of the street where Saldana, Hernandez and others living in RVs were parked, saying they were creating a traffic hazard. The average RV is well over that height.  That follows similar moves over the summer by Palo Alto, which started cracking down on RVs and other vehicles that exceed the 72-hour limit on a busy stretch of El Camino Real.  In San Jose, officials recently approved an ordinance pushed by an interfaith group called the Winter Faith Collaborative to allow places of assembly - including gyms and churches - to shelter homeless people year-round.  Ellen Tara James-Penney, a 54-year-old lecturer at San Jose State University, parks her old Volvo at one of those safe haven churches, Grace Baptist Church, and eats in its dining hall. She is paid $28,000 a year to teach four English classes and is carrying $143,000 in student debt after earning two degrees.  She grades papers and prepares lessons in the Volvo. At night, she leans back the driver’s seat and prepares for sleep, one of two dogs, Hank, by her side. Her husband, Jim, who is too tall for the car, sleeps outside in a tent cot with their other dog, Buddy.  The Bay Area native remembers the time a class was studying John Steinbeck, when another student said that she was sick of hearing about the homeless.  “And I said, ‘Watch your mouth. You’re looking at one.’ Then you could have heard a pin drop,” she said. “It’s quite easy to judge when you have a house to live in or you have meds when you’re depressed and health care.”  In response to growing wealth inequities, unions, civil rights groups and community organizations formed Silicon Valley Rising about three years ago. They demand better pay and benefits for the low-income earners who make the region run.  SEIU United Service Workers West, for example, organized roughly 3,000 security guards who work for companies that contract with Facebook, Google and Caltrain, the mass transit system that connects Silicon Valley with San Francisco.  One of those workers is Albert Brown III, a 46-year-old security officer who recently signed a lease for half of a $3,400 two-bedroom unit in Half Moon Bay, about 13 miles from his job.  He can barely afford the rent on his $16-an-hour salary, even with overtime, but the car that doubled as his home needed a pricey repair and he found a landlord willing to overlook his lousy credit. Still, Brown worries he won’t be able to keep up with his payments.  His feet have been hurting. What if a doctor tells him to rest for a few days or a week?  “I can’t miss a minute. If I miss a minute or a shift? No way, man. A week? Forget it, it’s over. It’s all downhill from there,” he said.  “It’s a sad choice. I have to decide whether to be homeless or penniless, right?”  ___  Follow Janie Har at https://twitter.com/search?q=Janie%20Har&src=typd  Follow AP’s complete coverage of the homeless crisis here: https://apnews.com/tag/HomelessCrisis",13.0,16.0

It’s a satellite from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration peering down on Hurricanes Katia and Irma and Tropical Storm Jose (from left to right) on September 8.  It’s an image that sums up what a punishing Atlantic hurricane season it has been. From late August to early October, it seemed that just as one storm was barreling west, another was spinning up right behind it.  Irma, the center storm in this image, broke a new record for hurricane intensity by sustaining 185 mph winds for 36 hours. In the days after this image was taken, Jose would obtain major hurricane status (Category 3), marking the first time on record where two Atlantic storms had 150 mph winds at the same time. Just a week later, Hurricane Maria would form and eventually knock out Puerto Rico’s power grid, setting off a terrible ongoing humanitarian disaster.  And the toll of these storms has been deadly and costly. We still don’t have an accurate death toll from Maria’s destructive path through Puerto Rico, a storm that could end up costing the cash-strapped island around $95 billion. Hurricanes Harvey and Irma are estimated to have caused $200 billion in damage. It’s been 12 years since storms of this intensity have made landfall in the US. Their return this year is, foremost, a reminder: We’re vulnerable.  Now that hurricane season is officially ending today (woo!), November 30, it’s right to ask: What the hell just happened?  Is it normal to have so many strong storms in a row? And how should we think about this season in relation to climate change? To take stock, earlier in the season I called up several climate and hurricane experts.  This season broke records  There are a lot of ways to measure the severity of a hurricane season: You can look at the number of storms, the number of days with at least one active hurricane, and a measure called “accumulated cyclone energy” (a measure of wind speeds accumulating over time). On all the measures, 2017 is trending near the top, explains Philip Klotzbach, an atmospheric scientist and hurricane expert at Colorado State University.  Since the beginning of the season, Klotzbach has been obsessively keeping track of the storms in a way, he says, that straddles the line of work and hobby. And he’s compiled a lot of records.  Here are a few, by his count:  2017 saw more major hurricanes than in all but the heaviest seasons, with six achieving Category 3 (111-plus mph winds) or higher. The record since stat-keeping began in 1851 is seven. (Though keep in mind we’ve only been tracking hurricanes with satellites since the 1970s, so the early records likely aren’t very comprehensive.)  2017 had 19.25 days with a major named storm in the Atlantic, the sixth-highest number of such days.  2017 is the seventh highest for accumulated cyclone energy in the Atlantic.  Here’s the entire record sheet compiled by Klotzbach.  Why was this season so active? It’s complicated.  So what happened? Why did we see storm after storm after storm?  The experts I spoke to all said there’s no simple explanation for the number of hurricanes that can form in a given year. But “it’s a lot more nuanced than to say you warm the water and you get a lot more storms,” Klotzbach says.  Yes, warm waters are a key ingredient to fuel storms. But hurricanes are also influenced and steered by massive global trends in weather that are hard to predict: The warming or cooling of waters in the Pacific (El Niño and La Niña) and patterns like the Madden-Julian oscillation (an eastward-moving weather system that circles the globe every month or so and makes thunderstorms more likely) all play a role.  This year, the Atlantic was warmer than average — Klotzbach says August through October will likely rank third or fourth in terms of highest tropical Atlantic Ocean temperatures.  But that’s not enough to create an active year for storms. What also happened: The tropical Pacific was cooler than usual. When the Pacific is cool, that’s when “you tend to get a lot more activity in the Atlantic,” explains Princeton climate scientist Gabriel Vecchi. Those cooler Pacific waters help cool the upper atmosphere.  Big temperature differences between the surface and the upper atmosphere are another ingredient needed to form hurricanes. Temperature gradients make the atmosphere more unstable, and “a more unstable atmosphere is more conducive for deep thunderstorm formation, which is the building blocks of hurricanes,” Klotzbach says. In May, the NOAA predicted the 2017 hurricane season would be above normal, citing cooling waters in the Pacific and predicting two to four major hurricanes.  Finally, there was low wind shear throughout the season. Wind shear is the sudden changes in wind direction as you get higher and higher in the atmosphere. High wind shear tends to blow the tops off storms and saps them of their strength. “[Low wind shear] is the reason why storms like Irma were able to maintain 180 mph intensity for a day and a half,” Klotzbach says.  Naturally, there are years where hurricane activity is intense and years where it remits. In 2005 there were so many storms that forecasters had to dip into the Greek alphabet for names. But then wasn’t another major hurricane landfall in the United States for 12 years. (Hurricane Harvey broke the streak.)  But the “drought” we’ve experienced since 2005 is a bit of a misnomer. Hurricanes aren’t just an Atlantic phenomenon. Tropical cyclones — which are called typhoons, cyclones, or hurricanes depending on where you are — form in tropical regions the world over. Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest storms ever recorded on Earth, hit the Philippines in 2013, killing 6,300 people, during the so-called drought. And Cuba was hit by major hurricanes four times from 2006 to 2016, Klotzbach reminds.  Bottom line: Hurricanes are extremely complicated. No one variable causes them. They are the result of the impossibly complicated patterns of global weather. 2017 was a strong season due to warm Atlantic waters, a cooler upper atmosphere, and nothing in the weather to blow the storms apart or steer them away from our shores.  Was it climate change? It’s complicated.  One of the thing that made the 2017 season feel like a sign of climate change was that Harvey, Irma, and Maria all made landfall as powerful Category 4 storms with winds exceeding 130 mph. And Harvey, in particular, dumped a truly staggering amount of rain over Houston. These are the types of storms climate scientists to expect to see more of in a warmer world.  It’s prompted several journalists to ask if the very powerful, deadly hurricanes this year represent a “new normal” in the age of global warming. Some even insisted that we call them “climate disasters.”  “Make no mistake: These storms weren’t natural,” meteorologist Eric Holthaus wrote for Grist in September. “A warmer, more violent atmosphere — heated up by our collective desire to ignore the fact that we live on a planet where such devastation is possible — juiced Harvey and Irma’s destruction.”  But the story linking climate change to any current storms is not so simple.  “When we get a particularly bad storm, people often try and attribute it to something larger,” Jennifer Collins, a hurricane researcher at the University of South Florida, says. “In the past, El Niño was often to blame. These days, more often people ask about a climate change connection. Attributing a single storm to anything, whether it is climate change or something else, is difficult.”  First off, yes: There’s consensus that the science of climate change predicts that in a warming world, hurricanes will become more intense, carry more rain, and cause worse coastal flooding linked in part to sea level rise.  But here the thing: We don’t yet currently know, conclusively, that the storms we saw were made larger and nastier by climate change. “At this point it’s really uncertain if there’s any detectable human influence on any hurricane or tropical cyclone metric,” Tom Knutson, an NOAA meteorologist who studies hurricanes, says. There’s just not enough data.  Vecchi admits, “We’re in an uncomfortable position, because it is not clear we should be able to see [increasing hurricane strength] in the data yet.”  Sure, the NOAA’s National Hurricane Center has airplanes that fly through storms to obtain hour-by-hour barometric pressure and wind speed data. But all this technology is relatively new. Meteorologists have only been tracking hurricanes with satellites since the 1970s. It’s possible that historic hurricane records, which go back to the 1800s, are incomplete or have inaccurate information on wind speeds and size. Considering how hurricanes have been lashing against the Atlantic’s coasts for untold epochs, we just have a tiny slice of data to determine what’s “normal.”  We have much better — and more conclusive — evidence for climate change from more boring sources like global temperature averages, or the extent of global sea ice, or thousands of years’ worth of C02 levels stored frozen in ice cores. “The more volatile the phenomenon, the harder it is to detect trends,” Klotzbach says. And hurricanes are an extremely volatile phenomenon.  Hurricanes are certainly influenced by global temperatures. But it’s such a complicated system it’s hard to see that unfolding in real time. Instead, scientists will need months to complete in-depth “attribution studies” to tease out climate change’s influence on these storms.  That isn’t to say there aren’t some clues that climate change is currently making storms more intense. “Studies have also noted that in a warmer environment, we should see more storms which undergo rapid intensification,” Collins says. “We have seen such rapid intensifications with Hurricane Wilma, Rita, Katrina, Patricia, and Harvey.”  But those clues don’t add up to a slam-dunk case.  All the climate scientists I spoke to for this story agreed on this point. “We can’t say with 100 percent [certainty] yet that there was influence in these specific storms from climate change,” says Suzana Camargo, who studies extreme weather at Columbia University.  What they can and will do is run model simulations. Scientists will run a model of the storm but adjust for climate change–derived changes in CO2. From those models, they can make estimates about whether a storm’s wind or rain output was influenced by climate change.  “In the case of Hurricane Harvey, we had this huge amount of precipitation,” Camargo says. “When people do studies on Harvey, my expectation would be that part of it will be a slight contribution from climate change.”  Don’t think of this hurricane season as a “new normal.” Think of it as a new baseline.  Vecchi offers a different way to frame the story on climate change and hurricanes that I find very helpful.  Think of the storms we saw this year not as the “new normal” but as the baseline. “Our [current] vulnerability to these hurricanes really highlights to me the seriousness to which we should look at the predictions for the future,” he says.  If things can be so bad now, just think of what the future might hold.  Because even if the predictions don’t turn out to be correct — if hurricanes don’t grow larger and carry more rain — if there’s sea level rise due to climate change, these storms become more devastating. Storm surge — the mass of water hurricanes push onshore from the ocean — will have a higher bed of water that will rush farther inland and destroy more property.  “There’s also a really strong connection between temperature of air and its ability to hold water,” Vecchi says. “As the planet warms, we have a good basis to think that the extreme rainfall should increase.”  Hurricanes are one of the biggest, baddest, most in-your-face weather events we have. And so there are compelling reasons to use fierce ones to tell a story about climate change.  But I worry that using them to herald the coming of a new, more dangerous world will backfire on climate activists. Even in a steadily warming world, we’re likely to see many periods of hurricane “drought.” What happens to the warnings then?  “You want to keep your eye on the real ball,” Vecchi says. “When we have such strong evidence [for climate change], when there are things that we understand so well, why are we going to build a case around something that is a little more tenuous?”  What’s not complicated: more strong hurricanes are coming  We don’t need the threat of climate change to know that hurricanes are a dangerous threat. They’ve inflicted grave damage on coastal communities for as long as we’ve had them.  On the 1940s and into the ’50s, South Florida was hit by five Category 4 or 5 hurricanes in six years. And yet since then, the South Florida coastline has only grown more densely populated, reaching a population of 6 million in 2016. And Tampa, on the Gulf side of Florida, is one of the fastest-growing cities in the country. The greatest threat is not from climate change but from the hubris to build so much in regions where we know hurricanes will continue to land.  “Islands in the Caribbean are very vulnerable to a strong hurricane, and Florida is vulnerable to a hurricane when one hits, and Houston is really vulnerable to flooding,” says Rebecca Morss, who studies the sociological aspects of extreme weather at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. “It’s just a matter of is the extreme rainfall going to happen now, or in 10 years? Hurricanes are going to come.” And that risk is hard for people to grapple with. Sure, in any given year, your personal risk of being hit by a hurricane is low. But if you’re living in a house on the coast for 30-plus years, you just might be impacted.  This year’s brutal hurricane season has given us a multitude of opportunities to reduce risks for the next inevitable brutal season, whenever it comes. We can rebuild Puerto Rico’s electrical system to be more resilient to extreme weather. Houston can grapple with its land use policies that have made it so flood-prone. South Florida can reconsider its trajectory to continue building more and more expensive real estate. We can talk more seriously about strategic retreat from our most vulnerable coastal areas. We can come up with a better long-term plan to pay for the damages from severe storms.  Here’s one positive note to end on. The climate and weather experts I spoke to all agreed: Hurricane forecasting keeps getting better year over year. Today, forecasts 120 hours out are more accurate than the 48-hour forecasts were in the 1970s. The data isn’t yet in for 2017, but it’s looking like the forecast tracks were pretty accurate.  This year, forecasters were able to warn days in advance that Hurricane Irma was going to turn toward Florida. This allowed emergency managers and leaders to make critical decisions around evacuation orders and readying supplies that undoubtedly saved many lives.  So more hurricanes are coming. They’ll likely grow bigger and more intense. And we’ll see them coming. But we need to start preparing now.",3.0,5.0

107,620,9,8,2017,2017-09-08,Associated Press News,Equifax breach sows chaos among 143M Americans,"This July 21, 2012, photo shows Equifax Inc., offices in Atlanta. Credit monitoring company Equifax says a breach exposed social security numbers and other data from about 143 million Americans. The Atlanta-based company said Thursday, Sept. 7, 2017, that ""criminals"" exploited a U.S. website application to access files between mid-May and July of this year. (AP Photo/Mike Stewart)  NEW YORK (AP) — A day after credit-reporting company Equifax disclosed that “criminals” had stolen vital data about 143 million Americans, it had somehow managed to leave much of the public in the dark about their exposure, how they should protect themselves and what Equifax planned to do for those affected.  The breach is unquestionably serious. It exposed crucial pieces of personal data that criminals could use to commit identity theft, from Social Security numbers and birthdates to address histories and legal names.  That data — the “crown jewels of personal information,” in the words of independent credit analyst John Ulzheimer — can’t be changed, and once it’s in circulation, it’s basically out there forever.  But Equifax’s response has satisfied almost no one.  UNHAPPINESS EVERYWHERE  Consumers complained of jammed phone lines and uninformed representatives. An Equifax website set up to help people determine their exposure looked like a scam to some, and provided inconsistent and unhelpful information to others. Congress planned hearings.  Anders Ohlsson, a 47-year-old technical manager in Scotts Valley, California, called a hotline multiple times and was disconnected; entered the last six digits of his Social Security number into Equifax’s emergency website; and finally spoke with a call center manager. He still doesn’t know whether his information has been compromised.  “I don’t think I’ve gotten hold of a person that actually cares,” he said. “Now they’re fumbling to tell people what’s going on. But they really don’t know what’s going on.”  Equifax plays a key role in the financial industry, making this breach more alarming than previous ones at Yahoo or retailers. The company is a storehouse of personal information, like how much people owe on their houses and whether they have court judgments against them.  Lenders rely on the information collected by three big credit bureaus — Equifax, TransUnion and Experian — to help them decide on financing for homes, cars and credit cards. Credit checks are sometimes done by employers when deciding whom to hire for a job.  WHAT YOU CAN DO  Even if you don’t know if you’re one of the 143 million, you might want to consider extreme protective measures.  Your strongest immediate option involves placing a credit freeze on their files with the major credit bureaus. That locks down your information, making it impossible for outsiders to open new accounts and bank cards in your name. But it also blocks you from opening new accounts, and might involve fees depending on the state you live in.  “The credit freeze is the nuclear option of credit protection,” said Matt Schulz, an analyst with CreditCards.com. “But in the wake of a breach this big, it’s worth considering.”  You should also be more diligent about checking your credit reports, where you can see if anyone has opened unauthorized accounts in your name . You can get those files for free once a year from the three major bureaus; use the official site, annualcreditreport.com .  It’s best to spread those requests out by getting one every four months. And you’ll need to be ready to keep checking for a while — potentially years.  “Bad guys can be very patient with data,” Schulz said.  If you’re not ready for the freeze, Ulzheimer recommends setting up fraud alerts on your files. These force creditors to contact you directly, usually by phone, for approval before approving an account.  And if you’ve been a victim of repeated identity fraud, you can request a new Social Security number with the Social Security Administration.  In addition to the emergency Equifax website, https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com/, you can also call 866-447-7559 for information. The company also says it will send mail to all who had personally identifiable information stolen.  HOW EQUIFAX REACTED  Any data breach threatens to tarnish a company’s reputation, but Equifax hasn’t done much to minimize that damage.  Atlanta-based Equifax said Thursday the breach took place between mid-May and July of this year. It discovered the hack July 29, but waited until Thursday to warn consumers. Its communications with the public have so far been limited to official statements.  Then there’s the company’s emergency-information website. To Georgia Weidman, founder and chief technology officer for security firm Shevirah, it looks a lot like the kind of site scammers would use to trick people into giving up passwords or other crucial information.  “It’s teaching people entirely the wrong things about using the internet securely,” Weidman said. She said says she’s also troubled by Equifax’s approach to security generally, including reports that it didn’t respond to basic scripting bugs it was warned about last year.  Company officials are also under scrutiny. Three Equifax executives sold shares worth a combined $1.8 million just a few days after the company discovered the breach, according to documents filed with securities regulators. Equifax said the three executives — one of them the company’s chief financial officer — didn’t know about the breach at the time of the sales, but didn’t answer further questions.  Equifax’s security lapse could be the largest theft involving Social Security numbers, one of the most common ways to confirm a person’s identity in the U.S. It eclipses a 2015 hack at health insurer Anthem Inc. that involved the Social Security numbers of about 80 million people .  FALLOUT  Washington regulators and politicians swiftly criticized Equifax, and Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said he will call for congressional hearings.  An Equifax requirement that appeared to force affected customers into arbitration also drew a backlash. Democrats in the House and Senate called on the company to pull back from language that suggested anyone who signs up for credit monitoring also gives up their right to join a class-action lawsuit against Equifax.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the nation’s chief watchdog for financial services, likewise blasted the arbitration requirement. The CFPB recently passed a rule requiring financial companies to let customers sue together when a large group has been wronged.  New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman said he was starting his own investigation.  After a day of all that, Equifax released a statement Friday evening declaring that the arbitration requirement and class-action waiver will not apply to this particular breach. The company also said it had fixed problems with the emergency website and tripled its call center team to over 2,000 agents.  Equifax shares fell about 13 percent to $123.75 in heavy trading. The decline equates to about $2.28 billion in lost market value.  ___  AP Technology Writers Michael Liedtke and Ryan Nakashima in San Francisco, and Matt O’Brien in New York, contributed to this report.",2.0,2.0
126,775,6,6,2017,2017-06-06,Vox,"Russia's attempt to hack US election officials, explained","Russia’s GRU intelligence agency attempted to hack the computers of voting officials across the country in the days before the 2016 presidential election, according to a top secret National Security Agency document that was leaked to the Intercept.  The attacks focused on voter registration systems rather than voting machines themselves, so there’s no evidence that the Russian government directly changed anyone’s vote. But there’s also a lot we can’t tell from the report about what the Russians might have accomplished — and whether they could have altered the election result, directly or indirectly.  We can speculate, though, on what the Russians could have done after they gained access to the election officials’ computers. For example, they could have deleted records for voters registered with one party to help candidates of the other party. Deleted voters would have still been able to vote, but they would have had to cast provisional ballots — a cumbersome process that could have discouraged some from casting their votes.  Attackers could also have simply caused registration systems to crash in precincts that were likely to vote heavily for one candidate over the other. That could have caused delays and long lines that would suppress turnout in those precincts.  At least one jurisdiction using EV Systems voting technology experienced serious glitches on election day: Durham, North Carolina. The voter registration system there malfunctioned, leading to long lines. Officials there say they don’t believe they were hacked — they say the problems they encountered appeared to be the result of user error. But Alex Halderman, a computer security expert at the University of Michigan, points out that if a sophisticated hacker were targeting American elections, it would do what it could to make any glitches appear to be accidents rather than deliberate sabotage.  The most alarming possibility, Halderman says, is that hackers could use access to these officials’ computers as a “stepping stone” to attack voting machines themselves.  To be clear, we have no evidence they did this, but the officials who manage voter registration records often work closely with those who manage voting machines themselves. So gaining access to voter registration systems could be a first step to hacking voting machines themselves.  “The Russians not only carried out this targeted leaking and information warfare style campaign to interfere with the election,” Halderman said, “they were also taking major steps down the route of trying to interfere with the mechanics of the election by targeting a voting system vendor and their customers who are election officials.”  Halderman argues that the report highlights the need for more investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 election as well as further steps to shore up America’s election infrastructure ahead of the 2018 and 2020 elections.  “I hope we learn more about this and it becomes part of a larger investigations into what’s going on,” says Joe Hall, chief technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology. “If it was a dedicated campaign by the GRU, they're not going to settle for attacking one podunk vendor, they'll try many different things.”  In short, cybersecurity has become one of the biggest challenges to running a secure and trustworthy election. We have a lot more work to do to find out what happened in 2016 and how to make sure something even worse doesn’t happen in future elections.  The government arrested a suspected leaker within hours  The Intercept published its story, and a full copy of the report, on Monday afternoon. Within hours, the Justice Department announced that it had arrested 25-year-old contractor Reality Winner for leaking a classified document that corresponds to the document the Intercept obtained. The government claims that Winner confessed to the leak after being confronted by federal officials.  In a blistering tweetstorm, Washington Post investigative reporter Bart Gellman criticized the Intercept’s handling of the story. Gellman, who became famous in 2013 for breaking the Snowden disclosures alongside Intercept founder Glen Greenwald, argued that the Intercept endangered its source by telling the government the document was sent from Augusta, Georgia, (Winner lives in the area) and by providing the government with a photocopy of the document that could be forensically traced back to the printer that printed it.  How the attacks worked  According to the NSA, the Russian government began its hacking efforts by attempting to infiltrate an American election technology vendor that the Intercept says is a Florida-based company called VR Systems. The attackers used a “spear phishing” technique, sending personalized emails to several employees of the company to try to trick the employees into entering their passwords into a fake Google login form.  “It is unknown whether the aforementioned spear-phishing deployment successfully compromised all the intended victims, and what potential data from the victim could have been exfiltrated,” the report says. “However, based on subsequent targeting, it was likely that at least one account was compromised.”  Next, the attackers posed as employees of the voting technology company to attack election officials in jurisdictions that used the company’s products. Using real documentation stolen from VR Systems, the hackers created malicious Microsoft Word documents that compromise a victim’s computer when they are opened. The documentation was for EVid, software that manages the voter checkin process at a polling place.  The attackers sent out malicious emails to 122 election officials around the country — America has a decentralized election system managed by thousands of state and local officials. The hackers hoped that by posing as a VR Systems employee and sending out what looked like real voting software documentation, they could avoid arousing the suspicions of election officials. “It is likely that the threat actor was targeting officials involved in the management of voter registration systems,” according to the NSA.  Unfortunately, this is as far as the leaked document goes in telling the story. We don’t know how many of those 122 election officials clicked on the malicious link and had their computers compromised. We don’t know if Russian spies did anything malicious once they gained access. It’s possible that most of the officials avoided clicking on the malicious links.  Experts say we need to do more to secure our elections  Both Halderman and Hall say the fact that the Russians were trying to build the capability to tamper with elections should give policymakers a sense of urgency about this issue. It’s a safe bet that this won’t be the last time that foreign powers try to manipulate the results of an American election, and there’s a lot more that can be done to hack-proof the election process.  The first step, Halderman says, is to ensure that 100 percent of votes are recorded in a voter-verified paper format. That could mean casting votes on a paper ballot and counting them with an optical-scan voting machine. Or it could mean having touchscreen machines print out a paper ballot that the voter checks before leaving the voting booth. Either way, this will allow election officials to conduct a meaningful audit of the results, ensuring that the electronic tally matches up with the paper record.  Next, both Halderman and Hall recommended that states establish routine and statistically rigorous recount procedures. Performing recounts automatically would avoid the situation in 2016, where the decision to do a recount was seen as calling into question the legitimacy of the election outcome. And modern techniques allow jurisdictions to perform statistically rigorous audits at a small fraction of the cost of a statewide recount. The problems is that most states haven’t changed their laws to allow officials to perform these kinds of audits.  The combination of paper ballots and automatic recounts not only makes it more likely that we’d find out if an election was hacked. It could also deter foreign governments from attempting to hack an election knowing that the attempt would likely be defeated.  Finally, Hall says that it might make sense to shift more election funding to the federal level. Given a choice between investing in fixing potholes or securing elections, Hall says, most local officials will spend money on potholes. Dedicated funding from the federal government would help to ensure that even smaller jurisdictions have the resources to properly equip and train their elections officials to maintain election security against foreign threats.",2.0,2.0

When the Latino Victory group released a disgusting video (see below) a couple of days ago, many thought that it was made to resemble terror attacks that have become all too common in European nations. Sadly, today, that concept of using a truck as a weapon to kill innocent people became a reality in New York City, as an Islamic terrorist driver used a rented Home Depot truck as a weapon to kill 9 innocent people and to injure dozens more.  Note to Democrats: Creating a terror-inspired ad with a man chasing down innocent kids in a truck through their neighborhood is not funny, and it’s definitely not a clever way to get people to vote for your candidate.  According to FOX News – Democratic candidate for Virginia governor Ralph Northam is not distancing himself from the controversial ad suggesting supporters of Republican candidate Ed Gillespie are seen as Confederates who attack minority children.  The new opposition ad titled “American Nightmare” was released Monday by Democratic group Latino Victory Fund (LVF) and is scheduled to run through Election Day.

267,1590,10,4,2017,2017-10-04,Vox,Top Republican senator: there are 3 officials keeping US from “chaos”,"A top Senate Republican said there are three key Cabinet officials who are keeping President Donald Trump’s administration from sending the nation into “chaos.”  Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN), who hasn’t been afraid to speak his mind about Trump or his administration lately, told reporters Wednesday that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense James Mattis, and Chief of Staff Gen. John Kelly are “those people that help separate our country from chaos,” whereas others in the administration act without considering national security.  Corker, the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who last month announced he would not run for reelection in 2018, was responding to a question about Tillerson’s rumored desire to resign from the administration.  “I deal with people throughout the administration, and [Tillerson], from my perspective, is in an incredibly frustrating place,” Corker said. “[Tillerson, Mattis, and Kelly] act in a very — they work very well together to make sure the policies we put forth around the world are sound and coherent, and there are other people within the administration whom I believe don’t.”  He went on to say those three top Trump officials are key to the “national security of our nation.”  Tillerson held an unscheduled press conference Wednesday morning in response to an NBC report that he had previously called Trump a “moron” and wanted to quit by July. The secretary of state, who has repeatedly been publicly undermined on foreign dealings in the Middle East and with North Korea, denied the report and said he had no intention of resigning.  Corker said he would not go into details of his private conversations with Tillerson but said he could see why the secretary would be frustrated.  “As I watch, and I can watch very closely in many occasions, [Tillerson] ends up not being supported in the way I would hope a secretary of state would be supported,” Corker said. “I have no knowledge of the comments or anything else. I think he’s in a very trying situation, trying to solve many of the world’s problems, a lot of times without the support and help that I’d like to see him have.”  This isn’t the first time Corker has said Trump and his administration could risk the nation’s security. In August, he said that “the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability, nor some of the competence, that he needs to demonstrate in order for him to be successful,” adding that Trump’s lack of understanding of America’s “character” could put the nation “through great peril.”  He recently told reporters that he stands by those statements — and from the sound of his comments Wednesday, he is also willing to expand on them.

News of the settlement deal, reported last week by the Louisville Courier-Journal, prompted Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin to hold a news conference Saturday, at which he called upon “every individual” in the Statehouse linked to a sexual harassment settlement to resign.  Bevin mentioned no names, but said the scandal involved “multiple events and multiple people.”  “I am calling ... for the immediate resignation of every individual who has settled a sexual harassment case who is party to trying to hide this type of behavior,” Bevin said.  ""I am calling ... for the immediate resignation of every individual who has settled a sexual harassment case who is party to trying to hide this type of behavior."" — Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin  The Republican stressed that the allegations have not been denied and that they “were not isolated to a single person or a single event but involve multiple events and multiple people.”  The Courier-Journal initially reported that House Speaker Jeff Hoover, a Republican, had settled a sexual harassment claim outside of court with one of his staffers.  Then on Saturday, the newspaper reported that the settlement involved three other lawmakers as well as Hoover’s chief of staff.  The newspaper identified the others as Reps. Jim DeCesare of Rockfield, Brian Linder of Dry Ridge and Michael Meredith of Brownsville, all Republicans, and chief of staff Ginger Wills, citing sources with knowledge of the deal.  As Bevin was leaving the news conference, a reporter asked if the governor wanted Hoover to resign.  “You heard me,” Bevin said.  Hoover said Saturday that he has no plans to resign, and he accused the governor of ""grandstanding,"" the Courier-Journal reported.  Hoover has refused to confirm or deny the settlement. But in a private meeting with House Republicans, Hoover said he was ""legally"" prohibited from talking about it and said he had asked for forgiveness from his family, according to Republican state Rep. Wesley Morgan who attended the meeting.  Saturday, House GOP leaders issued a news release saying they planned to hire a private law firm to investigate the allegations. The leaders said they had not consulted Hoover about the decision, but had told him about it. The release said the investigators would have the power to subpoena witnesses.  ""Speaker Hoover, as of now, has the support of the Republican caucus to remain in his leadership position,"" according to a statement attributed to Speaker Pro Tem David Osborne, Majority Leader Jonathan Shell, Majority Whip Kevin Bratcher and Majority Caucus chairman David Meade. ""And we reserve the right, based on the results of the investigation, to revisit the status of anyone involved, including Speaker Hoover.""  But Hoover does not have the support of all Republican lawmakers. Morgan, the Republican state representative from Richmond, posted on his Twitter account that Hoover should resign immediately. He accused Hoover and other Republican leaders of conspiring to hide allegations of sexual harassment, including threatening whistleblowers ""with loss of employment and physical intimidation.""  Morgan told the Courier-Journal that he doesn’t care if he gets run out of politics for speaking up.  ""I'm not going to go along to get along,"" he told the newspaper Saturday. ""And if people have been guilty – I'm saying IF people have been guilty of doing these things – they have no place in state politics.""  The Associated Press contributed to this story.",12.0,2.0

LaCanfora spoke on NFL Today host “J.B.” or James Brown about where Colin Kaepernick is today, and why he has remained silent during his quest to find a job in the NFL.  LaCanfora told J.B. that Kaepernick is “not planning on kneeling.

1443,3078,11,6,2017,2017-11-06,Associated Press News,"Trump: Texas mass shooting is about mental health, not guns","President Donald Trump speaks, accompanied by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during a joint news conference at the Akasaka Palace, Monday, Nov. 6, 2017, in Tokyo. Trump is on a five country trip through Asia traveling to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. (Kiyoshi Ota/Pool Photo via AP)  TOKYO (AP) — Responding to a U.S. mass shooting for the second time in six weeks, President Donald Trump said Monday that it wasn’t “a guns situation” that was behind the slayings of more than two dozen worshippers at a Texas church a day earlier.  As he did following last month’s Las Vegas massacre of 58 people, Trump resisted any discussion of gun control during a news conference in Tokyo, where he was beginning his first presidential trip to Asia. Instead, Trump characterized the shooting as a “mental health problem at the highest level.” Yet White House officials said Trump is unlikely to call for a specific policy response, as he did after last week’s Islamic State group-inspired truck attack, which killed eight people in New York City.  Devin Kelley, the Texas gunman, was discharged from the Air Force several years ago for assaulting his spouse and a child, the Air Force said.  “This was a very — based on preliminary reports — a very deranged individual. A lot of problems over a long period of time,” Trump said when asked about the shooting as he and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe held a joint news conference.  Speaking from Tokyo, President Donald Trump called the deadly church shooting in Texas Sunday ""an act of evil."" (Nov. 5)  Trump’s more muted response to gun violence contrasts with his swift call for legislative and military action following the Oct. 31 truck attack in New York City. Within hours of a rental truck ramming through a crowded bicycle path and into a school bus, Trump called for Congress to “immediately” repeal the diversity visa lottery program that suspect Sayfullo Saipov, an Uzbekistan citizen, used to enter the country in 2010. Trump also claimed that the U.S. had already stepped up its retaliation against the Islamic State group after the attack.  “We are hitting them 10 times harder,” he said Friday.  After the Las Vegas shooting, Trump and aides said it was inappropriate to consider a policy response while people were still grieving. Despite days later suggesting openness to outlawing the bump stock device that allowed Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock to fire at near-automatic rates, the Trump administration has shown no signs of urgency.  “He has asked that that process be reviewed, and we’re waiting on some of the details of that to take place,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Oct. 27 when asked about bump stocks. “But a decision hasn’t been finalized on that. ”  Trump, who supported gun control before reversing his position to enter the Republican presidential primary, courted the National Rifle Association’s endorsement in 2016, and earlier this year became the first president in three decades to speak at the gun group’s annual convention.  In February, Trump signed legislation reversing an Obama-era regulation that would have made it harder for Americans with mental illnesses to buy a gun.  Under the Obama rule, the Social Security Administration would have been required to send in the names of beneficiaries with mental impairments who needed a third party to manage their financial affairs. The rule would have affected an estimated 75,000 beneficiaries who would have been added to the national background check database.  The attack happened in South Texas on Sunday morning when a man dressed in black tactical-style gear and armed with an assault rifle opened fire inside a Baptist church in a small community, killing 26 people and wounding 20 others in the deadliest mass shooting in state history.  As Kelley left the scene, authorities said, he was confronted by an armed resident. Kelley later was found dead in his vehicle.  Trump said, “Fortunately somebody else had a gun that was shooting in the opposite direction, otherwise it (wouldn’t) have been as bad as it was. It would have been much worse.”  Investigators believe Kelley shot himself.  ___  Associated Press writers Kevin Freking, Catherine Lucey and Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this report.",12.0,7.0
801,2230,10,19,2017,2017-10-19,Fox News,Shares of United Airlines tumble after 3Q financial report,"Shares of United Airlines dropped more than 12 percent on Thursday — their biggest one-day percentage decline in eight years — after a contentious conference call that caused analysts to question whether United executives are making progress on their turnaround plan.  Analysts speculated whether a management shakeup could be coming.  United had already signaled that weak pricing will continue for the rest of this year. On the call, several analysts pressed management for evidence that the company is doing enough to raise revenue and control costs.  CEO Oscar Munoz appealed for patience. He said United ""dug ourselves in a hole"" compared to competitors, and that his management team is working on a plan for long-term success.  ""It's a difficult period for us as we work through all this information,"" Munoz said. ""The team has only been in place really for a year and we're just getting our mojo working ... I just need a little more time.""  Munoz was named CEO in September 2015. He cemented his executive lineup by hiring former American Airlines president Scott Kirby for the same job at United in August 2016.  United executives claimed Thursday that measures they spelled out at an investor day last year to raise revenue and cut spending were going well, but they declined to give specifics or back away from expansion plans.  Barclays analyst Brandon Oglenski was especially pointed in his criticism, telling Munoz that the CEO should know that when a company makes public statements about financial targets, investors will want to measure it against those numbers. He said United's earnings, margins and stock price were doing worse in 2017 than those of key rivals.  Shares of United Continental Holdings Inc. tumbled $8.21, or 12.1 percent, to close at $59.78. It was the biggest one-day drop ever in price, and the biggest percentage decline since October 2009. The shares have dropped 18 percent this year, while shares of American, Delta and Southwest airlines have gained between 6 and 18 percent.  Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi said Thursday's sell-off reflected ""an erosion in confidence of management."" He said the top question he heard from investors was whether this could be ""a catalyst for management change.""  ""Clearly, patience with executing the turnaround at United is wearing thin with investors,"" DeNardi wrote in a note to clients.  Cowen and Co. analyst Helane Becker said there had been ""rumblings"" from investors about another shakeup at United before the call, but afterward ""they aren't rumblings, but full-fledged screams.""  The prickly call came a day after United reported that third-quarter profit fell by one-third to $637 million as hurricanes led to 8,300 canceled flights and $210 million in lost revenue. A key measure of pricing power fell 3.7 percent, and the Chicago-based airline forecast it will drop by 1 percent to 3 percent in the fourth quarter.  Analysts said the fourth-quarter forecast wasn't so bad, but raised doubts about recent business initiatives.  ""People are beginning to wonder, is the strategy working?"" Stephens Inc. analyst Jack Atkins said in an interview. ""When will we see that materialize in the financials?""  United is on pace to increase domestic passenger-carrying capacity by more than 4 percent this year. Atkins said that is too fast and undermines pricing power, and that United is simultaneously seeing a ""really troubling"" increase in costs.  ___  David Koenig can be reached at http://twitter.com/airlinewriter",150.0,218.0
1007,2566,10,26,2017,2017-10-26,The New York Times,C.D.C. Panel Recommends a New Shingles Vaccine," In an unusually close vote, an advisory panel to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday recommended the use of a new vaccine to prevent shingles over an older one that was considered less effective.  The decision was made just days after the Food and Drug Administration announced approval of the new vaccine, called Shingrix and manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline, for adults ages 50 and older. The panel’s recommendation gives preference to the new vaccine over Merck’s Zostavax, which has been the only shingles vaccine on the market for over a decade and was recommended for people ages 60 and older.  The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices also recommended that adults who have received the older vaccine get the new one. Even with the committee vote, this recommendation still awaits formal endorsement by the head of the C.D.C., which usually takes a couple of months. Insurance companies must also agree to cover the cost of the vaccine, which GSK estimates to be $280 for two doses.

The Las Vegas tourism sector is bracing for changes in the aftermath of the massacre that killed 58 people at an outdoor music festival. (AP Photo/John Locher)  LAS VEGAS (AP) — Las Vegas’ tourism sector is bracing for changes in the aftermath of the massacre that killed 58 people at an outdoor music festival.  Analysts who closely track the finances of the city’s casino companies say Las Vegas will see a short-term dip in visitors in response to the shooting.  Casinos and police may have to impose new security measures after gunman Stephen Paddock brought more than 20 rifles into his hotel room and drove a car filled with explosives into the parking garage.  The “What Happens in Vegas Stays in Vegas” slogan has been put on hold, as has one unveiled in the weeks before the shooting by the owner of Mandalay Bay that said, “We are not in the hotel business ... we are in the holy s--- business.”  Electronic billboards that typically promote restaurants, concerts, a topless pool and other entertainment are now showing a dedicated phone line for victims and their families, along with words of appreciation for first responders and casino employees.  “We’ve been there for you during the good times. Thank you for being there for us now,” reads a black-and-white billboard message with the city skyline and ”#VegasStrong.”  It’s hard to quantify the effect the shooting will have on Las Vegas tourism. Airplanes still carry loads of tourists to the desert oasis, convention-goers fill large halls to discuss the latest industry trends, and slot machines ring in the casinos.  But stock prices of the main Las Vegas casino companies all took a minor tumble after the shooting, in an indication the attack will have some effect on the industry. Analysts with investment bank Morgan Stanley forecast the shooting will decrease demand for the Las Vegas market for about six months and have a 4 percent to 6 percent economic effect.  The analysts looked into the effect of terrorist attacks on “revenue per available room,” a key gauge of a lodging company’s performance, across different markets to measure the shooting’s potential impact. The report said not all markets are alike, but the effects on tourism of events such as the Orlando, Florida, nightclub attack have gradually become less pronounced and shorter.  On Oct. 1, Paddock, a 64-year-old professional video poker player, shattered windows of his hotel suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel casino and unleashed withering gunfire at the Route 91 Harvest country music festival below before killing himself. His vehicle was found at the hotel’s massive parking garage with a potentially deadly cargo of 1,600 rounds of ammunition and 90 pounds of chemical explosives.  In the days after the shooting, visitors found marked police SUVs parked outside their hotels along the Strip. Security employees of the Wynn Las Vegas and Encore casino-resorts used hand-held metal detectors to check bags. Guards asked some visitors to pop their trunks.  But those measures have since been scaled back. A tour of several major resorts found no apparent new security measures other than guards checking room keys at Mandalay Bay.  Mandalay Bay’s parent company, MGM Resorts International, owns more than a dozen properties, including casinos, convention space and arenas on the Las Vegas Strip. Spokeswoman Debra DeShong said in a statement the company has elevated its level of security, but she declined to provide details.  Las Vegas hotel operators must make their guests feel valued and comfortable in the aftermath of the shooting, said Michael McCall, Michigan State University professor of hospitality business. He suggested resorts offer room upgrades or discounted tickets to customers as tokens of appreciation.  But he said many casinos and hotels will tread lightly when it comes to airport-style security in a city where people want to let loose.  “You don’t want it to become a sort of ground zero military-type of operation,” McCall said. “People are going there largely for fun.”  MGM declined to comment on any hotel room or convention cancellations. Caesars said its properties haven’t received out-of-norm room cancellations, and no conventions were called off.  Last week, the National Business Aviation Association convention drew around 27,000 people to Las Vegas. IMEX America, an expo for incentive travel, meetings and events, brought 12,000 attendees.  Luis Barros visited Las Vegas for the aviation conference. While sitting at an airport slot machine, he said he never considered canceling his trip after the shooting and had no concerns about his safety.  “I figured this is probably going to be one of the safest places after what just happened,” the Dallas resident said. “I think I’m more concerned about the somber feeling, but as far as security-wise, no, not at all.”  The shooting has altered at least one event. Organizers of the GEICO Rock ‘n’ Roll Marathon scheduled for November will no longer start the annual race outside Mandalay Bay or hold the pre-race concert at the venue where the shooting took place.  Las Vegas last year welcomed 42.9 million visitors and hosted almost 22,000 conventions. On average, 95 percent of the 149,339 rooms available were booked during weekends. Clark County recorded gambling revenue of $9.7 billion.  For the time being, the fierce competition for those dollars is not on display.  “There’s going to be a time when we go back to promoting Las Vegas as the greatest destination in the world, but that’s not now,” said the city’s top tourism official, Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority CEO Rossi Ralenkotter. “We need to take care of this, we need to take care of our customers, we need to take care of the community itself, and that’s what we will be doing.”  ___  For complete coverage of the Las Vegas shooting, click here: https://apnews.com/tag/LasVegasmassshooting.",98.0,89.0

I’ve Got a Few Ideas,"But raising rates for the highest earners would raise issues of fairness, since it would further penalize earned income, while leaving passive income like capital gains untouched. A higher tax bracket for the highest earners would have little impact on Mr. Trump, since he has relatively little earned income, as opposed to pass-through income and capital gains.  Still, to help pay for pro-growth corporate tax cuts, “I would have no problem raising capital-gains rates or creating a new bracket for the rich, or both,” Mr. Holtz-Eakin said.  Tax capital gains at death.  The appreciation of capital assets is already taxed at an extremely favorable rate compared to labor. That’s why the rich pay such a low effective tax rate no matter what their marginal tax bracket. Various justifications for lower capital-gains rates have been proffered over the years, none of them self-evident. But even conceding the wisdom of lower capital-gains rates, why should they never be taxed at all, even as they are passed from generation to generation?  The argument for taxing such gains seems even more compelling given the proposed elimination of the estate tax, which at least captures some capital gains among the wealthiest people.  “To take away the backstop of the estate tax without a tax on capital gains at death is crazy,” Mr. Rosenthal said.  During the campaign, Mr. Trump proposed a plan to tax capital gains in excess of $10 million at death. That would avoid shifting the burden from the very wealthy to the less affluent. Congress could even exempt family-owned farms and small businesses. (There aren’t that many valued at more than $10 million.)  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the exclusion of capital gains at death would cost the Treasury $644 billion from 2014 to 2023. How much of that could be recaptured depends on where the threshold is set (it certainly could be lower or even higher than the $10 million). Let’s assume about half, or $320 billion.",27.0,43.0

A report from Britain’s Companies House shows losses last year at the two resorts more than doubled to 17.6 million pounds ($23 million). Revenue also fell sharply. The company attributed the results partly to having shut down its Turnberry resort for half the year while fixing up a course. (AP Photo/Scott Heppell, File)  NEW YORK (AP) — Donald Trump boasts of making great deals, but a financial report filed with the British government shows he has lost millions of dollars for three years running on a couple of his more recent big investments: his Scottish golf resorts.  A report from Britain’s Companies House released late Friday shows losses last year at the two resorts more than doubled to 17.6 million pounds ($23 million). Revenue also fell sharply.  In the report, Trump’s company attributed the results partly to having shut down its Turnberry resort for half the year while building a new course there and fixing up an old one.  His company has faced several setbacks since it ventured into Scotland a dozen years ago, and its troubles recently have mounted.  The company has angered some local residents near its second resort on the North Sea with what they say are its bullying tactics to make way for more development. The company also has lost a court fight to stop an offshore windmill farm near that resort, drew objections from environmental regulators over building plans there in August and appears at risk of losing a bid to host the coveted Scottish Open at its courses.  Amanda Miller, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, declined to comment about the results.  Trump handed over management of his company to his two adult sons before becoming U.S. president, but still retains his financial interest in it.  It’s not clear how big a role Trump’s setbacks in Scotland have played in the losses. In addition to the Turnberry shutdown, the company also noted in its report that it took an 8 million pound ($10 million) loss due to fluctuations in the value of the British pound last year.  The company reported that revenue at the two courses fell 21 percent to 9 million pounds ($11.7 million) in 2016 from 11.4 million pounds ($15 million) a year earlier.  Trump’s golf business is closely watched because he has made big investments buying and developing courses in recent years, a risky wager in a struggling industry. It is also a bit of departure for the company. Trump has mostly played it safe in other parts of his business, putting his name on buildings owned by others and taking a marketing and management fee instead of investing himself.  Much of the anger toward Trump in Scotland is centered around his resort outside Aberdeen overlooking the North Sea coast and its famed sand dunes stretching into the distance. Called the Trump International Golf Links, it is here that a local fisherman became a national hero of sorts for refusing a $690,000 offer from Trump for his land and where footage was shot for a documentary on Trump’s fights with the residents, called “Tripping Up Trump.”  Many locals praise the course for bringing in more tourists to the area and helping the local economy, but Trump’s critics there are outspoken and now, with their target the U.S. president, playing to a worldwide audience.  The same day that the financial report on the resorts was released, an online petition by a global corporate watchdog group fighting Trump’s plans for a second 18-hole course to the North Sea resort got signature number 94,860.  When Trump visited his North Sea resort in June last year, two local residents ran Mexican flags up a pole in protest against the then-candidate’s immigration policies. It was a snub that came just after the U.K. Supreme Court ruled unanimously against Trump’s efforts to stop the wind farm, a Scottish government decision to strip him of his title as business ambassador for Scotland and the revocation of an honorary degree from Aberdeen’s Robert Gordon University.  Both the Scottish government and the university cited Trump’s comments about Muslims during the campaign.  In July, the CEO of a major sponsor of the Scottish Open was quoted in a local newspaper casting doubt on Trump’s chances of hosting the event.  “There’s no decision made but, look, there are clear issues,” Aberdeen Asset Management CEO Martin Gilbert was quoted saying. He added, “Politics aside, Trump would be an ideal venue — but you can’t put politics aside.”  Asked for clarification on Friday about what Martin meant by “issues” and “politics,” Aberdeen Asset spokesman James Thorneley told the AP: “It’s pretty kind of obvious, right?” Pressed, he said he would not comment further.  This summer, Scotland’s Environmental Protection Agency and the Scottish Natural Heritage, a conservation group, sent letters to the Aberdeenshire Council urging it to reject Trump’s plans for the second course if he did not make certain changes. A vote by the local government, expected in August, was postponed.  The global watchdog group behind the online petition, SumofUs, used the environmental objections in its plea for signatures. It also seized on Trump’s reaction to the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, to muster support, arguing that Trump’s rhetoric has “bolstered white supremacists” across the globe.  Its argument on its website: “Now we have a chance to reject Trump’s hatred and protect our environment in one fell swoop.”  Still, the two courses are widely praised for their beauty, and tourists on buses like to stop by the North Sea course for a round.  Whether any of this will hurt profits at Trump’s Scottish business in the long run is another matter.  In the financial report, Eric Trump, the president’s son and a director of British subsidiary that owns the two resorts, included a letter expressing confidence that the resorts will attract plenty of golfers. He said Turnberry has received “excellent reviews” from its guests, and that the reopening of the resort is ushering in an “exciting new era” for the company.",83.0,113.0
649,2048,10,15,2017,2017-10-15,Fox News,Dem Sen. Murphy: Trump's plan to end ObamaCare subsidies 'health care arson',"President Donald Trump’s abrupt move to cut off federal payments to insurers amounts to “health care arson,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told “Fox News Sunday.”  “He’s really setting the entire health care system on fire because the president is upset that the United States Congress won’t pass a repeal bill that is supported by 17 percent of the American public,” Murphy, a member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, added.  The money goes to companies for lowering out-of-pocket costs like co-payments and deductibles for low- and middle-income customers. It will cost about $7 billion this year and help more than 6 million people.  Ending the payments would affect insurers because ObamaCare requires them to reduce their poorer customers’ costs. Carriers are likely to recoup the lost money by increasing 2018 premiums for people buying their own health insurance policies.  The National Association of Insurance Commissioners estimates that Trump’s move would produce a 12 percent to 15 percent upsurge in premiums, while the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has put the figure at 20 percent. That’s on top of premium increases from growing medical costs.  Trump relished his latest blow against ObamaCare -- which he'd pledged to repeal during his presidential campaign, only to see the effort crash in the GOP-run Senate this summer. He’s long derided the subsidies as bailouts to insurers, even though the payments and the cost reductions for consumers are required by law.  A federal judge has found that Congress never properly approved the payments, Fox News previously reported.  The White House said in a statement that the Department of Health and Human Services has determined there is no appropriation for so-called cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers under the ObamaCare law.  “We will discontinue these payments immediately,” acting HHS Secretary Eric Hargan and Medicare administrator Seema Verma said late Thursday.  “Without the subsidies there will be many people who won’t be able to provide insurance and afford it, and the other set of subsidies that go to individuals will actually increase, meaning the deficit goes up, the amount of money we spend overall on the Affordable Care Act goes up because all that happens is the payments that used to be going to insurance companies now get substitute with increased tax credits for individuals to afford the coverage,” Murphy said.  “The fact of the matter is the president is trying to sabotage the American health care system, trying to put a gun to the head of our constituents by taking away their health care or raising their costs in order to force us to repeal a bill the American public doesn’t want us to repeal,” Murphy said about ObamaCare.

336,1673,10,6,2017,2017-10-06,The New York Times,Trump Administration Formally Lifts Sanctions on Sudan," The Trump administration announced Friday that it would formally lift a host of sanctions against Sudan, concluding that decades of punitive efforts had done little to encourage reforms or fully resolve a conflict in the Darfur region that once inspired protests.  The rapprochement is among the few policies of its predecessors that the Trump administration has been eager to continue. The State Department announced a new strategy for Sudan in the last days of the Obama administration that included lifting sanctions, ending 20 years of hostile relations.  The reconciliation was set back briefly when the White House initially included Sudan this year among the list of countries subject to a travel ban. But last month the Trump administration removed Sudan from the list, the only country named in the initial ban to no longer face any restrictions.  In a briefing with reporters, State Department officials emphasized that while the Sudanese government was still far from perfect, there were enough signs of progress on several fronts to move forward. Those issues included the end of Khartoum’s attacks on civilians in Darfur and other areas, curbing its destabilizing activities in neighboring South Sudan and increasing its cooperation with the United States on counterterrorism issues.",3.0,7.0

Hurricane Ophelia, now a post-tropical cyclone, is adding to an especially brutal few months for climate and weather-related disasters around the world.  In the United States, four major hurricanes — Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate — battered the East Coast. Meanwhile, wildfires have torched large swaths of forest and shrub land in the West. In Europe, storms and wildfires are now cheek and jowl, with the former feeding into one of Europe’s worst fire seasons.

Strong winds from the storm quickly spread flames that ignited over the weekend along the Iberian coast.  These fires join dozens of other blazes across the Mediterranean region, adding to an already devastating fire season in Europe fueled by a hot, dry summer. Wildfires earlier this summer killed 62 people in Portugal.

As with the ongoing wildfires in California, human activity ranging from forest management practices to deliberate ignition are exacerbating the damage from infernos in Europe.  Scientists have also found that climate change is increasing the risk of hurricane and wildfire damage in Europe. In a 2013 paper published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, Dutch scientists reported that rising sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic are extending the breeding ground for hurricanes farther east.  “Our model simulations clearly show that future tropical cyclones are more prone to hit Western Europe, and do so earlier in the season, thereby increasing the frequency and impact of hurricane force winds,” the team wrote.  Meanwhile, the European Environment Agency projected a rise in the “length and severity of the fire season, the area at risk and the probability of large fires,” as average temperature rises this century.

(AP Photo/Kathy Willens, File)  NEW YORK (AP) — Inmate No. 87850-053 has no internet.  That could be the least of the inconveniences ahead for “Pharma Bro” Martin Shkreli, whose online rantings about Hillary Clinton prompted a judge this week to revoke his bail and put him in the Metropolitan Detention Center, a fortress-like federal jail that also houses terrorism and mob suspects.  MDC, as the Brooklyn lockup for 1,800 men and women is known, has over the years drawn complaints ranging from sexual assaults to the lack of fresh air, sunlight and recreation.  Federal prison officials wouldn’t discuss Shkreli’s conditions, though his lawyer says his client is in with the general population. All defense attorney Ben Brafman would say of Shkreli’s two nights locked up so far is that he “is doing reasonably well under very difficult circumstances.”  Shkreli, a boyish pharma executive best known for jacking up the price of a life-saving drug, had been allowed to remain free on $5 million bail following his conviction last month in an unrelated securities fraud scheme involving two hedge funds he ran.  But Shkreli’s creepy Facebook posting offering a $5,000 bounty for a strand of Clinton’s hair was the last straw for U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto, who agreed with prosecutors that he should be put behind bars until his sentencing for securities fraud early next year.  He is facing up to 20 years in prison on the most serious charges. But he had brashly predicted in livestreamed rants that he would never see the inside of a prison because of sentencing guidelines — and that even if he did get prison time, it would be just a few months at a minimum-security “Club Fed.”  “I’ll play basketball and tennis and Xbox and be out on these streets in four months,” he boasted to the New York Daily News just minutes after his conviction.  That’s hardly what Shkreli will be experiencing at MDC, where he will remain for at least four months until his Jan. 16 sentencing.  The 34-year-old Shkreli is under the same roof as defendants accused of plotting to join the Islamic State group or commit attacks on its behalf. Others include organized crime family captain Vincent Asaro and Edgar Veytia, a former Mexican state attorney general charged with drug smuggling.  While far less notorious than city-run Rikers Island, the Brooklyn facility has a checkered history. After the Sept. 11 attacks, dozens of mostly Arab or Muslim men “of high interest” were detained at MDC, where many claimed guards regularly slammed them against walls until officials began videotaping them as a safeguard.  More recently, prosecutors have alleged that MDC was the scene of sexual assaults by guards on female inmates. A federal magistrate last year expressed reluctance to remand a woman there, citing a report saying there was an “absence of fresh, clean air, the complete absence of sunlight, and the absence of ANY outdoor time and activities.”  In a court filing, lawyers for Jacob “Kobi” Alexander, the convicted ex-CEO of Converse Technology, complained about a lack of recreation time, saying he “spends large parts of his day walking in circles in his unit when he is permitted to do so.”  When the technology website Gizmodo recently pressed Shkreli on a then-hypothetical question of what he would read if locked up, he played along.  “I don’t read much fiction,” he said, “but I would probably bone up on philosophy.”",4.0,7.0

(AP Photo/Lee Jin-man)  SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Hundreds of South Koreans took to the streets of Seoul on Tuesday for two separate demonstrations, one to show support for visiting President Donald Trump and the other to voice disapproval of the U.S. leader amid concerns over North Korea’s nuclear threats.  Surrounded by thousands of police officers and a tight perimeter created by buses, hundreds of anti-Trump protesters rallied at a boulevard near the U.S. Embassy, holding banners that read “No Trump” and “No War.”  The demonstrators accused the outspoken president of raising tensions with North Korea and pressuring Seoul to buy more U.S. weapons. They also criticized him for pressing Seoul to re-do a bilateral free trade deal between the countries so that it’s more favorable to the United States.  Across the street, hundreds of Trump supporters waved the U.S. and South Korean flags and held signs that read “Blood Allies Korea + US.” They chanted “USA!” when Trump’s motorcade passed by the two protest groups for a meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in at the presidential Blue House.  More than 15,000 officers will be deployed to provide security during Trump’s two-day visit and monitor the demonstrations, according to the National Police Agency.  Anti-Trump protesters scuffled with South Korean police on Tuesday while trying to hold a rally against President Donald Trump's visit to Seoul. The demonstrators called for Trump to apologize for his rhetoric against North Korea. (Nov. 7)  Police had unsuccessfully attempted to block anti-Trump protesters from marching in streets near the presidential palace, with the Seoul Administrative Court ruling that such a ban would infringe on the protesters’ freedom of assembly. Dozens of anti-Trump protesters rallied near the presidential office earlier on Tuesday under the close watch of police.  “We oppose the visit to South Korea by Trump, who has heightened the fears of war on the Korean Peninsula,” said one of the protesters, reading from a statement.  The group, which calls itself the “No Trump Coalition,” also plans to protest on Wednesday near Seoul’s parliament, where Trump is to make a speech calling on the international community to maximize pressure on North Korea.  Pro- and anti-Trump protesters have been staging dueling but peaceful protests in Seoul in recent weeks ahead of Trump’s visit, reflecting a public deeply divided along ideological and generational lines.  Many South Koreans are concerned that Trump’s fiery rhetoric on North Korea, which has included threats of military options, is raising the risk of an unwanted war on the Korean Peninsula that could cost thousands of South Korean lives.  Others, including older people who tend to be more conservative, are supportive of Trump’s tough stance against the North, which has been accelerating its nuclear weapons and missile tests in recent months, and accuse liberal South Korean President Moon of being too soft on Pyongyang.  South Korea is known for its vibrant, and occasionally violent, protest culture that sometimes results in significant political changes. Massive but peaceful street protests by millions drove lawmakers to impeach then-President Park Geun-hye over a corruption scandal in December. Park was formally removed from office and arrested in March over charges including bribery and extortion.  The conservative Korea Freedom Federation released a statement welcoming Trump’s visit, which it described as a “God-like move” that would “instantly reverse” the security situation on the peninsula after the allies had been forced to the “defensive” by North Korea’s weapons tests. However, the group also lamented Trump’s decision not to visit the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between the Koreas during his visit to the South, saying that it might lead North Korea to misjudge that its provocations have hurt the allies’ morale.  Meanwhile, in the Philippines, dozens of protesters burned a portrait of Trump in downtown Manila on Tuesday, saying the president, who will join a summit of East Asian leaders next week in the country, is not welcome there.

Congress could then decide to restore sanctions, do nothing or make changes to the law. Trump is pressing Congress to work to fix the deal's ""flaws.""  IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL: WHAT IS IT?  In making his decision, Trump said, “Iran is not living up to the spirit of the deal.” Among other alleged violations, Trump said Iran failed to meet expectations in its operation of advanced centrifuges and intimidated international inspectors into not using their full authority.  The president also slammed sunset provisions in the deal itself, complaining that the U.S. got a “weak inspection” in exchange for a “short-term” delay in Iran’s nuclear progress.  Trump, meanwhile, announced plans to take action against the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, authorizing the Treasury Department to impose targeted sanctions against “its officials, agents, and affiliates.”  “Execution of our strategy begins with a long overdue step of imposing tough sanctions on Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps,” Trump said. “The revolutionary guard is the Iranian supreme leader’s corrupt personal terror force and militia.”  In his broadside against the Iranian regime, the president said it “remains the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism,” accusing it of providing assistance to Al Qaeda, the Taliban, Hezbollah and other terrorist networks.  The president accused Iran of developing missiles that threaten American troops and allies and imprisoning Americans “on false charges.”  “Given the regime's murderous past and present, we should not take lightly its sinister vision for the future,” Trump said. “The regimes two favorite chants are ‘Death to America’ and ‘Death to Israel.’”  The president did not designate the IRGC a terrorist group, something that had been rumored ahead of the announcement. In the run-up to the decision, Iranian officials threatened consequences if that occurred.  “If the news is correct about the stupidity of the American government in considering the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group, then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world,” IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said Sunday, according to Reuters.  The National Resistance Council of Iran, an offshoot organization of the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (MEK), praised Trump's move in support of the de-certification.  Mrs. Maryam Rajavi, President-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), welcomed the new U.S. policy to ""condemn the IRGC's gross violations of human rights"" in Iran.  ""The regime's deadly meddling in the region and concessions made to it in the course of the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) have been disastrous, and for which the people of Iran and the region have paid heavily,"" Rajavi said in a statement provided to Fox News.  ""The IRGC is a prime means of suppression, execution, and torture in Iran, spreading terrorism throughout the world, war mongering and massacre in the region, the drive for acquiring nuclear weapons, and the increase in the proliferation of ballistic missiles,"" she said. ""If the IRGC had been recognized as a terrorist entity earlier and dealt with accordingly, the current situation in the region in general, and Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, and Afghanistan in particular, would have been totally different.""  Trump had been facing a Sunday deadline to notify Congress whether Iran is complying with the accord.  Republicans are calling for new legislation that addresses the “flaws” of the agreement.  “Lawmakers need to do now what we couldn’t do two years ago: unite around an Iran strategy that truly stops Iran’s nuclear weapons program and empowers the United States and our allies to combat the full spectrum of Iran’s imperial aggression,” Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said in a statement.  Democrats accused the president of making matters worse. Former Obama administration official Ben Rhodes, who helped sell the Iran deal, said the president is “provoking” a crisis with his speech.  “Hard to overstate how irresponsible it is for Trump to risk blowing up Iran Deal by demanding rest of world justify his campaign rhetoric,” Rhodes tweeted.  Fox News’ Serafin Gomez, Mike Emanuel and Perry Chiaramonte and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",1.0,7.0
304,1638,10,5,2017,2017-10-05,The New York Times,Why Some Scars From the Recession May Never Vanish,"Other factors that could be keeping people out of the job market are also being examined. In a widely discussed paper earlier this year, for example, economists at the University of Chicago and other schools argued that some young men are opting out of the labor force to play video games. (Other economists are skeptical.) Some research has pointed a finger at the federal disability system: Nearly two million more Americans are receiving federal disability payments than when the recession began in 2007, an increase that some economists argue is a reflection of the benefits’ use as an alternative to work. Some research, however, has concluded that the increase in disability claimants is due mostly to an aging population and is, in any case, a small piece of the overall decline in employment.  Deeper changes in the structure of the American economy could also be playing a part. A variety of evidence, including declining rates of entrepreneurship and falling job turnover, suggests the nation’s economy has become less dynamic and flexible since 2000, which could have made it harder for workers and companies alike to adapt following the shock of a recession.  And the recession may have accelerated trends that were already underway: Research from Lisa B. Kahn, a Yale economist, and a co-author has found that companies had, in effect, taken advantage of the recession to replace workers with machines. That was particularly damaging for men without a college degree — a group that was already struggling before the recession and that has been especially slow to recover from it.  “We were on a kind of trend where that group of people was going to find it harder and harder to find productive outlets in the labor market, and the recession kind of accelerated that,” Ms. Kahn said. Had the change happened more gradually, Ms. Kahn added, workers might have had a chance to adapt and learn new skills; instead, the recession left millions of them jobless in an environment where there was little demand for their labor.  Work like that of Ms. Kahn and Mr. Krueger suggests that what begins as a cyclical recession-driven problem can harden into a permanent structural issue. That could carry a lesson for policy makers: If the United States no longer recovers as quickly from recessions as it once did, and if those slow recoveries can leave permanent scars on workers, then it is all the more important to kick-start the economy before too much damage is done.  Ben S. Bernanke, then the chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned during the recession and the recovery that workers who stayed unemployed too long might drift too far away from the labor market to return. Mr. Yagan’s research suggests that efforts by the Fed, Congress and the Obama administration to prevent that had not gone far enough.  Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. who is now with the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said Mr. Yagan’s research could be read as an indictment of economic policy after the recession. If Congress and the administration had been willing to act more aggressively, they might have avoided some of the long-lasting damage that has been done.",29.0,43.0
1591,3296,11,10,2017,2017-11-10,The New York Times,What’s at Stake in the Bonn Climate Talks?,"In 2018, leaders plan to assess their efforts to date and discuss what further action could help lessen the odds of drastic global warming — with the goal of crafting newer, stronger national pledges by 2020. But before they can do any of that, they need to agree to formal ground rules for that exercise. That “rule book” will be a focus at Bonn.  How do countries plan to make progress on climate change?  One widely recognized problem with the current Paris pledges is that they’re fairly vague.  China promised that its emissions would peak around 2030, but the country’s energy data is notoriously murky, so it’s hard to tell how much progress it’s actually making. Similarly, the European Union vowed to cut emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, but offered few specifics on how to achieve that goal — making it hard to gauge whether European policymakers could realistically be doing much more.  At Bonn, negotiators will be discussing how to make these pledges more rigorous and transparent, so that countries can more readily be held accountable for their actions. That means tackling questions like: What’s the best way to track nations’ progress, to see if they’re doing what they said they would do? Is there a way to tell if a country’s pledge could be made more ambitious? Which specific policies are working well and which aren’t?  Because the Paris pledges are largely voluntary — world leaders would have never agreed to a deal otherwise — no one can force governments to take additional action. But, the idea goes, if pledges and policies are made more transparent, world leaders will be better able to pressure and help each other to do more.  The final draft of this “rule book” is not due until next year, and it may not actually get finished at Bonn, but negotiators are hoping to make significant progress on a long list of items at these talks. As always, diplomacy tends to proceed fitfully.  What role will the U.S. play?  Even though the Trump administration has vowed to withdraw from the Paris agreement, the United States can’t formally exit the climate talks until 2020. So the State Department is sending a small team of negotiators to discuss some of the details of the pact.",2.0,1.0

One such recipient is none other than the Open Society Foundation, chaired by billionaire George Soros.  2ndVote has found the NFLPA provides financial support to Soros’ Center for Community Change Action, the social justice arm of the organization, which, according to the Washington Free Beacon, “has been involved in direct action against President Donald Trump and Republicans before and after the November elections.”  Trending: AMERICA’S BIGGEST LOSER Explains Why Multiple Sexual Assault Claims Against Bill Clinton Are Not As Serious As Kavanaugh’s…Calls For CIVIL WAR! [VIDEO]  The NFLPA has been donating to several far-left and anti-trump causes dating back to at least 2013.    Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court? Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?  Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court? * Yes, he will be confirmed. No, he will not be confirmed.  Email *  Name      Soros has a long history of funding some of the most radical and far-left causes in the United States.  He is known to have supported the Occupy Wall Street protests of 2012, the National Resource Defense Council, an Anti-Trump environmental organization, pro-abortion movements including Planned Parenthood, as well as numerous anti-Trump “resistance” causes.  Soros has also funded at least 56 of the “Key Partners” from the Women’s March on Washington, which occurred the day after Trump’s inauguration.  Despite being touted by the media as “a huge, spontaneous groundswell” and a “grassroots, independent uprising” of women, it turns out to be just another well funded and organized operation by the Soros empire.  A RECENT REPORT ON SOROS FUNDING OF LEFTIST CAUSES:  WOW! AMERICA IS UNDER ATTACK By These 187 Organizations Directly Funded By George Soros  Some of the names on this list will shock you…Abortion groups, open borders, immigrant groups, groups to change the way we vote, universal health care, climate change, “Catholics”, Socialists and Communists. Soros actually has a group whose stated goal is to take money from rich Jews and give it to those with less. Considering a video just surfaced yesterday showing George Soros (a Jew) admitting that he helped confiscate property from Jews during WWII, the idea that Soros is funding such a group is not really so stunning.  They’re all here. 187 groups being used to destroy America, thanks to funding by billionaire George Soros. Here are the groups who are using Trump’s election as an excuse to take down America:  There have been many articles written about George Soros and his collectivist activism. Soros is a business magnate, investor, philanthropist, and author who is of Jewish-Hungarian ancestry and holds dual citizenship. He is chairman of Soros Fund Management. Discover the Networks has published a comprehensive list of organizations funded by Soros and his Open Society Institute.  Some of these groups have actively opposed Donald Trump for president and may be part of the recent levels of violence and chaos seen at his rallies. Many of the groups favor: open borders, amnesty, giving illegals voting rights, Muslim migration and social justice.  Organizations that, in recent years, have received direct funding and assistance from George Soros and his Open Society Institute (OSI) include the following. (Comprehensive profiles of each are available in the “Groups” section of DiscoverTheNetworks.org):  Advancement Project: This organization works to organize “communities of color” into politically cohesive units while disseminating its leftist worldviews and values as broadly as possible by way of a sophisticated communications department.  Air America Radio: Now defunct, this was a self-identified “liberal” radio network.  All of Us or None: This organization seeks to change voting laws — which vary from state to state — so as to allow ex-inmates, parolees, and even current inmates to cast their ballots in political elections.  Alliance for Justice: Best known for its activism vis a vis the appointment of federal judges, this group consistently depicts Republican judicial nominees as “extremists.”  America Coming Together: Soros played a major role in creating this group, whose purpose was to coordinate and organize pro-Democrat voter-mobilization programs.  America Votes: Soros also played a major role in creating this group, whose get-out-the-vote campaigns targeted likely Democratic voters.  America’s Voice: This open-borders group seeks to promote “comprehensive” immigration reform that includes a robust agenda in favor of amnesty for illegal aliens.  American Bar Association Commission on Immigration Policy: This organization “opposes laws that require employers and persons providing education, health care, or other social services to verify citizenship or immigration status.”  American Bridge 21st Century: This Super PAC conducts opposition research designed to help Democratic political candidates defeat their Republican foes.  American Civil Liberties Union: This group opposes virtually all post-9/11 national security measures enacted by the U.S. government. It supports open borders, has rushed to the defense of suspected terrorists and their abettors, and appointed former New Left terrorist Bernardine Dohrn to its Advisory Board.  American Constitution Society for Law and Policy: This Washington, DC-based think tank seeks to move American jurisprudence to the left by recruiting, indoctrinating, and mobilizing young law students, helping them acquire positions of power. It also provides leftist Democrats with a bully pulpit from which to denounce their political adversaries.  American Family Voices: This group creates and coordinates media campaigns charging Republicans with wrongdoing.  American Federation of Teachers: After longtime AFT President Albert Shanker died in in 1997, he was succeeded by Sandra Feldman, who slowly “re-branded” the union, allying it with some of the most powerful left-wing elements of the New Labor Movement. When Feldman died in 2004, Edward McElroy took her place, followed by Randi Weingarten in 2008. All of them kept the union on the leftward course it had adopted in its post-Shanker period.  American Friends Service Committee: This group views the United States as the principal cause of human suffering around the world. As such, it favors America’s unilateral disarmament, the dissolution of American borders, amnesty for illegal aliens, the abolition of the death penalty, and the repeal of the Patriot Act.  American Immigration Council: This non-profit organization is a prominent member of the open-borders lobby. It advocates expanded rights and amnesty for illegal aliens residing in the U.S.  American Immigration Law Foundation: This group supports amnesty for illegal aliens, on whose behalf it litigates against the U.S. government.  American Independent News Network: This organization promotes “impact journalism” that advocates progressive change.  American Institute for Social Justice: AISJ’s goal is to produce skilled community organizers who can “transform poor communities” by agitating for increased government spending on city services, drug interdiction, crime prevention, housing, public-sector jobs, access to healthcare, and public schools.  American Library Association: This group has been an outspoken critic of the Bush administration’s War on Terror — most particularly, Section 215 of the USA Patriot Act, which it calls “a present danger to the constitutional rights and privacy rights of library users.”  The American Prospect, Inc.: This corporation trains and mentors young leftwing journalists, and organizes strategy meetings for leftist leaders.  Amnesty International: This organization directs a grossly disproportionate share of its criticism for human rights violations at the United States and Israel.  Applied Research Center: Viewing the United States as a nation where “structural racism” is deeply “embedded in the fabric of society,” ARC seeks to “build a fair and equal society” by demanding “concrete change from our most powerful institutions.”  Arab American Institute Foundation: The Arab American Institute denounces the purportedly widespread civil liberties violations directed against Arab Americans in the post-9/11 period, and characterizes Israel as a brutal oppressor of the Palestinian people.  Aspen Institute: This organization promotes radical environmentalism and views America as a nation plagued by deep-seated “structural racism.”  Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now: This group conducts voter mobilization drives on behalf of leftist Democrats. These initiatives have been notoriously marred by fraud and corruption.  Ballot Initiative Strategy Center: This organization seeks to advance “a national progressive strategy” by means of ballot measures—state-level legislative proposals that pass successfully through a petition (“initiative”) process and are then voted upon by the public.  Bill of Rights Defense Committee: This group provides a detailed blueprint for activists interested in getting their local towns, cities, and even college campuses to publicly declare their opposition to the Patriot Act, and to designate themselves “Civil Liberties Safe Zones.” The organization also came to the defense of self-described radical attorney Lynne Stewart, who was convicted in 2005 of providing material support for terrorism.  Black Alliance for Just Immigration: This organization seeks to create a unified movement for “social and economic justice” centered on black racial identity.  Blueprint North Carolina: This group seeks to “influence state policy in North Carolina so that residents of the state benefit from more progressive policies such as better access to health care, higher wages, more affordable housing, a safer, cleaner environment, and access to reproductive health services.”  Brennan Center for Justice: This think tank/legal activist group generates scholarly studies, mounts media campaigns, files amicus briefs, gives pro bono support to activists, and litigates test cases in pursuit of radical “change.”  Brookings Institution: This organization has been involved with a variety of internationalist and state-sponsored programs, including one that aspires to facilitate the establishment of a U.N.-dominated world government. Brookings Fellows have also called for additional global collaboration on trade and banking; the expansion of the Kyoto Protocol; and nationalized health insurance for children. Nine Brookings economists signed a petition opposing President Bush’s tax cuts in 2003.  Campaign for America’s Future: This group supports tax hikes, socialized medicine, and a dramatic expansion of social welfare programs.  Campaign for Better Health Care: This organization favors a single-payer, government-run, universal health care system.  Campaign for Youth Justice: This organization contends that “transferring juveniles to the adult criminal-justice system leads to higher rates of recidivism, puts incarcerated and detained youth at unnecessary risk, has little deterrence value, and does not increase public safety.”  Campus Progress: A project of the Soros-bankrolled Center for American Progress, this group seeks to “strengthen progressive voices on college and university campuses, counter the growing influence of right-wing groups on campus, and empower new generations of progressive leaders.”  Casa de Maryland: This organization aggressively lobbies legislators to vote in favor of policies that promote expanded rights, including amnesty, for illegal aliens currently residing in the United States.  Catalist: This is a for-profit political consultancy that seeks “to help progressive organizations realize measurable increases in civic participation and electoral success by building and operating a robust national voter database of every voting-age American.”  Catholics for Choice: This nominally Catholic organization supports women’s right to abortion-on-demand.  Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good: This political nonprofit group is dedicated to generating support from the Catholic community for leftwing candidates, causes, and legislation.  Center for American Progress: This leftist think tank is headed by former Clinton chief of staff John Podesta, works closely with Hillary Clinton, and employs numerous former Clinton administration staffers. It is committed to “developing a long-term vision of a progressive America” and “providing a forum to generate new progressive ideas and policy proposals.”  Center for Community Change: This group recruits and trains activists to spearhead leftist “political issue campaigns.” Promoting increased funding for social welfare programs by bringing “attention to major national issues related to poverty,” the Center bases its training programs on the techniques taught by the famed radical organizer Saul Alinsky.  Center for Constitutional Rights: This pro-Castro organization is a core member of the open borders lobby, has opposed virtually all post-9/11 anti-terrorism measures by the U.S. government, and alleges that American injustice provokes acts of international terrorism.  Center for Economic and Policy Research: This group opposed welfare reform, supports “living wage” laws, rejects tax cuts, and consistently lauds the professed achievements of socialist regimes, most notably Venezuela.  Center for Reproductive Rights: CRR’s mission is to guarantee safe, affordable contraception and abortion-on-demand for all women, including adolescents. The organization has filed state and federal lawsuits demanding access to taxpayer-funded abortions (through Medicaid) for low-income women.  Center for Responsible Lending: This organization was a major player in the subprime mortgage crisis. According to Phil Kerpen (vice president for policy at Americans for Prosperity), CRL “sh[ook] down and harass[ed] banks into making bad loans to unqualified borrowers.” Moreover, CRL negotiated a contract enabling it to operate as a conduit of high-risk loans to Fannie Mae.  Center on Budget and Policy Priorities: Reasoning from the premise that tax cuts generally help only the wealthy, this organization advocates greater tax expenditures on social welfare programs for low earners.  Center on Wisconsin Strategy (COWS): Aiming to redistribute wealth by way of higher taxes imposed on those whose incomes are above average, COWS contends that “it is important that state government be able to harness fair contribution from all parts of society – including corporations and the wealthy.”  Change America Now: Formed in December 2006, Change America Now describes itself as “an independent political organization created to educate citizens on the failed policies of the Republican Congress and to contrast that record of failure with the promise offered by a Democratic agenda.”  Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington: This group litigates and brings ethics charges against “government officials who sacrifice the common good to special interests” and “betray the public trust.” Almost all of its targets are Republicans.  Coalition for an International Criminal Court: This group seeks to subordinate American criminal-justice procedures to those of an international court.  Common Cause: This organization aims to bring about campaign-finance reform, pursue media reform resembling the Fairness Doctrine, and cut military budgets in favor of increased social-welfare and environmental spending.  Constitution Project: This organization seeks to challenge the legality of military commissions; end the detainment of “enemy combatants”; condemn government surveillance of terrorists; and limit the President’s executive privileges.  Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund: Defenders of Wildlife opposes oil exploration in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. It condemns logging, ranching, mining, and even the use of recreational motorized vehicles as activities that are destructive to the environment.  Democracy Alliance: This self-described “liberal organization” aims to raise $200 million to develop a funding clearinghouse for leftist groups. Soros is a major donor to this group.  Democracy 21: This group is a staunch supporter of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, also known as the McCain-Feingold Act.  Democracy Now!: Democracy Now! was created in 1996 by WBAI radio news director Amy Goodman and four partners to provide “perspectives rarely heard in the U.S. corporate-sponsored media,” i.e., the views of radical and foreign journalists, left and labor activists, and ideological foes of capitalism.  Democratic Justice Fund: DJF opposes the Patriot Act and most efforts to restrict or regulate immigration into the United States — particularly from countries designated by the State Department as “terrorist nations.”  Democratic Party: Soros’ funding activities are devoted largely to helping the Democratic Party solidify its power base. In a November 2003 interview, Soros stated that defeating President Bush in 2004 “is the central focus of my life” … “a matter of life and death.” He pledged to raise $75 million to defeat Bush, and personally donated nearly a third of that amount to anti-Bush organizations. “America under Bush,” he said, “is a danger to the world, and I’m willing to put my money where my mouth is.”  Demos: This organization lobbies federal and state policymakers to “addres[s] the economic insecurity and inequality that characterize American society today”; promotes “ideas for reducing gaps in wealth, income and political influence”; and favors tax hikes for the wealthy.  Drum Major Institute: This group describes itself as “a non-partisan, non-profit think tank generating the ideas that fuel the progressive movement,” with the ultimate aim of persuading “policymakers and opinion-leaders” to take steps that advance its vision of “social and economic justice.”  Earthjustice: This group seeks to place severe restrictions on how U.S. land and waterways may be used. It opposes most mining and logging initiatives, commercial fishing businesses, and the use of motorized vehicles in undeveloped areas.  Economic Policy Institute: This organization believes that “government must play an active role in protecting the economically vulnerable, ensuring equal opportunity, and improving the well-being of all Americans.”  Electronic Privacy Information Center: This organization has been a harsh critic of the USA PATRIOT Act and has joined the American Civil Liberties Union in litigating two cases calling for the FBI “to publicly release or account for thousands of pages of information about the government’s use of PATRIOT Act powers.”  Ella Baker Center for Human Rights: Co-founded by the revolutionary communist Van Jones, this anti-poverty organization claims that “decades of disinvestment in our cities” — compounded by “excessive, racist policing and over-incarceration” — have “led to despair and homelessness.”  EMILY’s List: This political network raises money for Democratic female political candidates who support unrestricted access to taxpayer-funded abortion-on-demand.  Energy Action Coalition: Founded in 2004, this group describes itself as “a coalition of 50 youth-led environmental and social justice groups working together to build the youth clean energy and climate movement.” For EAC, this means “dismantling oppression” according to its principles of environmental justice.  Equal Justice USA: This group claims that America’s criminal-justice system is plagued by “significant race and class biases,” and thus seeks to promote major reforms.  Fair Immigration Reform Movement: This is the open-borders arm of the Center for Community Change.  Faithful America: This organization promotes the redistribution of wealth, an end to enhanced interrogation procedures vis a vis prisoners-of-war, the enactment of policies to combat global warming, and the creation of a government-run heath care system.  Feminist Majority: Characterizing the United States as an inherently sexist nation, this group focuses on “advancing the legal, social and political equality of women with men, countering the backlash to women’s advancement, and recruiting and training young feminists to encourage future leadership for the feminist movement in the United States.”  Four Freedoms Fund: This organization was designed to serve as a conduit through which large foundations could fund state-based open-borders organizations more flexibly and quickly.  Free Exchange on Campus: This organization was created solely to oppose the efforts of one individual, David Horowitz, and his campaign to have universities adopt an “Academic Bill of Rights,” as well as to denounce Horowitz’s 2006 book The Professors. Member organizations of FEC include Campus Progress (a project of the Center for American Progress); the American Association of University Professors; the American Civil Liberties Union; People For the American Way; the United States Student Association; the Center for Campus Free Speech; the American Library Association; Free Press; and the National Association of State Public Interest Research Groups.  Free Press: This “media reform” organization has worked closely with many notable leftists and such organizations as Media Matters for America, Air America Radio, Global Exchange, Code Pink, Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, the Revolutionary Communist Party, Mother Jones magazine, and Pacifica Radio.  Funding Exchange: Dedicated to the concept of philanthropy as a vehicle for social change, this organization pairs leftist donors and foundations with like minded groups and activists who are dedicated to bringing about their own version of “progressive” change and social justice. Many of these grantees assume that American society is rife with racism, discrimination, exploitation, and inequity and needs to be overhauled via sustained education, activism, and social agitation.  Gamaliel Foundation: Modeling its tactics on those of the radical Sixties activist Saul Alinsky, this group takes a strong stand against current homeland security measures and immigration restrictions.  Gisha: Center for the Legal Protection of Freedom of Movement: This anti-Israel organization seeks to help Palestinians “exercise their right to freedom of movement.”  Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect: This group contends that when a state proves either unable or unwilling to protect civilians from mass atrocities occurring within its borders, it is the responsibility of the international community to intervene — peacefully if possible, but with military force if necessary.  Global Exchange: Established in 1988 by pro-Castro radical Medea Benjamin, this group consistently condemns America’s foreign policy, business practices, and domestic life. Following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Global Exchange advised Americans to examine “the root causes of resentment against the United States in the Arab world — from our dependence on Middle Eastern oil to our biased policy towards Israel.”  Grantmakers Without Borders: GWB tends to be very supportive of leftist environmental, anti-war, and civil rights groups. It is also generally hostile to capitalism, which it deems one of the chief “political, economic, and social systems” that give rise to a host of “social ills.”  Green For All: This group was created by Van Jones to lobby for federal climate, energy, and economic policy initiatives.  Health Care for America Now: This group supports a “single payer” model where the federal government would be in charge of financing and administering the entire U.S. healthcare system.  Human Rights Campaign: The largest “lesbian-gay-bisexual-transgender” lobbying group in the United States, HRC supports political candidates and legislation that will advance the LGBT agenda. Historically, HRC has most vigorously championed HIV/AIDS-related legislation, “hate crime” laws, the abrogation of the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy, and the legalization of gay marriage.  Human Rights First: This group supports open borders and the rights of illegal aliens; charges that the Patriot Act severely erodes Americans’ civil liberties; has filed amicus curiae briefs on behalf of terror suspect Jose Padilla; and deplores the Guantanamo Bay detention facilities.  Human Rights Watch: This group directs a disproportionate share of its criticism at the United States and Israel. It opposes the death penalty in all cases, and supports open borders and amnesty for illegal aliens.  I’lam: This anti-Israel NGO seeks “to develop and empower the Arab media and to give voice to Palestinian issues.”  Immigrant Defense Project: To advance the cause of illegal immigrants, the IDP provides immigration law backup support and counseling to New York defense attorneys and others who represent or assist immigrants in criminal justice and immigration systems, as well as to immigrants themselves.  Immigrant Legal Resource Center: This group claims to have helped gain amnesty for some three million illegal aliens in the U.S., and in the 1980s was part of the sanctuary movement which sought to grant asylum to refugees from the failed Communist states of Central America.  Immigrant Workers Citizenship Project: This open-borders organization advocates mass immigration to the U.S.  Immigration Advocates Network: This alliance of immigrant-rights groups seeks to “increase access to justice for low-income immigrants and strengthen the capacity of organizations serving them.”  Immigration Policy Center: IPC is an advocate of open borders and contends that the massive influx of illegal immigrants into America is due to U.S. government policy, since “the broken immigration system […] spurs unauthorized immigration in the first place.”  Independent Media Center: This Internet-based, news and events bulletin board represents an invariably leftist, anti-capitalist perspective and serves as a mouthpiece for anti-globalization/anti-America themes.  Independent Media Institute: IMI administers the SPIN Project (Strategic Press Information Network), which provides leftist organizations with “accessible and affordable strategic communications consulting, training, coaching, networking opportunities and concrete tools” to help them “achieve their social justice goals.”  Institute for America’s Future: IAF supports socialized medicine, increased government funding for education, and the creation of an infrastructure “to ensure that the voice of the progressive majority is heard.”  Institute for New Economic Thinking: Seeking to create a new worldwide “economic paradigm,” this organization is staffed by numerous individuals who favor government intervention in national economies, and who view capitalism as a flawed system.  Institute for Policy Studies: This think tank has long supported Communist and anti-American causes around the world. Viewing capitalism as a breeding ground for “unrestrained greed,” IPS seeks to provide a corrective to “unrestrained markets and individualism.” Professing an unquestioning faith in the righteousness of the United Nations, it aims to bring American foreign policy under UN control.  Institute for Public Accuracy: This anti-American, anti-capitalist, anti-Israel organization sponsored actor Sean Penn’s celebrated visit to Baghdad in 2002. It also sponsored visits to Iraq by Democratic Congressmen Nick Rahall and former Democrat Senator James Abourezk  Institute for Women’s Policy Research: This group views the U.S. as a nation rife with discrimination against women, and publishes research to draw attention to this alleged state of affairs. It also advocates unrestricted access to taxpayer-funded abortion-on-demand, stating that “access to abortion is essential to the economic well-being of women and girls.”  International Crisis Group: One of this organization’s leading figures is its Mideast Director, Robert Malley, who was President Bill Clinton’s Special Assistant for Arab-Israeli Affairs. His analysis of the Mideast conflict is markedly pro-Palestinian.  J Street: This anti-Israel group warns that Israel’s choice to take military action to stop Hamas’ terrorist attacks “will prove counter-productive and only deepen the cycle of violence in the region”  Jewish Funds for Justice: This organization views government intervention and taxpayer funding as crucial components of enlightened social policy. It seeks to redistribute wealth from Jewish donors to low-income communities “to combat the root causes of domestic economic and social injustice.” By JFJ’s reckoning, chief among those root causes are the inherently negative by-products of capitalism – most notably racism and “gross economic inequality.”  Joint Victory Campaign 2004: Founded by George Soros and Harold Ickes, this group was a major fundraising entity for Democrats during the 2004 election cycle. It collected contributions (including large amounts from Soros personally) and disbursed them to two other groups, America Coming Together and the Media Fund, which also worked on behalf of Democrats.  Justice at Stake: This coalition calls for judges to be appointed by nonpartisan, independent commissions in a process known as “merit selection,” rather than elected by the voting public.  Latino Justice PRLDF: This organization supports bilingual education, the racial gerrymandering of voting districts, and expanded rights for illegal aliens.  Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law: This group views America as an unremittingly racist nation; uses the courts to mandate race-based affirmative action preferences in business and academia; has filed briefs against the Department of Homeland Security’s efforts to limit the wholesale granting of green cards and to identify potential terrorists; condemns the Patriot Act; and calls on Americans to “recognize the contribution” of illegal aliens.  League of United Latin American Citizens: This group views America as a nation plagued by “an alarming increase in xenophobia and anti-Hispanic sentiment”; favors racial preferences; supports the legalization of illegal Hispanic aliens; opposes military surveillance of U.S. borders; opposes making English America’s official language; favors open borders; and rejects anti-terrorism legislation like the Patriot Act.  League of Women Voters Education Fund: The League supports taxpayer-funded abortion-on-demand; supports “motor-voter” registration, which allows anyone with a driver’s license to become a voter, regardless of citizenship status; and supports tax hikes and socialized medicine.  League of Young Voters: This organization seeks to “empowe[r] young people nationwide” to “participate in the democratic process and create progressive political change on the local, state and national level[s].”  Lynne Stewart Defense Committee: IRS records indicate that Soros’s Open Society Institute made a September 2002 grant of $20,000 to this organization.

Ploughshares Fund: This public grant making foundation opposes America’s development of a missile defense system, and contributes to many organizations that are highly critical of U.S. foreign policies and military ventures.  Prepare New York: This group supported the proposed construction of a Muslim Community Center near Ground Zero in lower Manhattan – a project known as the Cordoba Initiative, headed by Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf.

During the 1980s it championed Communist revolution in Central America and chastised U.S. policy-makers for their tendency “to assume the very worst about their Soviet counterparts.” More recently, Sojourners has taken up the cause of environmental activism, opposed welfare reform as a “mean-spirited Republican agenda,” and mounted a defense of affirmative action.

427,1772,10,9,2017,2017-10-09,Fox News,Facebook: 150 Russia-linked political ads showed up on Instagram,"Facebook has confirmed that about 150 of the political ads linked to Russia during the 2016 U.S. Presidential election appeared on Instagram.  Facebook owns the popular photo-sharing platform.  Last month Facebook announced that it uncovered $100,000 in fake ad spending tied to Russian operatives during the election cycle, associated with around 3,000 ads. The ads were connected to about 470 inauthentic accounts and pages, Facebook said.  FACEBOOK UNCOVERS $100G IN FAKE AD SPENDING TIED TO RUSSIAN OPERATIVES DURING 2016 ELECTION  The tech giant turned the 3,000 ads over to Congress last week. The 3,000 ads were seen by an estimated 10 million people before and after the 2016 election, Facebook said.  In an updated blog post on Friday, Elliot Schrage, Facebook’s vice president of policy and communications, confirmed that some of the ads appeared on the Instagram photo-sharing platform.  “Of the more than 3,000 ads that we have shared with Congress, 5% appeared on Instagram,” he wrote. “About $6,700 was spent on these ads.”  FACEBOOK CEO MARK ZUCKERBERG ASKS FORGIVENESS FOR WAYS HIS 'WORK WAS USED TO DIVIDE PEOPLE'  While the vast majority of 3,000 ads didn’t reference the election, voting, or a particular candidate, they did focus on amplifying divisive social and political messages such as LGBT matters, race, immigration and gun rights, according to Facebook.  The ads were turned over to the House and Senate intelligence committees and the Senate Judiciary Committee on Oct. 2. Facebook already has given similar material to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into the Russian meddling.  During a Facebook Live Chat last month, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that the company would strengthen its ad review process for political ads.  FACEBOOK IS CONTINUING THE FIGHT AGAINST FAKE NEWS WITH A NEW BUTTON  Facebook’s battle with fake political ads comes amid investigations into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election, which Russia denies.  Facebook is not the only social media company probing fake ads. Twitter recently announced it has uncovered several accounts linked to the same alleged Russian activity on Facebook, as well as $274,000 spent on ads by state-owned TV network Russia Today in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. Twitter’s move prompted a scathing response from Russia Today.  The Senate intelligence committee, along with the House intelligence committee, has invited Facebook, Twitter and Google to testify at a public hearing next month. Facebook said last week that it had accepted invitations from both committees, and Twitter confirmed it would testify before the Senate panel on Nov. 1.

1333,2932,11,2,2017,2017-11-02,The New York Times,A Tax Cut That Lifts the Economy? Opinions Are Split,"Yet if the House plan resolves some longstanding issues with the corporate tax code, it also creates new ones. Congress has, in effect, set aside $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years to pay for revisions to the tax code, but to keep the cost of the plan to that limit, the Republican leadership is relying on financing gimmicks to phase in some provisions, or put time limits on others.  A proposal that allows companies to immediately deduct business expenses rather than stretching them over a number of years potentially has the most impact on smaller companies that need money to build up or expand their business. Indeed a hefty chunk of the administration’s growth estimates is based on the extra investing it is supposed to cause.  But the proposal has a five-year time limit. “If expensing goes away at the end of 2022, they should not expect any permanent growth effect,” said Mr. Viard of the American Enterprise Institute.  For businesses, predictability about the tax code is as important as any specific alteration. And temporary measures that obscure the costs deter long-term investment. New low rates and breaks will not be sustainable over the long term if they do not provide enough money to run the government.  “If they want to claim credit for the growth effect,” Mr. Viard said, “then they have to claim responsibility for the revenue loss.”  All would-be tax reformers juggle varying goals. They want to entice domestic and foreign companies to invest in the United States, which should, in turn, produce more jobs and stockholder returns.  They want to create a system that is widely judged as fair.  And they need to collect enough revenue to keep the lights on. That includes having the money to cover Social Security payments, antiterrorism measures and disaster relief, as well as maintaining or upgrading the educational, transportation, technological and other systems that undergird the nation’s overall economic strength.",45.0,51.0

He warned that the United States could wind up facing an economic collapse akin to that in Venezuela, adding that Republicans in the House and Senate had not demonstrated that they possess “the intellectual understanding of the dangers posed by these deficits and accumulated debt.”  Mr. Trump, who has called himself “the king of debt,” may be setting the tone.  During his presidential campaign, he insisted that he could eliminate the national debt in eight years, even as he promised to protect Social Security and Medicare, programs that are projected to consume an ever larger share of federal spending as the country’s population ages.  After Mr. Trump struck a deal with Democrats on a short-term debt limit extension, Representative David Schweikert, Republican of Arizona, asked, “In this entire discussion, how many members have you heard, how many from the White House said, ‘We’re in the middle of a demographic crisis that’s going to crush us in just a few years; let’s get to work on it’?”  He left unsaid the answer to his question: Not many.  The change in tone on fiscal matters has been swift. This spring, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, asserted that the tax overhaul needed to be revenue neutral, citing the nation’s debt and invoking Mr. Trump’s Democratic predecessor.  “We added an enormous amount of debt during the Obama years,” Mr. McConnell said.  Now, Republican lawmakers are betting that economic growth will fix the nation’s fiscal woes with no pain and a lot of gain.  “The only way we’re going to solve our long-term debt and deficit issue to allow the federal government to have the revenue it’s going to need to fund all these promises made is with strong — and I mean strong — economic growth,” said Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin and a member of the Senate Budget Committee. “You’re not going to achieve that with an awful tax system.”  Mr. Kennedy, another member of the budget panel, said Americans have to have faith.  “If we do it right, then the economy will be stimulated appropriately and tax revenues will go up and the deficit won’t increase,” Mr. Kennedy said. “Now, I can’t prove to you that that will happen.

Sandven explains to The Associated Press how investors’ views of the market have evolved and doubled back in the 11 months since the 2016 election. (Courtesy of U.S. Bank Wealth Management via AP)  NEW YORK (AP) — On the surface, the stock market may not have looked any different in September than it did earlier in the year. But even though indexes continued to climb, the market went through a shift.  Starting in late August, banks and industrial companies rose and the dollar got stronger. The Russell 2000 index has climbed 11 percent from mid-August as smaller, U.S.-focused companies made big gains. That’s a change from the way stocks have behaved for much of this year: technology companies and other corporations that do a lot of their business overseas had been soaring as the dollar weakened, and low interest rates have hampered financial company stocks. But if the September pattern sounds familiar, it should: it’s the same trend that dominated the market from the November presidential election through President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January.  Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist for U.S. Bank Wealth Management, explains how investors’ views of the market have evolved and doubled back in the 11th months since the election. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.  Q: Why has the market changed direction in the last few weeks?  A: Tax reform seems to be gaining steam, and that’s boosted sentiment as well as expectations for President Trump’s pro-growth agenda. With tax reform you’re likely to see earnings favorably impacted, and a pro-growth agenda tends to be favorable for small caps as well. So the Russell 2000 has been on a tear. Tax reform tends to be U.S.-centric and is likely to boost earnings, which obviously is favorable for the broad market. Secondly, should a tax reform come to pass and result in an elevated dollar, that could conversely put some pressure on earnings for multinational companies.  Q: So in a lot of ways, stocks are making the same moves they made about a year ago. How is this move different from that one?  A: Following the November election (investors anticipated) a pro-growth agenda, expectations for inflation, deregulation and tax cuts. The pro-growth agenda now is gaining some steam again. The key difference between now and then is we have greater visibility on earnings. Earnings for the S&P 500 are tracking for about a 10 percent increase year over year and in 2018 we’re seeing that same kind of growth. The whole global economy is improving, which means higher earnings and higher earnings mean higher stock prices. We still don’t see a looming recession or ramping inflation. Stocks still provide an opportunity for investors to get yield as well.  Clearly the equity market valuations are elevated, but we think there is valuation support in an environment where inflation is low. But while our outlook remains constructive, clearly risks remain. You do have a flattening yield curve, there’s political wrangling and low expectations on balance and you’ve got geopolitical tensions.  Q: Are there other reasons for those gains, like improvement in the economy?  A: There’s still much to like about the U.S. equity market. Earnings are increasing and generally restrained inflation and low interest rates provide support. The large caps are somewhat in pause mode ahead of third-quarter (earnings) reports. We’re seeing consensus expectations for about a 5-percent increase in earnings year over year and higher earnings still warrant higher stock prices. We like the macroeconomic and fundamentals backdrops.  Q: Have you advised investors to make any changes in response to this market shift?  A: Our message has been the same, really. That is that we like equities over fixed-income securities and we like U.S. stocks over international even though international growth is improving. Nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are in positive territory year to date, (which) implies a market that’s likely to trend higher. Technology and select areas of consumer discretionary and health care remain favorites.  Our year-end price target for the S&P 500 is 2,550, at the midpoint of a range between 2,500 and 2,600. Should tax reform visibility improve and earnings get reported as we expect they will, our sense is that we’ll end the year toward the high side of that range.

241,1494,10,1,2017,2017-10-01,Associated Press News,Report: 32 US states could offer sports betting in 5 years," In this May 19, 2017 file photo, fans place bets ahead of the running of the Black-Eyed Susan horse race at Pimlico race course in Baltimore. Legal sports betting could be offered in 32 states within five years if the U.S. Supreme Court rules in favor of New Jersey's quest to offer such gambling, according to a new report. Major professional and collegiate sports leagues oppose New Jersey's effort to legalize sports betting, saying it would threaten the perceived integrity of the games. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File)  ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) — Legal sports betting could be offered in 32 states within five years if the U.S. Supreme Court rules in favor of New Jersey’s quest to offer such gambling, according to a new report.  Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, LLC, which tracks state-by-state gambling legislation, says a new market would be worth more than $6 billion. If all 50 states got on board, legal sports betting could be worth $7.1 to $15.8 billion, they estimate.  Americans are already betting up to $60 billion annually using offshore sites and bookies, said Chris Grove, managing director for the firm. It’s an industry that generates some $3 billion in revenue each year from U.S. customers.  “We estimate that a properly regulated market could be worth nearly five times that amount, resulting in a financial windfall for sports betting operators, sports leagues and media and state governments alike,” Grove said.  His estimate of the illegal market does not include office pools and “social” or “casual” bets among friends that are included in some other estimates of illegal gambling that peg the market two or three times higher.  Grove said the exact size of the opportunity hinges on how many states decide to offer sports betting, and how willing they are to offer a product that can compete with the sizeable, well-established black market for sports betting.  Responding to the report, David Schwartz, director of the Center for Gaming Research at the University of Nevada Las Vegas, estimated a smaller potential market of about $1.4 billion, assuming each state that currently has casino gambling opts to offer sports betting as well. He also said he does not see all 50 states offering sports betting, at least anytime soon due to entrenched opposition to gambling in a handful of states.  Assuming the high court rules in New Jersey’s favor, Grove’s firm predicted 14 states would offer sports betting within two years: Colorado; Connecticut; Delaware; Indiana; Massachusetts; Michigan; Mississippi; Montana; New Jersey; Ohio; Nevada; Pennsylvania; Virginia; and West Virginia.  Within five years, it predicted 18 more would join: Arizona; California; Idaho; Illinois; Iowa; Kansas; Kentucky; Louisiana; Maine; Maryland; Missouri; New York; North Carolina; North Dakota; Oklahoma; Vermont; Washington and Wyoming.  And within seven years, another dozen could offer it as well: Alabama; Arkansas; Florida; Georgia; Minnesota; Nebraska; New Hampshire; New Mexico; Oregon; Rhode Island; South Dakota and Wisconsin. The remaining states might never offer sports betting, the Eilers & Krejcik Gaming report predicted.  The company’s estimates of when particular states might offer sports betting were determined by weighing questions including whether a state already has pending legislation, if there are Constitutional obstacles to expanding gambling; whether their gambling industry is united or divided; the general legislative attitude toward gambling as it exists now in a particular state, and how badly a state needs extra money.  Major professional and collegiate sports leagues oppose New Jersey’s effort to legalize sports betting, saying it would threaten the perceived integrity of the games.  New Jersey is taking aim at a law called the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 that forbids state-authorized sports gambling in all but four states that met a 1991 deadline to legalize it: Delaware, Montana, Nevada and Oregon. Nevada is the only state to allow single-game wagering.  ___  This story has been corrected to show Grove’s betting estimate is $60 billion, not $60 million.  ___  Follow Wayne Parry at http://twitter.com/WayneParryAC",13.0,22.0

The tool purportedly aims to help readers better understand where the news they’re reading comes from and the possible bias of the publisher. Facebook has faced pressure from both the U.S. government and the European Union to closely monitor the content posted to their platform.  In December of 2016, Facebook was warned by the European Union that they must stop “hate speech” on their platform or face harsh punishments, EU Justice Commissioner Věra Jourová told The Financial Times: “If Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Microsoft want to convince me and the ministers that the non-legislative approach can work, they will have to act quickly and make a strong effort in the coming months.” She continued to say, “The last weeks and months have shown that social media companies need to live up to their important role and take up their share of responsibility when it comes to phenomena like online radicalization, illegal hate speech or fake news.”  Facebook has also recently come under fire after it was discovered that Russian-linked sources had purchased approximately $100,000 worth of political ads on the platform during the 2016 presidential election. Facebook claims that most of the advertisements did not contain information about particular political candidates but rather focused on key political issues.",15.0,23.0
1358,2957,11,3,2017,2017-11-03,Fox News,Uber prepares next generation of self-driving cars,"Uber’s next generation of self-driving cars could be on the road as early as the end of this year.  The second generation of its autonomous vehicles is being developed on Uber’s test track, an Uber spokeswoman told Fox News.  Uber's self-driving vehicles made their debut in Pittsburgh in 2016 and have been picking up passengers ever since.  Current models require one or two vehicle operators, Uber Hardware Engineer Brian Zajac told Fox News. An Uber employee sits in the driver's seat and is ready to take over the vehicle when the computer system tells the opertator it needs to go off self-driving mode. Another employee sits in the passenger seat monitoring a map that displays what the vehicle's sensors see in real-time, including bikers, pedestrians and other vehicles. Customers can see what the car ""sees"" through an iPad provided in the back seat.  The next generation is a step closer to having no vehicle operators, Zajac said.  “In the far future, there won’t be any vehicle operator,” Zajac said. “The car rolls up, there’s no human inside at all, and the customer gets in and takes a ride.”  Some of the more immediate changes, which will be incorporated into the third generation of autonomous vehicles, are not easily visible.  “From the outside, a lot looks the same, but under the hood, we’ve made a whole bunch of improvements,” Zajac said.  One of those improvements is a higher resolution set of cameras.  “That extra resolution allows the sensors to see a little bit farther which allows the system to drive a little bit faster,” Zajac said.  The cameras will also have a better cleaning system for inclement weather.  “It’s been redesigned to handle heavier rain and to handle other types of contamination that gets on our cameras,” Zajac said.  The camera system will also have fewer parts to assemble, which would make it easier to mass produce in the future.  Current models have limited trunk space that’s shared with computer equipment. The new version will give passengers the full trunk space of the vehicle.  “You’ll see it’s a nice big open trunk that you can throw all of your luggage, jump in the car and go to the airport or wherever you might be headed,” Zajac said.  For now, Uber’s newest release will not change the passenger experience too much, a spokeswoman said.  Zajac said the engineers will keep pushing toward the goal of full autonomy.  “This is kind of uncharted territory for a lot of companies but there’s a lot of really good other industries we can draw from such as aerospace and the automotive industry,” he said.",5.0,2.0

On Tuesday, that regulation became the latest of those reversed by the Trump administration, before the requirement was to go into effect next year.  Pay transparency, alone, would not have solved the pay gap problem. But without it, employees and regulators won’t have evidence that a problem exists at any particular company — and employers will face less pressure to fix it.  There is little data on whether forcing companies to disclose pay makes it more equitable, mostly because the pay of individual workers or companies is generally kept secret. The Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys companies about compensation, but publishes only aggregate, anonymous data. Researchers who have studied the few instances in which companies have publicly disclosed individual salaries say it is not enough to close pay gaps, nor is it essential — some companies have closed them on their own, without publicly reporting pay information.",1.0,2.0

Search teams have been making every effort to locate Malaysia Airlines' missing aircraft after itdisappeared with 239 passengers and crew during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014.  With the relatives of those on board MH370 still desperate to know what happened on that fateful flight more than three years ago, and an entire industry equally keen for answers to this enduring mystery, the Malaysian government is now talking to a U.S. firm about the possibility of a new search effort that could work on a ""no find, no fee"" basis.  The government confirmed in recent days that it's in discussions with Ocean Infinity, a seabed exploration firm based in Houston, Texas. If it gets the green light, Ocean Infinity could bear the cost of the search effort and only receive payment if it locates the missing aircraft.  Operating from its main multi-purpose ship, Ocean Infinity uses a range of autonomous vehicles to conduct its searches, including six underwater machines that are able to operate at a depth of 6,000 meters while collecting high-definition imagery from even deeper.Six unmanned surface vehicles work with the submersibles to ensure precise positioning and constant communication, the company explains on its website.  Ocean Infinity  Searching for a missing plane would be a first for Ocean Infinity, but it has growing experience using its deep-sea technology for operations such as seabed mapping and imaging, marine geological surveys, and environmental monitoring.  Endless search?  With costs spiraling, lengthy multi-national search effort covering nearly 50,000 square miles of the southern Indian Ocean was called off at the start of this year.  It's believed that a future search, possibly to be conducted by Ocean Infinity, will center on an area of interest of around 10,000 square miles identified by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, which the Australian Transport Safety Bureau said offers a ""high probability"" of revealing the missing plane.  The Malaysian government said it had received ""several"" proposals from private firms interested in resuming the search for the missing plane, and that having assessed the inquiries it is now ""negotiating the terms and conditions with Ocean Infinity.""",35.0,23.0

Bill Walker addresses reporters during a news conference in Juneau, Alaska. The state of Alaska will attempt to advance a multibillion dollar natural gas pipeline project with the help of interests from China. Walker said the agreement signed late Wednesday, Nov. 8, 2017, is with Sinopec, China Investment Corp. and the Bank of China. (AP Photo/Becky Bohrer, File)  ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — The latest push in a decades-long effort to commercialize vast stores of Alaska’s natural gas got a boost when the state announced a deal with three Chinese companies. But the $43 billion project is far from reality.  The agreement advances a project to move gas through a pipeline to the Alaska coast, where it would be liquefied and shipped to China and other points in Asia. U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping looked on as Alaska’s governor and representatives from the companies signed the deal Thursday in Beijing.  But the fanfare does not ensure one shovelful of tundra gets overturned. Similar efforts to build a natural gas pipeline have fizzled repeatedly.  Here’s a look at the new project:  WHAT’S THE PLAN?  Alaska’s prodigious North Slope is known for its vast deposit of oil, which fueled construction of the 800-mile trans-Alaska oil pipeline in the 1970s. Since then, oil production has declined, and the recession-racked state hopes to tap into natural gas to fill the gaps.  The North Slope has proven gas reserves over 35 trillion cubic feet, but no way to move it. State efforts to find partners willing to shell out billions for a pipeline have flopped over the years, with major oil companies the latest to step away. Gov. Bill Walker has since courted Asian markets.  Sinopec, the Bank of China and China Investment Corp. signed on, but financial terms have not been released. Walker said 75 percent of the gas would be earmarked for China, and Alaska would keep the rest to sell to other Asian markets. The state would be the majority owner.  Walker said he wants final agreements in place by the end of next year, with groundbreaking in 2019.  The plan includes building a gas treatment plant on the North Slope, a pipeline that would go 800 miles to the town of Nikiski and a liquefaction plant there. Walker anticipates all of it to be running about five years later.  Larry Persily, former U.S. coordinator for Alaska natural gas projects, said it could cost $1 billion to get to that point, and he doesn’t think the timeline is realistic.  “But if the first tanker left the dock in 2025 instead of 2023 or 2026, everyone would still be ecstatic,” he said.  WHY DID OIL COMPANIES BACK OUT?  BP, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips had been working on the pipeline plan but backed away to concentrate on other projects. That left pipeline skeptics wondering, Persily said.  “If companies don’t think this is a good time to put their money into it, why should the state?” he said. “As the governor has explained, the state has an overriding interest in getting this done — companies have other places they can invest their money.”  The Chinese companies also don’t have the same shareholder pressures as U.S firms.  “From what I’ve seen from China, they make decisions like this and they pursue them generally to completion as a matter of strategy and are less worried about some of the short-term economics,” said Mark Barteau, director of the University of Michigan’s Energy Institute.  WHY CHINA?  It has an insatiable need for natural gas as it struggles with pollution and tries to end its reliance on coal.  “They have exhibited a long-term interest in having a large and secure gas supply, and I think this is just perhaps the largest — but by no means the first — step they’ve taken to achieve that,” said Barteau, who also serves on the science advisory board for the National Institute of Clean and Low Carbon Energy in Beijing.  Charlie Riedl, executive director of Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group the Center for Liquefied Natural Gas, sees no reason to be skeptical, saying the Chinese have wanted to get involved in a natural gas project in the U.S. for some time.  The agreement “is a really positive indicator that there is demand, and there is an appetite in Asia for this gas, and the proximity to market being in Alaska is obviously a good thing,” he said.  WHAT ARE THE DOWNSIDES?  Without seeing the details of the agreement, some analysts pointed to the large amount of gas earmarked for China and the possible terms of the deal.  Barteau said he assumes it would guarantee pricing for a set period.  “If gas prices were to go way up, and we’re locked in selling it at bargain basement prices, that wouldn’t be such a good deal down the line,” he said.  Persily said that if Alaska contracts to sell three-quarters of the gas to one nation, it would “be stuck with one big customer that you sink or swim with.”  WHAT DO ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY?  The Center for Biological Survey called the project a “massively terrible idea” and expects legal action if the Trump administration fast-tracks it or skirts permit requirements in environmental laws.  “It is just a massive investment in new fossil fuel infrastructure at a time when we should be rapidly transitioning to clean energy, and it’s just the wrong decision,” said Kristen Monsell, an attorney for the environmental group.  Her concern is not only what extracting the gas from the ground might do to the environment but also increased tanker activity through habitat of the endangered Pacific right whale.  Another environmental group didn’t foresee plans to stall the pipeline, calling it a safer option than opening up part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling, said Lois Epstein with The Wilderness Society.",4.0,9.0

824,2275,10,19,2017,2017-10-19,Associated Press News,Judge won’t throw out ruling explaining Arpaio’s conviction," The judge in former Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s now-pardoned criminal case has refused the retired lawman’s request to throw out all rulings in the case, including a blistering decision that explained her reasoning in finding him guilty of a crime.  The request denied Thursday by U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton was aimed at clearing Arpaio’s name and barring the ruling’s use in future court cases as an example of a prior bad act.  Bolton said pardons don’t erase convictions or the facts of cases. She said the pardon issued by President Donald Trump only mooted Arpaio’s possible punishments.  “The pardon undoubtedly spared defendant from any punishment that might otherwise have been imposed,” Bolton wrote. “It did not, however, ‘revise the historical facts’ of this case.”  Arpaio’s attorneys appealed Thursday’s decision to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.  The conviction stemmed from Arpaio’s disobedience of a 2011 court order that barred his traffic patrols that targeted immigrants. Prosecutors had accused Arpaio of prolonging the patrols for 17 months so that he could promote his immigration enforcement efforts in a bid to boost his successful 2012 re-election campaign.  Arpaio, who endorsed Trump and appeared alongside him at rallies during the 2016 campaign, has acknowledged prolonging the patrols, but insisted his disobedience wasn’t intentional and blamed one of his former attorneys for not adequately explaining the order’s importance.  Critics say the Aug. 25 pardon removed the last chance at holding Arpaio legally accountable for a long history of misconduct, including a 2013 civil verdict in which Arpaio’s officers were found to have racially profiled Latinos in the sheriff’s immigration patrols.  The sheriff’s defiance of the court order is believed to have contributed to his 2016 election loss after serving 24 years as metro Phoenix’s top law enforcer.  Several legal advocacy groups had requested that the pardon be declared invalid or unconstitutional, arguing that letting it stand would encourage future violations of court orders.  Earlier this month, Bolton ruled that the pardon will stand and dismissed the case.  ___  Follow Jacques Billeaud at twitter.com/jacquesbilleaud.

He said lawmakers possibly can avoid that wrath if they disavow McConnell and meet other conditions.  ""This is our war,"" Bannon said. ""The establishment started it. ... You all are gonna finish it.""  But Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said, “Mitch McConnell’s not our problem. Our problem is that we promised to repeal and replace ObamaCare, and we failed. We promised to cut taxes and we have yet to do it.”  The senator added: ""If we're successful, Mitch McConnell's fine. If we're not, we're all in trouble. We lose our majority and I think President Trump will not get reelected.""  Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate from Maine who was a critical “no” vote on health care, said Bannon’s rhetoric is what Americans are tired of.  ""They don't want this hyperpartisanship. They want us to work together. And they want us to get things done,"" she said.  Collins added that ""over-the-top rhetoric is not helpful. Mitch McConnell is the Senate majority leader. The president needs him. I'm glad they're working together on tax reform and a lot of other issues. And I'm glad they're meeting this week.""  In August, Trump tweeted blame for failure to repeal ObamaCare on McConnell, saying, “Can you believe that Mitch McConnell, who has screamed Repeal & Replace for 7 years, couldn’t get it done. Must Repeal & Replace ObamaCare!”  McConnell responded to Trump’s Twitter barrage by saying the challenges of governing shouldn’t be a surprise.  ""A lot of people look at all that and find it frustrating, messy. Well, welcome to the democratic process. That's the way it is in our country,"" McConnell said at a GOP event in Kentucky this summer.  Meanwhile, the senators’ weeklong recess also drew criticism from the White House.  ""They're on another vacation right now. I think that we would all be a lot better off if the Senate would stop taking vacations, and start staying here until we actually get some real things accomplished,"" Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said.  Recently, a McConnell-backed political committee spent millions and Trump endorsed Alabama Sen. Luther Strange in a recent primary election, but Bannon-backed Roy Moore prevailed. Moore, a former judge, has defied federal court orders, described Islam as a false religion and called homosexuality evil.  Senate Republicans had been upbeat about adding to their 52-48 edge in the chamber, especially with Democrats defending more seats next year — 10 in states Trump won in last year's presidential election. But the Bannon challenge could cost them, leaving incumbents on the losing end in primaries or GOP candidates roughed up for the general election.  ""If we don't cut taxes and we don't eventually repeal and replace ObamaCare, then we're going to lose across the board in the House in 2018. And all of my colleagues running in primaries in 2018 will probably get beat. It will be the end of Mitch McConnell as we know it. So this is a symptom of a greater problem,"" Graham said.  He added that Bannon ""can't beat us if we're successful. And if we're not successful, it doesn't matter who tries to beat us, they'll be successful.""

921,2412,10,23,2017,2017-10-23,Associated Press News,Senate advances $36.5 billion disaster relief package," In this Sept. 28, 2017, file photo, debris scatters a destroyed community in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Toa Alta, Puerto Rico. The Senate is pushing ahead on a $36.5 billion hurricane relief package that would give Puerto Rico a much-needed infusion of cash but rejects requests from the powerful Texas and Florida congressional delegations for additional money to rebuild after hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The measure is sure to sail through a Monday, Oct. 23, procedural vote and a final vote is expected no later than Tuesday. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate on Monday gave a preliminary OK to a $36.5 billion hurricane relief package that would provide Puerto Rico with a much-needed infusion of cash and keep the federal flood insurance program from running out of money to pay claims.  The 79-16 procedural vote set the stage for a final vote, most likely Tuesday.  The measure also provides $18.7 billion to replenish the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s rapidly dwindling emergency disaster accounts. On Monday, FEMA announced more than $500 million in aid to Puerto Rico, including $285 million to help restore power and water services to the devastated island. An additional $16 billion would permit the financially troubled federal flood insurance program to pay an influx of Harvey-related claims.  But the bill rejects requests from the powerful Texas and Florida congressional delegations for additional money to rebuild after hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Florida Democrat Bill Nelson, whose state’s citrus industry endured significant losses during Irma, sought to add $3 billion in immediate agriculture assistance to the measure, but was denied by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who said money for crop losses would be in subsequent aid measures.  Senate passage on Tuesday would send the measure to President Donald Trump for his signature.  There was urgency to move the measure swiftly — rather than add more money to it at this time — because the government’s disaster response and flood insurance reserves are running out. Democrat Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont said that would happen “in a matter of days” without action.  Still, members of the Texas and Florida delegations in Congress are unhappy because the measure failed to address extensive requests for additional hurricane rebuilding money. Texas, inundated by Harvey in August, requested $19 billion, while Florida sought $27 billion.  “I’m pretty disappointed with what the House sent over,” Texas GOP Sen. John Cornyn said last week. But later, after speaking to both Trump and White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, Cornyn said he was promised that the White House would issue another disaster aid measure next month for Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico. A fourth, and perhaps final, measure is likely to anchor a year-end spending bill.  “The victims of these hurricanes can continue to count on our support,” said McConnell said.  Up to $5 billion of the measure’s total could be used to assist Puerto Rico’s central government and various municipalities that are suffering unsustainable cash shortfalls as Maria has choked off revenues and strained resources. An additional $150 million would help Puerto Rico with the 10 percent match required for FEMA disaster relief.  More than one-fourth of the island’s residents don’t have potable running water and only 17 percent have electricity, according to FEMA. Just 392 miles of Puerto Rico’s 5,073 miles of roads are open. Conditions in the U.S. Virgin Islands are bad as well, with widespread power outages.  But Trump last week graded his response to the Puerto Rico disaster a 10 on a scale of 10.  “President Trump seems more concerned about claiming credit for a job well done than the actual situation on the ground deserves, particularly in Puerto Rico,” Leahy said. “This is the hard part of governing,” he added. “We dig in for the long haul, we stop patting ourselves on the back.”  The measure currently before the Senate contains $577 million for wildfires in the West that forced agencies to tap other reserves for firefighting accounts and FEMA money.  Republicans delayed action last year on modest requests by President Barack Obama to combat the Zika virus and help Flint, Michigan, repair its lead-tainted water system. But they are moving quickly to take care of this year’s alarming series of disasters, quickly passing a $15.3 billion relief measure last month and signaling that another installment is coming next month.  Damage is still being assessed and final cost estimates for recovering and rebuilding from this year’s hurricane season are not in yet. Some House conservatives are becoming restive at the high price tag for the disasters, which come as the deficit is growing.",3.0,14.0
1457,3104,11,6,2017,2017-11-06,Vox,Read: Rep. Kevin Brady’s amendment to the House’s tax reform bill,"When House Republicans released their bill last Thursday morning — one day after they initially said they would — they said it was not the final product. Far from it.  On the first day of the bill’s markup, tax-focused Ways and Means Committee Chair Kevin Brady (R-TX) offered an amendment that would delay the repeal of tax-free savings accounts for dependent care and amend the tax on private university endowments to affect schools with endowments amassing to $250,000 per student, instead of $100,000 per student, among other changes.  After months releasing vague outlines and broad plans, House Republicans are finally working through legislative text on tax reform.  Their proposal radically cuts the corporate taxes, collapses individual tax rates from seven brackets to four, and substantially expands the standard deduction and child tax credit for individuals.  The bill reduced the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, expands the child tax credit from $1,000 to $1,600, caps the state and local property tax deduction at $10,000, leaves retirement savings accounts unchanged, and reduces the tax rate for small businesses to 25 percent.  Republicans, frantically hoping to pass tax reform by Christmas — for fear that their first year controlling both Congress and the White House will come to an end with no major legislative victories — have spent weeks debating behind closed doors and avoiding the tough decisions.  This bill is House Republicans’ opening bid on tax reform, a proposal that will likely undergo a lot of scrutiny from the party and outside interests. The Senate is expected to release its own version of the bill this week, and plans to go through markup as soon as the House has concluded theirs. Then Republicans must come to an agreement between the two chambers.  Overhauling the nation’s tax code comes with a lot of winners and losers, and as Obamacare repeal already showed, Republicans can’t just expect their members to fall in line on a major agenda item. The party is unified in its goal to cut taxes, but has been struggling within its ranks over how deeply to lower rates and whether to pay for the tax cuts.

3,80,8,29,2017,2017-08-29,The New York Times,"Trump Tax Plan May Free Up Corporate Dollars, but Then What?","If taxing foreign earnings that have already accumulated overseas is difficult, so is eliminating incentives that reward companies for continuing to keep profits in tax havens. To that end, Mr. Trump and the Republican leadership have pushed to slash the corporate tax rate and switch to what is known as a territorial system that would tax only profits earned in the United States and not those earned in other countries.  Mihir Desai, an economist at Harvard Business School, likes that approach. “We currently have the worst of all worlds,” he wrote in an email. “We have a high marginal rate,” which encourages companies to avoid taxes and puts the United States at a global disadvantage.  “And we have low average rates” — because of all the loopholes — “which indicate that we’re not collecting as much as we used to, given the very high level of corporate profits.”  The crucial questions are how to pay for a lower rate and how to prevent abuses. Corporate tax cuts that lead to huge deficits could hobble the economy. And a territorial system without sufficient safeguards could end up encouraging even more businesses to shift profits, operations and jobs to countries with lower tax rates.  Other nations with territorial systems have tried to prevent companies from wriggling out of paying taxes, while tax experts have suggested proposals ranging from a minimum global tax to tighter rules to prevent companies from relocating their patents and copyrights to tax havens like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands.  But skeptics worry that making the system airtight is impossible. “It’s an endless cat-and-mouse game,” said Matthew Gardner, senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a research group based in Washington. “What’s driving companies to engage in paper transactions is not our 35 percent tax rate,” he said, but other countries’ willingness to undercut whatever rate the United States settles on. “You can never win if you are competing against their zero tax rate.”  Mr. Gardner argued that a broader definition of American competitiveness is needed that includes not only the tax system, but also the business infrastructure that the tax system supports — bridges and roads, health care, education and research and development. “If all you think about is the tax rate, then it should be zero,” he said. “Competitiveness is about finding the right balance.”",2.0,0.0

Day by day, the accusations pile up, as scores of women come forward to say they were victims of Weinstein. But others with stories to tell have not. For some of these women who’ve chosen not to go public, the fear of being associated forever with the sordid scandal _ and the effects on their careers, and their lives _ might be too great. Or they may still be struggling with the lingering effects of their encounters. (Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP, File)  LOS ANGELES (AP) — Authorities in Los Angeles and New York said Thursday they had opened new investigations into Harvey Weinstein, the latest in a series of criminal probes into conduct by the disgraced film mogul which has sparked a sexual harassment scandal roiling Hollywood and other industries.  The Manhattan district attorney’s office said a senior prosecutor has been assigned to investigate allegations by “Boardwalk Empire” actress Paz de la Huerta, who told CBS News that Weinstein raped her twice in her apartment in 2010. Spokeswoman Joan Vollero said New York police were also involved, but further details could not be provided.  De la Huerta spoke to CBS News by phone and said the first rape occurred in October 2010 after Weinstein gave her a ride home from a party, insisted on having a drink in her apartment and forced himself on her. She said the second rape occurred in December 2010 after Weinstein came to her apartment; she had been drinking and was not in a condition to give consent, CBS reported the actress said.  Los Angeles police are investigating allegations about Weinstein that occurred in 2015, but spokesman Josh Rubenstein said he could not provide any additional details. The department is also investigating a report by an Italian actress and model who said she was raped by Weinstein in 2013.  Charlotte Triggs, senior editor for People Magazine, discusses the sexual harassment, abuse and assault allegations leveled against some of Hollywood's biggest stars. (Nov. 2)  Weinstein representative Sallie Hofmeister reiterated a statement that Weinstein, 65, denies all allegations of non-consensual sex.  Authorities in Beverly Hills and London are also investigating Weinstein for possible criminal cases.  The investigations came four weeks after The New York Times published an expose of sexual harassment allegations against Weinstein, leading to his firing from the company he co-founded and his expulsion from the producers guild and the organization that bestows the Academy Awards.  The accusations against Weinstein have prompted numerous allegations of sexual harassment and abuse against powerful men in Hollywood and other industries.  CNN reported on Thursday that eight current or former “House of Cards” workers claim that Kevin Spacey made the production a “toxic” workplace and one ex-employee alleges the actor sexually assaulted him.  The workers’ identities were withheld from Thursday’s report because they fear professional fallout, the cable news channel said.  Among them is a former production assistant who alleged that Spacey assaulted him during one of the Netflix show’s early seasons, and CNN reported that all of the people described Spacey’s behavior as predatory.  The report accuses Spacey of allegedly targeting staffers who were typically young and male with nonconsensual touching and crude comments.  Netflix has suspended production on the series, which was slated to end after its sixth season. The streaming service and “House of Cards” producers said Thursday that one allegation against Spacey involved a remark and gesture made during production of the show’s first season in 2012. After, Spacey willingly participated in training and producer Media Rights Capital said it was not aware of any additional complaints against the actor since then.  The production company said it has instituted a hotline for complaints and will investigate them thoroughly. There was no word on the fate of “House of Cards” in Thursday’s statements.  A person with knowledge of the decision said late Thursday that Spacey’s publicist and talent agency CAA have parted ways with the actor. His representatives on Wednesday said the two-time Oscar winner was in treatment for an unspecified condition.  Also on Thursday, actor Corey Feldman appeared on “The Dr. Oz Show” and named the man who he said molested him when he was a young teen.  Feldman made his comments in an interview with series host Mehmet Oz and in an on-air call that Oz identified as being to the Los Angeles Police Department.  Los Angeles Police Department Officer Drake Madison says the department is aware of the show, but no report has yet been filed.  The Associated Press is withholding his name because the man could not be located to comment on Feldman’s allegations.  Feldman, 46, gained fame in the 1980s with films including “Gremlins,” ″The Goonies” and “Stand by Me.”  While the outcome of criminal investigations into allegations against Weinstein remains unclear, the producer may have to give sworn testimony in a lawsuit he filed against his former company.  Attorneys for The Weinstein Co. told a Delaware judge on Thursday that they want to take sworn testimony from the producer, who is suing to gain access to his personnel file and emails.  Weinstein’s seeking the records to defend himself in potential civil and criminal cases, and to help the company respond to a civil rights investigation by New York’s attorney general.  The judge said Weinstein could be deposed, even though his attorney said a deposition would be “tricky” and “fraught with problems,” given the ongoing criminal investigations. The attorney said Weinstein’s ability to testify would be limited without waiving his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination.  ___  AP Television Writer Lynn Elber and Entertainment Writer Anthony McCartney in Los Angeles, AP writer Randall Chase in Dover, Delaware, contributed to this report.",88.0,101.0

U.S. stocks are off to a mixed start on Wall Street, Friday, Sept. 29, 2017, as gains in big technology companies are partly offset by losses in energy and industrial stocks. Chipmaker Nvidia and business software maker Oracle both rose. (AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews, File)  NEW YORK (AP) — Large technology and health care companies and smaller U.S.-focused firms rose again Friday as stocks finished the third quarter at record highs.  Stocks were mixed at the start of trading, as they had been the day before. But chipmakers and big-name technology companies pulled stocks higher, as they have done all year. Health care companies also did better than the rest of the market. Tyson Foods climbed after it gave strong profit forecasts, and investors cheered strong quarterly results from homebuilder KB Home.  The market ended the quarter on a four-day winning streak that began after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said the central bank plans to continue to raising interest rates.  “It’s all about the confidence they have that despite low inflation, it still makes sense to raise interest rates,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. “She’s confident in the economy and the economic backdrop is very solid.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 9.30 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,519.36. The Dow Jones industrial average turned higher to finish with a gain of 23.89 points, or 0.1 percent, at 22,405.09. The Nasdaq composite jumped 42.51 points, or 0.7 percent, to 6,495.96. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both closed at all-time highs.  The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks added 2.08 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,490.86. It’s also at record highs after a big rally this month. It climbed 6 percent in September as investors felt positive about the U.S. economy and hoped Congress and President Donald Trump’s administration will reduce taxes.  Tyson Foods jumped after the food company raised its annual guidance and said profits for its beef business were better than expected. Thanks in part to cost cuts, Tyson also forecast a bigger profit than analysts expected for next year.  Tyson climbed $5, or 7.6 percent, to $70.45. The stock gained more ground Friday than it had for the rest of this year put together. Rival Hormel Foods, whose brands include Skippy, rose 43 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $32.14. Those companies and their competitors have struggled in recent years as Americans look for fresher food options.  Technology companies rose further and were the best-performing S&P 500 sector in the third quarter. They also held that distinction in the first quarter. The S&P 500 technology index has climbed 26 percent in 2017, while the S&P 500 is up 12.5 percent.  Facebook added $2.14, or 1.3 percent, to $170.87 and chip equipment maker Applied Materials rose $1.47, or 2.9 percent, to $52.09. Chipmaker Nvidia advanced $3.09, or 1.8 percent, to $178.77.  The recent gains for tech companies have come in spite of a slump for Apple, the world’s most valuable publicly-traded company. While Apple has soared this year, it’s down 4 percent since it announced its new line of iPhones and other products Sept. 12.  KB Home advanced after its third-quarter profit and sales beat estimates. The stock rose $1.90, or 8.6 percent, to $24.12. Other homebuilders also rose. Meritage Homes picked up 85 cents, or 2 percent, to $44.40 and D.R. Horton advanced 95 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $39.93.  Oil prices recovered and turned higher just before the close of trading. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 11 cents to $51.67 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, rose 13 cents to $57.54 a barrel in London.  U.S. crude oil rose 12 percent in the third quarter, which helped energy companies do better than the rest of the market. But on Friday those companies gave back some of their recent gains.  Stocks have risen for eight quarters in a row, and Frederick, of the Schwab Center, said he expects that to continue in the fourth quarter as the global economy is likely to keep growing and interest rates in the U.S. should rise more, which will help profits for banks. However Frederick said it’s possible that concerns about domestic politics, including the federal debt limit, or international concerns such as tensions with North Korea will weigh on stocks again, as they did at times in the third quarter.  In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline slid 3 cents to $1.61 a gallon. Heating oil declined 2 cents to $1.81 a gallon. Natural gas gave up 1 cent to $3.01 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Trump is on a five-country trip through Asia traveling to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)  BEIJING (AP) — The standoff over North Korea’s nuclear weapons and demands that China do more to balance trade with America will dominate President Donald Trump’s agenda in Beijing.  Trump’s meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping will be grander than their informal April talks at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. That visit was most memorable for Trump informing Xi about ordering a missile strike on Syria while they ate a dessert of chocolate cake.  Officials from both sides say Trump has forged a personal connection with Xi, and Chinese officials have said they expect the leaders to continue to have “in-depth, constructive, friendly and productive” talks.  Xi was named last month to a second five-year term as the leader of China’s Communist Party at a congress that elevated his status as China’s most powerful leader in decades. In a recent interview, Trump likened Xi to “a king.”  A look at the thorny issues the two leaders will likely discuss:  ___  NORTH KOREA  China is North Korea’s chief trading partner and source of aid and diplomatic support, and Trump has pressed for Beijing to take more forceful measures against Pyongyang.  China has already agreed to tough new U.N. penalties that would substantially cut foreign revenue for the isolated North. It has ordered North Korean-owned businesses and ventures with Chinese partners to close by early January. China also has promised to cut off gas and limit shipments of refined petroleum products, effective Jan. 1.  Beijing, however, adamantly opposes steps that could bring down North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un’s government. Thus China has made no mention of crude oil, which makes up the bulk of Chinese energy supplies to North Korea and is not covered by U.N. sanctions.  China argues that sanctions alone cannot solve the impasse, and has urged Washington to cool its rhetoric and open a dialogue with North Korea. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters last month that Washington has lines of communication to Pyongyang.  ___  TRADE  Trump wants to narrow China’s trade surplus with the United States, which stood at $347 billion in 2016, but has yet to say what he might propose this week.  Washington has raised duties on Chinese goods including stainless steel and plywood to offset what it says are improper subsidies and is investigating whether Beijing improperly pressures foreign companies to hand over technology.  Some American companies worry that Trump’s focus on trade in goods might mean he pays too little attention to other issues such as Chinese rules that limit their presence in finance, health care and other service industries.  Chinese officials have rejected U.S. accusations that China engages in predatory policies at the expense of its neighbors.  ___  SOUTH CHINA SEA  China and the U.S. are at odds over Beijing’s military buildup, island-building and assertive claims to disputed islands in the South China Sea.  Washington has criticized such moves and says it has a national interest in freedom of navigation in sea lanes critical for world trade. Tillerson said last month that China’s “provocative actions” in the waters are a challenge to international law and norms.  But China says the U.S. has no territorial claim in those waters and should let countries in the region manage their own disputes.  “I think it would certainly be better if others, including the United States, would not try to interfere in this constructive process,” China’s ambassador to the U.S., Cui Tiankai, told reporters in Washington last week.  ___  MARKET ACCESS, DATA CONTROLS  The American Chamber of Commerce in China wants Beijing to ease market barriers such as limits on foreign ownership of enterprises in finance and other industries.  The chamber has called for faster approval of new seeds and agriculture-related biotechnology. Foreign business groups express concern that Chinese plans for government-led development of electric cars and other technology will limit their presence in emerging industries.  U.S. companies also say increasing Chinese restrictions on internet use, the movement of data and the use of foreign security technology hamper their business and give local competitors an unfair advantage.  Foreign business groups have appealed to Beijing to scale back or scrap rules that Chinese officials say will safeguard national security and personal privacy but that companies warn might weaken data protections. Trump has yet to say what action his government might take.  Twitter is among the platforms blocked by Chinese censors.  Asked whether Trump would be able to tweet from Beijing, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang told reporters on Friday, “We take everything into account on receiving foreign heads of state, so you should have no reservations about Mr. President’s ability to keep in touch with the outside.”  ___  OPIOIDS  Trump has said he will make China’s connection to the U.S. opioid crisis a major theme of his talks.  Chinese officials have disputed Trump’s claim that the opioid fentanyl, which is flooding the U.S., is produced mostly in China. China doesn’t deny that some fentanyl produced illicitly inside the country makes its way to the United States, but officials say there is no data proving the majority of fentanyl used in the U.S. comes from China.  Trump said last month that the U.S. was stepping up measures to curb the flow of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid. He has said he would mention it to Xi.  “And he will do something about it,” Trump said.",8.0,3.0
528,1919,10,12,2017,2017-10-12,The New York Times,N.F.L. Players May Have an Ally in Their Protests: Labor Law,"As National Football League team owners consider President Trump’s call to fire players who refuse to stand for the national anthem, they have stumbled into one of the most consequential debates in today’s workplace: How far can workers go in banding together to address problems related to their employment?  In principle, the answer in the N.F.L. and elsewhere may be: Quite far.  To the extent that most people think about the reach of federal labor law, they probably imagine a union context — like organizing workers, or bargaining as a group across the table from management.  As it happens, the law is much more expansive, protecting any “concerted activities” that employees engage in to support one another in the workplace, whether or not a union is involved. The National Labor Relations Board and the courts have defined such activity to include everything from airing complaints about one’s boss through social media to publicly supporting political causes that have some bearing on one’s work life.  The league’s operations manual says players must be on the sidelines during the anthem and should stand. While the law might not bear on whether an individual player can kneel during the anthem, many experts say it could protect players from repercussions for making such a gesture together — or taking other action — to show solidarity on the job.",69.0,55.0
53,286,7,5,2017,2017-07-05,Vox,Car companies' vision of a gradual transition to self-driving cars has a big problem,"aiAn important moment in the self-diving car debate came on May 7, 2016, when Joshua Brown lost his life after his Tesla vehicle crashed into a semi-truck trailer. Brown had engaged Tesla’s Autopilot feature, and the software didn’t detect the white side of the trailer against the daytime sky. The car slammed into the truck at full speed — 74 miles per hour — shearing off the top of the car and killing Brown.  The accident — characterized by many as the first of self-driving car accident — caught the attention of the National Transportation Safety Board, which released hundreds of pages of new details about the incident last month.  But the industry that’s trying to make self-driving a reality takes exception with this characterization. Tesla argued that autopilot is not a self-driving technology, but more like an advanced form of cruise control. Drivers need to keep hands on the wheel and their eyes on the road at all times when Autopilot is engaged, the company says. Computer logs released by the NTSB last month show that Brown’s car warned him seven times to keep his hands on the wheel. Each time, Brown put his hands on the wheel for a few seconds — long enough to make the warnings go away — before taking them off again.  In January, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration sided with Tesla in the case, concluding that the Autopilot system wasn’t defective. “Not all systems can do all things,” said agency spokesman Bryan Thomas. “There are driving scenarios that automatic emergency braking systems are not designed to address.”  Still, Brown’s death illustrates one of the biggest challenges carmakers will face as they work to bring self-driving cars to market. Most car companies envision a gradual path to self-driving capabilities, selling cars with increasingly sophisticated driver-assistance features over several years before ultimately introducing fully self-driving cars with no pedals or steering wheel.  But there’s a danger that people will trust the technology too quickly, as Brown did. After hundreds or even thousands of miles of flawless driving, people could stop paying attention to the road, with deadly consequences. Industry’s answers to what makes driverless cars safer to drive reveal a lot about how we already drive — and how easy it us to become dependent on a new technology.  Partially self-driving cars are going to nag drivers constantly  Tesla’s approach to self-driving — one the company has doubled down on since Brown’s death — is for cars with partial self-driving capabilities to pester drivers to pay attention to the road.  Earlier this month, I visited Tesla’s Palo Alto headquarters for my own test drive of the Model S. Before she let me drive the car on my own, a Tesla employee gave me a lecture where she emphasized that Autopilot is not a full self-driving system. She pointed out that before enabling the Autopilot feature for the first time, drivers must read and accept a disclaimer, displayed on the 17-inch screen in Tesla’s center console, that stresses the need to keep hands on the wheel at all times.  And this isn’t just an idle suggestion. The Model S had sensors that that allowed it to detect if I had my hands on the steering wheel. If I didn’t, the dashboard would eventually begin to flash until I put my hands back on the wheel.  Joshua Brown’s Tesla gave him these warnings too — seven of them — but he didn’t pay enough attention to them. Since his death, Tesla has established a stricter “three strikes and you’re out” rule: If the driver ignores three consecutive warnings, he gets locked out of Autopilot for the rest of that trip. If the driver still doesn’t grab the wheel, the car will assume the driver is incapacitated and come to a gradual stop with the hazard lights flashing.  Other car companies are working on similar technologies. Audi, for example, will soon be introducing a product called traffic jam pilot that will allow hands-free freeway driving up to 35 miles per hour (self-driving at full highway speeds is four to five years away, Audi says). During a recent test drive, Audi engineer Kaushik Raghu told me that Traffic Jam Pilot will include a “driver-availability monitoring system” that makes sure the driver isn’t sleeping or looking backward for an extended period of time.  Cadillac recently announced a freeway-driving technology called Super Cruise that does this. An infrared camera mounted in the steering wheel can tell if the driver is looking out at the road or down at a smartphone. If the driver’s eyes are off the road for too long, the car will start beeping until the driver gets his eyes back on the road.  I got an idea of what this might look like when I visited Nauto, a startup that is developing sophisticated driver-monitoring technology. Nauto makes a windshield-mounted device that looks back at the driver and can tell if the driver isn’t looking at the road. If integrated into a self-driving car — or a conventional car, for that matter — this kind of technology could prevent a lot of distracted driving and highway deaths.  Of course, plenty of people drive regular cars without their hands on the wheel, meaning that driver-assistance cars could ironically wind up asking drivers to pay more attention than their all-human-driven counterparts.  Why almost-perfect autopilot can be dangerous  Chris Urmson, who led the team of Google’s self-driving car engineers until he left to found his own startup last year, describes the decision over whether to assist drivers or take the drivers out of the equation as “one of the big open debates in the space.”  Google — which recently renamed its self-driving car project Waymo — has been thinking about this problem for years. Back in 2014, Google self-driving car engineer Nathaniel Fairfield gave a talk at a computer vision conference describing how Google had built self-driving technology for freeway driving, then decided that the approach was too dangerous. Waymo customers will never be allowed to touch the steering wheel on its cars.  Early versions of Google’s self-driving car technology worked a lot like Tesla’s Autopilot or the Audi prototype I rode in a few weeks ago. The driver would be responsible for navigating surface streets at the beginning and end of a trip, but would be able to activate self-driving mode during freeway driving. Clearly marked roads and a lack of pedestrians and other obstacles make freeway driving a relatively easy computer science problem.  The problem, Fairfield said, was that people started trusting the system too quickly. “People have this curve where they go from somewhat unreasonable but plausible distrust to way, way overconfidence,” Fairfield said. After a few hours of seeing Google’s freeway driving technology in action, people came to have “complete and utter trust” in its efficacy.  “In-car cameras recorded employees climbing into the back seat, climbing out of an open car window, and even smooching while the car was in motion,” John Markoff reported in the New York Times.  A technology that drives perfectly for 100 or even 1,000 miles might still make a catastrophic mistake once in a while. But after mile after mile of flawless driving, it’s unlikely the driver will be paying close attention to the road. Which means that if the car suddenly encounters a problem it can’t handle, handing off control to the human driver could make things worse rather than better.  This is a problem that the aviation industry has grappled with for decades. In 2009, Air France flight 447 crashed into the ocean on the way from Rio de Janeiro to Paris. The problem: ice on the plane’s sensors caused the autopilot to disengage. The pilot, with little experience handling the plane without computer assistance, did exactly the wrong thing, pitching the plane’s nose up when they should have pushed it down. The plane stalled, and the resulting crash killed all 228 people on board.  “It’s clear that automation played a role in this accident, though there is some disagreement about what kind of role it played,” a 2015 Slate article on the crash argues. “Maybe it was a badly designed system that confused the pilots, or maybe years of depending on automation had left the pilots unprepared to take over the controls.”  This is the paradox of automated systems: The better an autopilot system is, the more human beings will come to depend on it and the worse-prepared they’ll be if they’re forced to suddenly take over control.  It’s easy to imagine something similar happening with self-driving cars — especially to younger drivers. As driver assistance technologies become more common, there will be a growing cohort of teenage drivers who have never driven without computer assistance. But if these cars are designed to fall back on a human driver in unexpected situations, there’s a danger that human drivers won’t be prepared, and will do exactly the wrong thing at a life-or-death moment.  And the closer self-driving cars get to full autonomy, the harder it will be to get drivers to pay attention. Even if cars can force drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and their eyes on the road, they might still zone out if they don’t have to actually make any decisions for thousands of miles in a row. Beyond a certain point, it might become safer for the car to just make its best guess about what to do rather than turn over control to a driver who is likely to be disoriented and out of practice.  Waymo wants to jump straight to full self-driving  Google ultimately concluded that partially self-driving cars were a technological dead end. Instead, the company set itself a goal to build a fully self-driving vehicle — one that was so reliable it would never need intervention from a human driver.  Urmson, the former Google engineer, believes that driver assistance and full self-driving are “actually two distinct technologies.”  “In a driver-assistance system, most of the time it’s better to do nothing than to do something,” Urmson said in an April talk. “Only when you’re really, really, really sure that you’re going to prevent a bad event, that’s when you should trigger. That will guide you down a selection of technologies that will limit your ability to bridge over to the other side.”  In contrast, Waymo is trying to build cars that never hand off control to a human passenger. That means the software has to be able to choose a reasonable, safe response to every conceivable situation. And it means building in redundancies so that the car can respond gracefully even if key components fail.  “Each of our self-driving vehicles is equipped with a secondary computer to act as a backup in the rare event that the primary computer goes offline,” Google wrote in a 2016 report. “Its sole responsibility is to monitor the main computer and, if needed, safely pull over or come to a complete stop. It can even account for things like not stopping in the middle of an intersection where it could cause a hazard to other drivers.”  Building software that can gracefully handle any contingency — and redundant, bulletproof hardware — is a much harder technical problem than building driver-assistance technology that counts on humans to handle tricky situations. But it also has a big upside: If the car never transfers control to a human driver, then it never has to worry about the driver being caught unprepared.  For now, Waymo does still have drivers behind the wheel, but these drivers are Waymo employees with special training on handling self-driving vehicles, who are presumably paid to continue paying attention to the road no matter how boring it gets. And in recent months, the job has been getting pretty boring. According to a regulatory filing, Waymo’s self-driving cars drove more than 600,000 miles in California and only had to hand over control to a human driver 124 times.  That works out to one disengagement every 5,000 miles, a four-fold improvement over 2015, and by far the best showing of any company testing on California roads. At that rate of progress, it’ll take a few more years for Waymo to surpass human levels of driving safety. If the California data is any indication, rivals like GM, Ford, BMW, and Mercedes have a lot of catching up to do.  While Waymo seems to be the clear leader in self-driving technology right now, the company is taking a big risk by trying to jump straight to full self-driving technology. Reaching the necessarily level of reliability — going from 99.99 percent reliability to 99.9999 percent, say — might take several more years. During that time, companies taking a gradualist approach could steadily gain ground.  One big advantage of the gradualist approach is that it can allow car companies to collect a lot of data, and many experts believe that having a lot of data is crucial for building successful self-driving cars. Waymo’s cars have driven more than 3 million miles on public road, providing the company with the raw data they use to tune their software algorithms. in contrast, Tesla has collected more than 1 billion miles of real-world sensor data from its customers’ cars. All that extra data could allow Tesla to make more rapid progress toward a goal of full autonomy, allowing it to eventually catch and surpass Waymo’s early lead.  Disclosure: My brother works at Google.  Correction: My article initially said the Air France flight 447 crash was caused by pilots being disoriented in the seconds after the autopilot disengaged. But it’s more accurate to say the crash occurred because they were inexperienced at handling the plane without computer assistance. I’ve modified the article accordingly.

791,2220,10,19,2017,2017-10-19,Fox News,John Kelly 'brokenhearted' by Dem rep's attacks on Trump,"White House Chief of Staff John Kelly said Thursday he was “stunned” and “brokenhearted” after a condolence call President Trump made to the widow of a slain soldier turned into a public and political spectacle pitting the administration against a Democratic lawmaker.  In a rare and emotional moment from the White House briefing room podium, Kelly condemned Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., for listening to that phone call and then criticizing the president's tone in the press.  “I was stunned when I came to work yesterday morning and broken-hearted, at what I saw a member of Congress doing -- a member of Congress who listened in on a phone call from the president"" to the widow, Kelly told reporters.  “It stuns me that a member of Congress would have listened in on that conversation, absolutely stuns me. … I thought at least that was sacred,” he said, blasting what he called Wilson's ""selfish behavior.""  Kelly, whose son Second Lt. Robert Kelly was killed in battle in Afghanistan in 2010, said he was so shocked by the escalation of events that he went to Arlington National Cemetery to take a walk.  The Trump call in question was made to the widow of Army Sgt. La David Johnson, one of four Americans killed in an ambush in Niger on Oct. 4.  Wilson within hours went to the press to criticize Trump for allegedly saying during that phone call that ""he knew what he signed up for,"" claiming the remarks were insensitive.  Trump denied it, while Wilson stood by her account.  Kelly on Thursday seemed to back up part of Wilson's account, but sought to put the president's words in the proper context -- while blasting Wilson for listening to the conversation at all.  Kelly said Trump was trying to say something akin to what Gen. Joseph Dunford, now chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told him when his own son died: That ""he was doing exactly what he wanted to do … he knew what he was getting into.""  Soon after Kelly's remarks, Wilson responded.  ""Let me tell you what my mother told me when I was little. She said 'The dog can bark at the moon all night long, but it doesn’t become an issue until the moon barks back,'"" Wilson told reporters.  Trump ignited a political controversy over how presidents interact with Gold Star families earlier this week after he questioned whether former President Barack Obama called the families of fallen troops during his eight years in office. This was as he faced questions about his administration's response to the Niger ambush.  Obama did call and write letters to families of some fallen soldiers, though Kelly said Thursday that Obama did not call him when his son died. However, he stressed that he did not say that as a ""criticism"" of Obama.  When Trump called Johnson's widow 12 days after the attack, Wilson later spoke to the media and criticized his choice of words.  Kelly told reporters Thursday that he advised Trump what to say to the families of the soldiers who had died in battle. Initially, Kelly said he instructed the president not to make the phone call.",29.0,28.0
140,843,9,13,2017,2017-09-13,The New York Times,"After Irma, a Grim Sense of Déjà Vu in St. Augustine"," This place calls itself the “Ancient City,” and, by the standards of American cities, that’s about right. St. Augustine is 452 years old, having been founded by the Spanish conquistador Don Pedro Menéndez de Avilés in 1565.  But residents are reckoning with a stunning turn in its more recent history. Last October, Hurricane Matthew poured historic flooding into St. Augustine, inundating downtown, where Spanish colonial-style buildings and Gilded-age spires gleam over the bay, and leaving residents ripping out walls and replacing sodden furniture. Now, the city is cleaning up after Hurricane Irma, which whipped trees out of the ground and poured more water into homes and businesses that were just getting back to normal after Matthew.  St. Augustine is no stranger to sunny-day flooding, but the back-to-back hits from Matthew and Irma were the first major hurricanes to descend here since Dora in the 1960s, and they have left residents soaked, frustrated and, in some cases, worried about the future.  “It is the oldest continuously occupied city in America. It is how we started,” Mayor Nancy Shaver said.  But, she said, “I’ve never had people ask me the questions they’re asking me now: Is this the new normal?

Additionally, the study found that stations owned by Sinclair Broadcasting Group were much less likely than other stations to report on the proposal at all.    Sarah Wasko / Media Matters    Maine voters will have an opportunity to vote to expand Medicaid  AP: On Election Day, Maine voters will decide whether to expand Medicaid in their state via a ballot initiative. Voters in Maine will decide on this Election Day “whether to join 31 other states and expand Medicaid under former President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act,” The Associated Press (AP) reported. As AP noted, “It is the first time since the law took effect nearly four years ago that the expansion question has been put to voters.” From the October 31 article:  On Nov. 7, voters in Maine will decide whether to join 31 other states and expand Medicaid under former President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. It is the first time since the law took effect nearly four years ago that the expansion question has been put to voters. The ballot measure comes after Maine’s Republican governor vetoed five attempts by the politically divided Legislature to expand the program and take advantage of the federal government picking up most of the cost. [The Associated Press, 10/31/17]  Local TV in Maine omitted information about the key benefits of expansion from their reports  Media Matters analyzed eight months of local news reporting on the ballot initiative to expand Medicaid. A Media Matters analysis found that, in total, local TV news networks in Portland, ME, covered the initiative in 49 segments between February 21, when the initiative was approved, and October 21. Those segments routinely omitted important information about the benefits of expanding Medicaid in Maine:  CBPP: Expanding Medicaid “would provide Medicaid coverage to more than 70,000 low-income Mainers.” The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) estimated that expanding Medicaid in Maine “would provide Medicaid coverage to more than 70,000 low-income Mainers.” [Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 10/25/17]  Only about 30 percent of local news segments in Portland, ME, mentioned potential coverage gains under Medicaid expansion. A Media Matters analysis of local TV coverage of the Medicaid expansion initiative in Portland, ME, found that of 49 segments that discussed the policy over the course of eight months, only 15 segments -- or 30.6 percent -- mentioned the potential coverage gains for citizens if Maine expanded Medicaid.  CBPP: In states that expanded Medicaid, “nearly 1.7 million rural Americans have gained coverage through the Medicaid expansion.” “Nearly 1.7 million rural Americans have gained coverage through the Medicaid expansion,” according to CBPP. The center also explained that in states that expanded Medicaid, “rural residents make up a larger share of expansion enrollees than of the states’ combined populations.” [Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 6/23/17]  No segments discussed potential coverage gains by rural Mainers. Of the 49 segments, none mentioned potential coverage gains for those who live in rural parts of Maine.  Council of Economic Advisers: Residents in states that expanded Medicaid are more likely to say they are in good or excellent health than residents in other states. A 2014 analysis by then-President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers found that “having insurance coverage improves overall health.” By expanding Medicaid in the 24 states that had not yet done so at that point, the report estimated, “757,000 additional people would report being in excellent, very good, or good health.” The report also found that “states that have already expanded Medicaid will achieve this outcome for 575,000 people.” [The Council of Economic Advisers, 7/2/14]  Only one segment mentioned the overall health benefits of expanding Medicaid. Of the 49 total segments, only one -- or 2.0 percent -- mentioned the potential health benefits that correlate with expanding Medicaid.  CBPP: Expanding Medicaid has “substantially improved rural hospitals’ finances.” CBPP found that expanding Medicaid has “substantially improved rural hospitals’ finances,” partially because “the Medicaid expansion significantly reduced rural hospitals’ uncompensated care costs.” Additionally, CBPP stated that expanding Medicaid has “improved all hospitals’ operating margins” and “excess margins … but the effect was particularly pronounced in rural areas.” From the CBPP report (citations removed):  Health coverage gains in states that expanded Medicaid to low-income adults have substantially improved rural hospitals’ finances. First, the Medicaid expansion significantly reduced rural hospitals’ uncompensated care costs — services for which hospitals are not reimbursed by an insurer or the patient. Between 2013 and 2015, rural hospitals’ uncompensated care costs fell 43 percent in Medicaid expansion states, compared to 16 percent in non-expansion states. Uncompensated care costs among rural hospitals declined as a share of total costs from 5.3 percent to 3.2 percent in expansion states, while only declining from 6.8 percent to 6.1 percent in non-expansion states. Uncompensated care costs have been shown to strain hospital budgets, reduce profit margins, and contribute to hospital closings. The Medicaid expansion also significantly increased Medicaid revenue among rural hospitals. Since 2013, Medicaid revenue as a share of total hospital revenue rose by 33 percent in rural hospitals in expansion states, compared to just 1.1 percent among rural hospitals in non-expansion states. That 33 percent increase equates to $2 million in higher annual revenue to the average rural hospital due to the Medicaid expansion. The Medicaid expansion improved all hospitals’ operating margins (i.e., the difference between their revenue from providing services to patients and their total operating expenses) and excess margins (the difference between revenue from all sources, including donations, parking fees, vending machines, etc., and total operating expenses), but the effect was particularly pronounced in rural areas. Rural hospitals in expansion states increased their operating margins by 4.0 percentage points more, and their excess margins by 2.3 percentage points more, than rural hospitals in non-expansion states. Gains were particularly pronounced among small rural hospitals with fewer than 100 beds in expansion states, where operating margins rose by 4.5 percent. The Medicaid expansion led to smaller gains in operating and excess margins in urban areas, of 1.0 percentage points and 0.9 percentage points, respectively. [Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 6/23/17]  Only three segments mentioned the potential financial benefits for rural hospitals. Of the 49 total segments, only three -- or 6.1 percent -- mentioned the financial benefits for rural hospitals in states that expanded Medicaid.  Families USA: Expanding Medicaid leads to “higher educational attainment” for children. In a blog post, Families USA summarized a report finding that expanding Medicaid allows children “to reap the benefits associated with health coverage,” which go beyond health care and include “higher educational attainment and greater economic opportunities for children, and the creation of a more skilled workforce.” From the July 8, 2014, blog post:  The expansion of Medicaid gives parents options for affordable health coverage. When more parents enroll in health insurance, so do their kids, allowing them to reap the benefits associated with health coverage. These benefits extend beyond access to health care, as the Cornell and Harvard researchers note in their study: “[T]he long-run returns to providing health insurance access to children are larger than just the…gains in health status.” Those returns include higher educational attainment and greater economic opportunities for children, and the creation of a more skilled workforce. With these findings, it should be clear to policymakers that not only does expanding Medicaid close the coverage gap – it also increases the payback on their education investment. [Families USA, 7/8/14]  No segments mentioned the educational benefits for children of expanding Medicaid. Of the 49 total segments, none mentioned the educational benefits for children in states that expanded Medicaid.  Robert Woods Johnson Foundation: States that expanded Medicaid “report financial benefits through savings and revenue gains.” “As a result of Medicaid expansion, states continue to report financial benefits through savings and revenue gains,” a study by the Robert Woods Johnson Foundation found. As the report explained, the saving and revenue “can be used to finance other state spending priorities or to offset much, if not all, of the state costs of expansion.” [Robert Woods Johnson Foundation, March 2016]  Only three segments discussed the budgetary benefits for states that expanded Medicaid. Of the 49 total segments, only three -- or 6.1 percent -- mentioned budgetary benefits states received after expanding Medicaid.  KFF: “Research suggests that Medicaid expansion improves the affordability of care and financial security among the low-income population.” The Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) summarized research that “suggests that Medicaid expansion improves the affordability of care and financial security among the low-income population.” Among the studies, KFF noted, several found “expansion states have experienced greater reductions in unmet medical need because of cost than non-expansion states.” Additionally, “multiple studies found larger declines in trouble paying medical bills in expansion states relative to non-expansion states.” [Kaiser Family Foundation, 6/20/16]  No segments mentioned increased financial security for low-income people in states that expanded Medicaid. Of the 49 total segments, none mentioned the increased affordability of care and financial security low-income people found in states that expanded Medicaid.  NY Times: Expanding Medicaid “could lower insurance prices for everyone else.” The New York Times’ Margot Sanger-Katz summarized a study by the Department of Health and Human Services which found “insurance in the marketplace for middle-income people cost less in the places that had expanded Medicaid” in 2015. From the August 25, 2016, article:  The Obama administration for years has been pleading with states to expand their Medicaid programs and offer health coverage to low-income people. Now it has a further argument in its favor: Expansion of Medicaid could lower insurance prices for everyone else. A new study published by in-house researchers at the Department of Health and Human Services compared places that have expanded their Medicaid programs as part of Obamacare with neighboring places that have not. They found that, in 2015, insurance in the marketplace for middle-income people cost less in the places that had expanded Medicaid. By comparing counties across state borders, and adjusting for several differences between them, the researchers calculated that expanding Medicaid meant marketplace premiums that were 7 percent lower. [The New York Times, 8/25/16]  No segments mentioned the correlation between Medicaid expansion and lower premiums. Of the 49 total segments, none mentioned the correlation between states that expanded Medicaid and states that had lower premiums.  State Health Reform Assistance Network: States that expanded Medicaid have the “greatest opportunity” to address opioid addiction. “Medicaid is the most powerful vehicle available to states to fund coverage of prevention and treatment for their residents at risk for or actively battling opioid addiction,” according to a report by the State Health Reform Assistance Network, a project of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. From the July 2016 report:  States are grappling day to day with the vast and deadly public health crisis. Medicaid is the most powerful vehicle available to states to fund coverage of prevention and treatment for their residents at risk for or actively battling opioid addiction. Through federal flexibility, states can create strategies that meet their specific needs, designed to augment other efforts underway. The greatest opportunity to address this crisis is in those states that have elected to expand Medicaid, given the greater reach of the program, additional tools available, and the increased availability of federal funds. [State Health Reform Assistance Network, July 2016]  No segments mentioned the impact expanding Medicaid has on opioid addiction. Of the 49 total segments, none mentioned the impact Medicaid expansion has on addiction treatment for opioid use.  GAO: Medicaid expansion enrollees in three states “could more easily access treatment” for mental or behavioral health issues than when uninsured. A report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that in Iowa, Washington, and West Virginia, “compared to being uninsured, expansion enrollees could more easily access treatment, such as community-based mental health services and behavioral health prescription drugs.” [United States Government Accountability Office, June 2017]  No segments mentioned the impact of expanding Medicaid on mental and behavioral health treatment. Of the 49 total segments, none mentioned the impact of Medicaid expansion on mental health treatment.  Sinclair stations were less likely to cover the Medicaid expansion ballot initiative than other networks    Sarah Wasko / Media Matters    Sinclair-owned networks aired only eight segments about the potential Medicaid expansion over the course of eight months. Over the eight-month study period, the two Sinclair-owned stations in Portland, ME, CBS affiliate WGME and Fox Broadcasting Co. affiliate WPFO, aired merely eight segments discussing the initiative to expand Medicaid in Maine. In contrast, the two stations not owned by Sinclair, ABC affiliate WMTW and NBC affiliate WCSH, aired 30 segments and 11 segments on the topic, respectively. [Portland Press Herald, 7/30/17]  Methodology  Media Matters searched iQ media for mentions of “Medicaid” and all iterations of the word “expand” on the ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox Broadcasting Co. affiliates in Portland, ME. We included segments in this study that occurred between February 21, when the ballot initiative was approved, and October 21. We included segments where the stated topic of discussion was the Medicaid expansion and then coded for the following topics:  how expanding Medicaid would provide coverage for people in Maine;  the impact of expanding Medicaid on rural Americans;  the health benefits of expanding Medicaid;  the impact of Medicaid expansion on rural hospitals;  the educational benefits of expanding Medicaid;  the benefits of expanding Medicaid on state budgets;  the impact expanding Medicaid has on the financial security of low-income Americans;  the effects of expanding Medicaid on premiums;  the impact of Medicaid expansion on addiction treatment; and  the impact of Medicaid expansion on mental health treatment.

But in almost all species, the poison frog carries tadpoles on its back to a rain forest pool for their final growth stage.  One species, Allobates femoralis, may or may not be mildly poisonous, and for color it has a splash of orange on its thighs. Thus its endearing common name, the brilliant-thighed poison frog. And sure enough, the females lay the eggs in a relatively dry spot in the rain forest, and once the embryos reach tadpole stage, the males load them on their backs and take off.  Andrius Pasukonis, a researcher associated with the University of Vienna and Harvard University, has been studying these frogs in the rain forest of French Guiana to learn how the males find the pools and what triggers this complicated act of tadpole transport. He and Kristina Beck, a graduate student at the University of Vienna, and others, determined in one project that the frogs don’t search for pools but return directly to pools they know.  “They really rely on their spatial memory; they don’t randomly wander around the forest until they bump into pools,” Dr. Pasukonis said.

Bush and Jimmy Carter place their hands on their chest for the national anthem on stage at the opening of a hurricanes relief concert in College Station, Texas, Saturday, Oct. 21, 2017. All five living former U.S. presidents joined to support a Texas concert raising money for relief efforts from Hurricane Harvey, Irma and Maria's devastation in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. (AP Photo/LM Otero)  AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — The five living former presidents put aside politics and appeared together for the first time since 2013 at a concert on Saturday to raise money for victims of devastating hurricanes in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  Democrats Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter and Republicans George H.W. and George W. Bush gathered in College Station, Texas, home of Texas A&M University, to try to unite the country after the storms.  Texas A&M is home to the presidential library of the elder Bush. At 93, he has a form of Parkinson’s disease and appeared in a wheelchair at the event. His wife, Barbara, and George W. Bush’s wife, Laura, were in the audience.  Grammy award winner Lady Gaga made a surprise appearance at the concert that also featured country music band Alabama, Rock & Roll Hall of Famer ‘Soul Man’ Sam Moore, gospel legend Yolanda Adams and Texas musicians Lyle Lovett and Robert Earl Keen.  The appeal backed by the ex-presidents has raised $31 million since it began on Sept. 7, said Jim McGrath, spokesman for George H.W. Bush.  President Donald Trump offered a video greeting that avoided his past criticism of the former presidents and called them “some of America’s finest public servants.”  “This wonderful effort reminds us that we truly are one nation under God, all unified by our values and devotion to one another,” Trump said in the greeting, played during the concert.  Four of the five former presidents — Obama, George W. Bush, Carter and Clinton — made brief remarks that did not mention Trump. The elder Bush did not speak but smiled and waved to the crowd. They appealed for national unity to help those hurt by the hurricanes.  “The heart of America, without regard to race or religion or political party, is greater than our problems,” said Clinton.  The last time the five were together was in 2013, when Obama was still in office, at the dedication of George W. Bush’s presidential library in Dallas.  There is precedent for former presidents joining forces for post-disaster fundraising. George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton raised money together after the 2004 South Asia tsunami and Hurricane Katrina the next year. Clinton and George W. Bush combined to seek donations after Haiti’s 2011 earthquake.  “It’s certainly a triple, if not a home run, every time,” said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor at the University of Houston. “Presidents have the most powerful and prolific fundraising base of any politician in the world. When they send out a call for help, especially on something that’s not political, they can rake in big money.”  Amid criticism that his administration was initially slow to aid ravaged Puerto Rico, Trump accused island leaders of “poor leadership,” and later tweeted that, “Electric and all infrastructure was disaster before hurricanes” while saying that Federal Emergency Management Agency, first-responders and military personnel wouldn’t be able to stay there forever.  But Rottinghaus said ex-presidents are seen as less polarizing than the current president.  “They can’t get away from the politics of the moment,” he said of current White House occupants. “Ex-presidents are able to step back and be seen as the nation’s grandfather.”  Hurricane Harvey slammed into Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast as a Category 4 hurricane on Aug. 25, unleashing historic flooding in Houston and killing more than 80 people. Shortly thereafter, all five ex-presidents appeared in a commercial for a fundraising effort known as “One America Appeal.” In it, George W. Bush says, “People are hurting down here.” His father, George H.W. Bush, then replies, “We love you, Texas.”  Hurricane Irma subsequently hit Florida and Hurricane Maria battered Puerto Rico, while both devastated the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The report by the Government Accountability Office, Congress’s auditing arm, urges the Trump administration to take climate change risks seriously and begin formulating a response.  The study, scheduled to be released Tuesday, says that different sectors of the economy and different parts of the country will be harmed in ways that are difficult to predict. But one estimate projects that rising temperatures could cause losses in labor productivity of as much as $150 billion by 2099, while changes in some crop yields could cost as much as $53 billion. The Southwest will suffer more costly wildfires, the Southeast will see more heat-related deaths and the Northwest must prepare for diminished shellfish harvests.  The report acknowledges that it is difficult to pinpoint the costs of disasters that can be directly attributed to climate change. And the projected fiscal burden remains less than 1 percent of the current $3.8 trillion federal budget.",19.0,12.0

On its face, the statute permits using force only against those responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. But three presidents, from both major parties, have stretched it to cover enemies beyond the original Al Qaeda and its Taliban host in Afghanistan.  And broader questions about the legal scope and limits of presidential warmaking powers have taken on new urgency in the Trump era, including because of tensions with North Korea over its testing of nuclear weapons and longer-range missiles and the deaths of four American soldiers this month in Niger.  Questioned about North Korea on Monday, Mr. Tillerson and Mr. Mattis acknowledged that Congress had not granted any authority to Mr. Trump to start a war. Still, they said, he possessed constitutional authority as commander in chief to strike North Korea in the event of an imminent attack against the United States.  But Mr. Tillerson demurred when pressed to say whether North Korea’s mere possession of a nuclear weapon that could reach the United States would be sufficient to enable Mr. Trump to strike on his own. Mr. Tillerson said such questions could turn on the facts, including whether such a weapon was stored in a bunker or was sitting on a launching pad.  Several senators also pressed the witnesses about the recent deaths in Niger. Although Mr. Mattis said the purpose of the deployment there was to help build up national defenses because “the enemy is trying to move somewhere” as the Islamic State’s stronghold in Iraq and Syria collapsed, he said it was authorized under a separate law that allowed the military to carry out training and assistance missions.",41.0,38.0
161,958,6,1,2017,2017-06-01,Vox,LeBron James means a lot to Cleveland — and its economy,"LeBron James, the most dominant basketball player of his generation and perhaps the game’s most gifted creator on the court, is also a historic force at creating ... jobs.  That’s right. Wherever the three-time NBA champion goes, businesses and jobs follow. Some economists with the American Enterprise Institute quantified his impact in new research published last month.  One of the allures of professional sports is ostensibly the economic benefits for their home cities. Team owners, though usually billionaires themselves, often make that case when they ask local taxpayers to pony up hundreds of millions or billions of dollars to fund new stadiums and arenas.  Some researchers have argued that new sports facilities don’t have any economic upside — and might actually have a negative influence. Roger Noll of Stanford University and Andrew Zimbalist of Smith College devoted much of their book on sports economics to that issue.  But a generational talent and cultural phenom like James? In the downtowns where he plies his trade, the economic benefits he brings are very real, according to research by Daniel Shoag and Stan Veuger, who wrote their analysis for AEI.  (This is where I should disclose, I suppose, that I grew up 90 minutes south of Cleveland and have rooted for James and the Cavaliers since he came into the league in 2003. James and the Cavs, defending NBA champions, face the Golden State Warriors for the third consecutive NBA Finals, starting tonight.)  Shoag and Veuger place their analysis in that broader context of whether sports actually benefit their local economies, as well as building on recent research that superstars do increase attendance at sporting events. James’s career also provides a tidy economic experiment, because he spent his first seven years in Cleveland, left for Miami for four years, and then returned to Cleveland in 2014.  Here is how they summarize their findings:  “We find that Mr. James has a statistically and economically significant positive effect on both the number of restaurants and other eating and drinking establishments near the stadium where he is based, and on aggregate employment at those establishments.”  Specifically, James’s presence increased the number of restaurants and bars within one mile of his team’s arena by 13 percent, they found, and increased employment at those establishments by 23.5 percent.  The effects were felt most strongly within one mile of the arena, started to dissipate but were still present within seven miles, and then disappeared completely. So the LeBron effect is real, but it is fairly limited to the areas near where he plays basketball. The outreaches of the Cleveland and Miami metropolitan area did not see much of a benefit.  James giveth and taketh away — and not only for fans, who (I can attest) were ecstatic when he came, distraught when he left, and overjoyed when he returned.  Look at these two charts, showing the number of eating and drinking joints within one mile of the Cleveland and Miami arenas. Remember, James was in Cleveland from 2006 to 2010, then in Miami from 2010 to 2014, and back in Cleveland from 2014 to now.  The dots tell the tale. The number of establishments near Cleveland’s Quicken Loans Arena fell from more than 190 during James’s first tenure, to less than 170 after he left, and then spiked to more than 210 upon his return. In Miami, the number of bars and restaurants near American Airlines Arena steadily increased while James was there, hitting a high of 250-plus, before falling off slightly after James returned to Cleveland.  Of course, while the pattern is clear, James can’t take all the credit — he doesn’t dominate a local economy in the same way he dominates a basketball game. Shoag and Veuger did their best to isolate the LeBron effect and concluded his specific influence was felt far more in Cleveland than in Miami.  “Two potential explanations come to mind. Perhaps Mr. James is particularly beloved in his native Ohio,” they wrote. “Or maybe ‘superstar amenities’ are substitutes, not complements, and Miami has plenty of them even without Mr. James, generating fiercer competition and an attenuated impact of any specific superstar.”  I’m going with the first one.",4.0,7.0
275,1601,10,4,2017,2017-10-04,The New York Times,Hurricane Damage in Puerto Rico Leads to Fears of Drug Shortages Nationwide,"Dr. Gottlieb, who visited F.D.A. staff in Puerto Rico last week, told the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s subcommittee on Health: “We have a list of about 40 drugs that we’re very concerned about. It reflects maybe about 10 firms.”  Thirteen of the drugs, Dr. Gottlieb said, are “sole-source,” meaning the product is made only by one company. Those include H.I.V. medications, injectable drugs and sophisticated medical devices, although he did not name the products. The biggest problem, he said, was not damage to the factories, but the instability of the electric supply. Manufacturers are worried that a long-term lack of connection to a major power grid could jeopardize their products, and are also wary of relying on the more limited electrical grids that the territory is likely to activate as a first step to restoring power.  One of the drugs F.D.A. officials said they were concerned about was methotrexate, which treats childhood leukemia and other diseases. It has been scarce, off and on, for several years. Mylan makes the product in Puerto Rico, and all five manufacturers of the injectable form of the drug have reported shortages of the product, according to a list maintained by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists.  In a statement, Mylan did not address the methotrexate shortage but said it was “working closely with F.D.A. to help address drug shortage concerns.” Its plant has sources of water, electricity and communication, and the company said it is “working on ways to make them sustainable for manufacturing purposes.” Like other companies, it said it was focusing on helping employees and other residents of the island with basic needs, including chartering a cargo plane carrying essential goods to deliver to them.  Several pharmaceutical and medical device companies said that their factories were coming back on line with the assistance of generators and that they did not anticipate supply shortfalls. But others said the situation was precarious. Drug companies depend on consistent refrigeration to avoid shortages. And device makers are wondering when the power grid would be back up, which some officials have predicted could take months.",1.0,2.0

Trump also promised he would make every effort to “Drain the swamp” in Washington DC. No one could have imagined the effect his words would have on voters as they continue to go to the polls to remove Democrat legislators who are not on board with the Make America Great Again agenda and to punish RINO’s (Republicans In Name Only) who have consistently stood against the wishes of Republican voters. If the voters give Arizona Senator Jeff Flake a big “thumbs down” in the August primary, it could be the biggest prize so far for. Flake is up against Dr. Kelli Ward, a very tough, conservative opponent who is also backed by President Trump. Based on the current polls, Flake should be concerned, and Americans who are serious about draining the swamp should be celebrating.  Watch President Trump hammer Senator McCain and the “weak” Senator Flake at an Arizona rally, where he also threw his support behind Dr. Kelli Ward:  Trending: AMERICA’S BIGGEST LOSER Explains Why Multiple Sexual Assault Claims Against Bill Clinton Are Not As Serious As Kavanaugh’s…Calls For CIVIL WAR!

Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court? Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?  Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court? * Yes, he will be confirmed. No, he will not be confirmed.  Email *  Phone      After bucking Donald Trump in a state the president won, Flake is bottoming out in polls. Yet Republicans look like they may be stuck with a hard-core conservative challenger who some fear could win the primary but lose in the general election.  A White House search for a candidate to replace former state Sen. Kelli Ward in the primary appears to have hit a wall. And now conservatives want to turn Arizona into the latest example of a Trump Train outsider taking down a member of the GOP establishment.  “People are fooling themselves if they think Jeff Flake is anything but a walking dead member of the United State Senate,” said Andy Surabian, whose Great America Alliance is backing Ward.  “I don’t see how he survives a primary. I don’t see how he survives a general. The numbers just don’t add up,” added Surabian, who worked at the White House as an adviser to Steve Bannon, then the president’s top strategist.  Despite discontent among some Republicans over Ward, Bannon met with her last week at a conservative conference in Colorado Springs to encourage her campaign, according to a Republican official who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose the previously unreported private meeting.  Ward unsuccessfully challenged Arizona’s senior senator, John McCain, in last year’s election, losing in the primary by a wide margin. But in Flake, she would face a more vulnerable candidate at a moment when the GOP establishment is on the defensive, facing a simmering anti-incumbent mood heightened by Republicans’ failure to make good on seven years of promises to scrap Barack Obama’s health care law.  Flake is in danger of becoming the latest victim of this voter wrath. Yet rather than making an effort to soothe pro-Trump GOP voters, he’s all but dared them to take him down by kicking off his campaign with an anti-Trump manifesto, “Conscience of a Conservative,” a book in which he bemoaned his party’s failure to stand up to Trump in last year’s presidential race.  “We pretended that the emperor wasn’t naked,” Flake wrote.  Trump, in turn, has lashed out at Flake on Twitter, calling him “toxic,” while praising Ward. White House officials say there’s little chance Trump will have a change of heart over supporting Flake. One official, speaking on condition of anonymity to disclose private deliberations, said Trump is irritated not only by Flake’s public criticism but by what Trump sees as the senator’s attempts to use his critiques of the president to gain attention.  Nevertheless, Flake, 54, insists he won’t be getting out of the race. The primary is Aug. 29.",8.0,10.0
0,60,8,30,2017,2017-08-30,Fox News,Tax reform now -- failure to act could mean minority status for GOP in 2019,"Republicans in Congress are at a make or break moment and everyone knows it. Moments like these don’t come around very often in politics. President Donald Trump, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell all agree that the time has come to seize on real and lasting tax reform, which will lead to job creation and fuel our economic engine for future generations. Republicans, as well as any Trump-state Democrats seeking to help hardworking American taxpayers with this pro-growth legislation, need to come together. We must get a robust tax reform bill signed into law this year.  The American people know that Republicans control the White House and both Houses of Congress, and looking at the first six months of the 115th Congress have little to show for it. If Congress doesn’t act, it will appear that the campaign rhetoric was just that – all talk. We have a President of the United States asking Congress to send a tax reform package to his desk. Year after year during the Obama Administration, Republican leaders in Congress said “just wait until we have a Republican president. Then things will be different.” McConnell and Ryan must produce a historic tax reform package that members of their respective caucuses can get behind. Inaction on tax reform could very well mean minority status in 2019. Make no mistake about it; the American people expect action. It’s true that Democrats are being obstructionists, but folks around the country want Republicans to get the job done and keep their promise.  When overly burdensome taxes and regulations are cut for American entrepreneurs, American businesses, and American workers, amazing things happen.  The American people believe all Republicans are in agreement that tax reform is critical. That’s why American families and job creators want to know when it’s going to happen and so does President Trump. Republicans on Capitol Hill from across the political spectrum, from the most moderate to the most conservative, all acknowledge that tax reform and tax relief were key campaign promises in 2016 that helped catapult them to victory and majority status in both chambers of Congress.  Republicans also agree on the importance of tax reform and tax cuts when it comes to growing the economy. President Trump’s uplifting economic message paved the way for his victories in states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Upon taking office, the President’s economic optimism and executive orders on deregulation have caused the Dow Jones industrial average to skyrocket to historic highs, paved the way to one million new jobs created in six months and 2.6 percent growth in the second quarter, and made the unemployment rate shrink to its lowest level since 2001. But job creators in businesses large and small are expecting tax reform from Congress in 2017 so they can plan for the future.  When President Ronald Reagan’s economic recovery act was signed into law in 1981, it created decades of unprecedented economic growth. It’s a recent roadmap to success that must be learned from. When overly burdensome taxes and regulations are cut for American entrepreneurs, American businesses, and American workers, amazing things happen. It’s called American Exceptionalism and President Reagan knew that better than anyone. Republican Senators from Ted Cruz and Mike Lee to Susan Collins and John McCain know that too. It’s time for these leaders to come together and deliver on much-deserved tax reform and tax relief.  Failure is not an option. The economy is on the launch pad ready to fire its engines at full capacity. America just needs the tax package signed into law to achieve historic levels of growth. Job creators are waiting for Congress to press the ignition button. It’s time for them to act.",1.0,1.0

As a result, the stretch of eastern and central Pennsylvania that includes the Lehigh Valley has grown faster than any other market in the country over the last five years, according to CBRE. While retailers tend to bulk up their facilities with temporary helpers around the holidays — Amazon has announced plans to hire 120,000 seasonal employees by the end of the year — they have also taken on an army of full-time workers. Warehouse employment in a two-county area that includes Bethlehem jumped to 15,200 in 2017, from 5,200 in 2010.  “I don’t know of another place in the world that has gone from a submarket to a global hub in eight years,” said David Egan, the global head of industrial and logistics research at CBRE. “It’s undeniable that it is a key, crucial market for global trade.”  Some of the biggest players in the warehouse game have staked a claim to Lehigh Valley land.

Meanwhile, the president finally made good on his promise to declare a public health emergency over the opioid crisis, and the media world became the subject of its own story, as long-whispered tales of sexual misconduct by influential men in the industry became the subject of on-the-record accusations with heads finally starting to roll.  Here’s what you need to know.  Congressional Republicans passed a budget  A budget resolution that passed the Senate last week was adopted verbatim by House Republicans on Thursday. This has mostly been covered in terms of its procedural impact on the possibility of passing tax cuts later but it’s also an important statement of Republican Party policy priorities.  What the budget says: The budget calls for tax cuts that would add $1.5 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years, offset by about $1.8 trillion in cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and other health care programs.  What the budget does: In terms of practical impact, the budget lets a tax cut bill that adheres to the $1.5 trillion figure pass the Senate with 50 votes, depriving Democrats of the opportunity to filibuster. The health care cuts lack such so-called “reconciliation instructions” so Republicans won’t be able to pass them without Democratic help, which they won’t get.  What’s next? In practical terms, now Republicans need an actual tax bill. In symbolic terms it’s a reminder that even as Trump has established personal mastery over the institutional Republican Party, in policy terms he now hews much closer to orthodox budget-cutting conservatism than he did as a candidate.  More sexual harassment shoes dropped  In the wake of the New York Times’ exposé on sexual assault and harassment by film producer Harvey Weinstein, a wave of accusations is now rocking the journalism industry itself — including Vox Media, whose editorial director Lockhart Steele was fired last week — claiming a number of prominent scalps with more major revelations sure to come.  It started at Fox: The Weinstein stories appear to have unleashed the floodgates of formal sexual misconduct allegations, but the deeper roots of the story lie in Gretchen Carlson’s exposure of Fox News founder Roger Ailes, which has spiraled into revelations of serious misconduct by at least five high-profile men at the company.  Heads are starting to roll: The difference, lately, is that accusations are delivering results. Steele was fired, Leon Wieseltier’s forthcoming magazine was canceled after women he’d worked with at the New Republic came forward with stories of serious misconduct, and publication of Mark Halperin’s latest book has been canceled after CNN reported on accusations of misconduct leveled by several women.  There’s more to come: Tangible results are inspiring more women to consider coming forward with their stories, and more journalists to take victims seriously and pursue stories. Media reporters are getting tips, and former New York Times editor Jill Abramson says she's in pursuit of a big story.  Retiring Republicans blasted Trump  Trump has rarely had a week untroubled by intra-party conflict, but things reached a new pitch on Tuesday, which started with a Twitter war between the president and Bob Corker (R-TN) and ended with Jeff Flake (R-AZ) offering a blistering denunciation of the president from the senate floor.  What happened? Corker, who announced his retirement recently, has been repeatedly at odds with the White House, slamming the president’s immaturity in various ways and taking grief in return. Flake, whose approval rating had been nosediving in his home state and looked to be on track to lose a primary, announced his retirement and said he “will not be complicit” in the ongoing “corruption of the spirit” that he sees emanating from the White House.  Why it matters: In the short-term, two off-the-reservation senators are a potential problem for the GOP legislative agenda — especially if Flake or Corker insist on opposing a tax bill that increases the deficit. In the longer term, Republicans will be favored to hold both seats after the 2018 midterms, just moving Trumpier figures into place.  What’s next? Potentially something big. But also potentially nothing. After the dramatic Tuesday, both Flake and Corker voted in lockstep with their Republican colleagues on a bank deregulation bill and neither have announced any legislative or oversight initiatives to back up their stated concerns.  Opioid abuse is officially an emergency  On Thursday, Trump somewhat belated officially accepted a key recommendation of his own opioid commission and declared a public health emergency around the opioid abuse epidemic. It’s a dramatic sounding move whose actual impact, though real, is rather limited.",4.0,14.0

115,691,9,11,2017,2017-09-11,Fox News,"Apple may test the bounds of iPhone love with a $1,000 model","Apple is expected to sell its fanciest iPhone yet for $1,000, crossing into a new financial frontier that will test how much consumers are willing to pay for a device that's become an indispensable part of modern life.  The unveiling of a dramatically redesigned iPhone will likely be the marquee moment Tuesday when Apple hosts its first product event at its new spaceship-like headquarters in Cupertino, California. True to its secretive ways, Apple won't confirm that it will be introducing a new iPhone, though a financial forecast issued last month telegraphed something significant is in the pipeline.  In addition to several new features, a souped-up ""anniversary"" iPhone — coming a decade after Apple's late co-founder Steve Jobs unveiled the first version — could also debut at an attention-getting $999 price tag, twice what the original iPhone cost. It would set a new price threshold for any smartphone intended to appeal to a mass market.  WHAT A THOUSAND BUCKS WILL BUY  Various leaks have indicated the new phone will feature a sharper display, a so-called OLED screen that will extend from edge to edge of the device, thus eliminating the exterior gap, or ""bezel,"" that currently surrounds most phone screens.  It may also boast facial recognition technology for unlocking the phone and wireless charging. A better camera is a safe bet, too.  All those features have been available on other smartphones that sold for less than $1,000, but Apple's sense of design and marketing flair has a way of making them seem irresistible — and worth the extra expense.  ""Apple always seems to take what others have done and do it even better,"" said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with Creative Strategies.  WHY PHONES COST MORE, NOT LESS  Apple isn't the only company driving up smartphone prices. Market leader Samsung Electronics just rolled out its Galaxy Note 8 with a starting price of $930.  The trend reflects the increasing sophistication of smartphones, which have been evolving into status symbols akin to automobiles. In both cases, many consumers appear willing to pay a premium price for luxury models that take them where they want to go in style.  ""Calling it a smartphone doesn't come close to how people use it, view it and embrace it in their lives,"" said Debby Ruth, senior vice president of the consumer research firm Magid. ""It's an extension of themselves, it's their entry into the world, it's their connection to their friends.""  From that perspective, it's easy to understand why some smartphones now cost more than many kinds of laptop computers, said technology analyst Patrick Moorhead.  ""People now value their phones more than any other device and, in some cases, even more than food and sex,"" Moorhead said.  THE LUXURY-GOOD CHALLENGE  Longtime Apple expert Gene Munster, now managing partner at research and venture capital firm Loup Ventures, predicts 20 percent of the iPhones sold during the next year will be the new $1,000 model.  Wireless carriers eager to connect with Apple's generally affluent clientele are likely to either sell the iPhone at a discount or offer appealing subsidies that spread the cost of the device over two to three years to minimize the sticker shock, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research.  Even if Munster's sales forecast holds true, it still shows most people either can't afford or aren't interested in paying that much for a smartphone.  That's one reason Apple also is expected to announce minor upgrades to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. That will make it easier for Apple to create several different pricing tiers, with the oldest model possibly becoming available for free with a wireless contract.  But the deluxe model virtually assures that the average price of the iPhone — now at $606 versus $561 three years ago — will keep climbing. That runs counter to the usual tech trajectory in which the price of electronics, whether televisions or computers, falls over time.  ""The iPhone has always had a way of defying the law of physics,"" Munster said, ""and I think it will do it in spades with this higher priced one.""",2.0,2.0

President Donald Trump’s former chief strategist Steve Bannon is boosting multiple challengers to GOP incumbents and the party’s preferred candidates in next year’s midterm elections(AP Photo/Brynn Anderson, File)  JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Steve Bannon has a stark message to Republican incumbents he considers part of the establishment: “Nobody can run and hide.”  President Donald Trump’s former chief strategist is promoting a field of potential primary challengers to take on disfavored Republicans in Congress and step up for open seats. Among the outsiders: a convicted felon, a perennial candidate linked to an environmental conspiracy theory and a Southern lawmaker known for provocative ethnic and racial comments.  It’s an insurgency that could imperil Republican majorities in the House and Senate. Bannon called it a “populist nationalist conservative revolt” in a speech to religious conservatives in Washington on Saturday.  The emerging Bannon class of rabble-rousers shares limited ideological ties but a common intent to upend Washington and knock out Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., standard-bearer of the establishment.  So intent is Bannon on bringing down McConnell that he laid down this marker Saturday to some of the incumbents at risk of a challenge from his flank of the party: disavow McConnell, satisfy other conditions and possibly escape the wrath.  “Until that time,” he said, the message to the elite is: “They’re coming for you.”  The crop of outsider candidates unnerves a GOP that lost seats — and a shot at the Senate majority — in 2010 and 2012 with political novices and controversial nominees and fears a stinging repeat in 2018.  “The main thing that binds them together is a rejection of the Republican Party establishment, a rejection of the political elites, the financial elites and the media elites,” said Andy Surabian, a former Bannon aide and senior adviser to the pro-Trump PAC Great America Alliance.  Bannon told the religious conservatives that economic nationalism and anti-globalism, the same forces he said elected Trump, can overpower Republican elites.  “This is our war,” he said. “The establishment started it. ... You all are gonna finish it.”  To escape it, he suggested, Senate incumbents can oppose McConnell, eliminate the filibuster that he says is impeding Trump’s agenda and denounce Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, a Republican who gave a scorching appraisal of Trump as an untethered leader who could lead the U.S. into another world war.  Bannon singled out John Barrasso of Wyoming, Deb Fischer of Nebraska and Dean Heller of Nevada as senators who “vote the right way” but did not step up to condemn Corker. There’s still time for a “mea culpa,” he said, implying such senators could be spared his insurgency if they toed his line.  Senate Republicans had been upbeat about adding to their 52-48 majority, especially with Democrats defending more seats next year, 10 in states Trump won in last year’s presidential election.  But the Bannon challenge could cost them, leaving incumbents on the losing end in primaries or GOP candidates roughed up for the general election.  Bannon helped elevate twice-suspended Judge Roy Moore, who won an Alabama runoff over McConnell’s pick, Sen. Luther Strange. Moore was removed from office for refusing to remove a Ten Commandments monument from Alabama’s judicial building, then suspended for insisting probate judges refuse same-sex couples marriage licenses. He faces Democrat Doug Jones in a December election where polls find a single-digit lead for the Republican, a remarkable development in Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ heavily GOP state.  In West Virginia, the grassroots conservative group Tea Party Express endorsed Patrick Morrissey, also a Great America Alliance choice, over establishment favorite Rep. Evan Jenkins in a competitive race to unseat Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin.  Consider Mississippi, where state Sen. Chris McDaniel lost to veteran Sen. Thad Cochran in 2014, but is weighing a bid next year against Roger Wicker, the state’s other senator in the national legislature.  McDaniel misdefined “mamacita,” the Spanish word for mommy, as “hot mama,” and said he would withhold his tax payments if the government paid reparations for slavery — comments he made years earlier as a radio host but critics unearthed during the campaign. He also denounced a supporter who photographed and posted an image of Cochran’s bed-ridden wife in 2014.  He argued in court that his loss to Cochran was due in part to Democrats, many of them African-American, fraudulently voting in the primary. He’s back again and speaking in Bannon terms.  “They will do anything, they will say anything, to just maintain a hold on power,” McDaniel said in an Associated Press interview about McConnell and his allies.  In Arizona, former state Sen. Kelli Ward, who is challenging Trump antagonist Sen. Jeff Flake, remains known for entertaining the debunked theory that jet aircraft are used to affect the weather or poison people intentionally.  Former New York Rep. Michael Grimm, who spent eight months in prison for federal tax evasion, is challenging two-term Rep. Dan Donovan — with the encouragement of Bannon.  In announcing his candidacy, Grimm was apologetic for his conviction. Still out there are viral videos of him telling a television reporter during an on-camera interview at the U.S. Capitol after a question he didn’t like: “You ever do that to me again, I’ll throw you off this (expletive) balcony.”  House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., is sticking with the incumbent: “I support Dan Donovan, plain and simple,” Ryan said this past week.  But he stopped short of suggesting Bannon stand down. “It’s a free country,” he said.  In Nevada, Bannon is encouraging Republican Danny Tarkanian in his challenge to Heller. Tarkanian, son of famed basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian, is 0-5 in state and federal elections.  These outsiders share strong opposition to increasing the nation’s debt even if it means an economy-rattling default. They also share unsparing criticism of congressional Republicans, especially McConnell, for failing to dismantle the Obama-era health care law, an unfulfilled seven-year-old promise.  In Wyoming, Erik Prince, founder of security contractor Blackwater, is considering a Republican primary challenge to Barrasso, a senior member of the Senate GOP leadership team. Bannon has urged Prince, brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, to run.  Bannon has given at least one Senate incumbent — Texas Sen. Ted Cruz — a pass, but not others.  ___  Beaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.",4.0,10.0
777,2198,10,24,2017,2017-10-24,The New York Times,"The Economy Is Humming, but That May Not Win Janet Yellen Another Term","During her four-year term, the unemployment rate has fallen to 4.2 percent while inflation has remained below 2 percent. Both metrics are close to the levels the Fed regards as ideal. Indeed, it has seldom come closer. She also has presided over the gradual reduction of the Fed’s stimulus campaign, which was implemented in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, as the economy struggled through a bruising recession with persistent unemployment that peaked at 10 percent in October 2009.  Ms. Yellen’s calm and careful leadership style has won fans, both inside and outside of the Fed. John Williams, president of the San Francisco Fed, said that Ms. Yellen had been effective in building a consensus about the direction of policy among Fed officials, and in communicating policy to the markets and the public.  “When she came in there was a lot of concern about how would we unwind our policies and would that be disruptive and difficult, especially in the context of a global economy where other central banks were going in the other direction,” he said. “Now it’s almost like, ‘That was easy!’ But it wasn’t. It took hard work.”  Some of the other candidates, notably Mr. Taylor and Mr. Warsh, have argued the Fed should be raising interest rates more quickly. But financial regulation is the area in which a new chairman likely would make the largest changes. The Fed supervises the nation’s largest banks and oversees the broader financial system.  Mr. Trump wants to loosen financial regulations, which he regards as an impediment to economic growth. Ms. Yellen, who played a key role implementing the new banking rules after the 2008 crisis, has acknowledged room for improvement. But in a high-profile speech in August, she also issued a warning against going too far.  The Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, has argued that installing a new Fed chairman would help Mr. Trump achieve his goal of reducing regulation.  Charles W. Calomiris, a finance professor at Columbia University, said that Ms. Yellen’s approach to regulation was reason enough to replace her. “It’s not just that regulation is excessively costly and complex,” he said. “It’s also failing to achieve its objectives.”",50.0,82.0

It is another triumph for LIGO, short for Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, the instrument that has opened a new window into the universe by detecting shakings in the fabric of space-time known as gravitational waves. Previously, LIGO, had detected three mergers of black holes. Scientists who helped create LIGO also just won the Nobel Prize in Physics.

708,2121,10,17,2017,2017-10-17,Vox,The Senate's new Obamacare stabilization deal faces a lot of unanswered questions,"This is the web version of VoxCare, a daily newsletter from Vox on the latest twists and turns in America’s health care debate. Like what you’re reading? Sign up to get VoxCare in your inbox here.  We have an Obamacare stabilization deal. Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander, who had been working with Democratic Sen. Patty Murray for the past few months, announced it this afternoon.  This would be the gist, per they summary I obtained and conversations with lobbyists:  Funding for cost-sharing reduction payments for the rest of 2017, 2018, and 2019  Funding for state Obamacare outreach  Expanded eligibility for the law's catastrophic plans, which is currently limited to people under age 30  Some more state flexibility under the Obamacare 1332 waiver program, streamlined approvals, and longer waiver length  But that outline comes with a lot of caveats and TBDs.  1) We don't have the fine print yet  Alexander and Murray might have a deal, but they don't have a bill. (Murray told Kaiser Health News's Julie Rovner they were ""still ironing out a few details.)  ""They merely have an agreement in concept only"" is how one lobbyist put it to me.  The details are going to matter, particularly on the 1332 waivers. Obamacare created guardrails in the waiver program, which required any state plans to provide coverage that was as ""comprehensive"" as what the health care law offers. Alexander talked about revising that standard to ""comparable affordability.""  Senators are also promising to prevent ""double dipping"" — which presumably means plans reaping both increased premiums after they hiked rates to account for no CSRs and then the CSRs that the bill funds.  The specifics will matter a lot for both those provisions, as well as the precise effect on the market from expanded catastrophic coverage.  2) We don’t know if it can pass Congress  Alexander and Murray are two senators. They need 49 more. The big question is whether Senate Republican leaders, who already scuttled the duo’s talks once in favor of another Obamacare repeal bill, will want a majority of their own conference on board before they bring a bill stabilizing the law to the Senate floor.  “I will not tell you that we have a majority of all the Republicans yet,” Sen. Mike Rounds, who supports the deal, told reporters. “I think we’re getting closer.”  Even if the bill gets out of the Senate, the House would have to agree to it. There are early signs of trouble.  ""The GOP should focus on repealing & replacing Obamacare, not trying to save it. This bailout is unacceptable,” Rep. Mark Walker (R-NC), who leads the influential Republican Study Committee, said in a statement.  Then you have President Trump. On Tuesday, he sounded positive about a short-term stabilization plan. Will that still be true tomorrow?  3) The damage to 2018 rates is probably already done  Contracts for the federal marketplace are signed, sealed, and delivered. Insurers have already hiked their premiums for next year, after months of Trump threats to cut off the cost-sharing reductions, which he finally did last week.  We did see states and plans react quickly to Trump’s decision. It’s possible they could change course quickly again if Congress acts fast. (Also remember: Most people will be protected from higher premiums by Obamacare’s tax subsidies.)  But don’t bet on it. My sources believe the Alexander-Murray deal’s only chance of passage would be if it’s folded into a bigger government spending/debt limit package in December.  Nevertheless, this plan, if it comes to pass, isn’t nothing. It’s a sign of good-faith legislating, and by taking the CSR threats off the table for 2019, it could have a real effect on rates down the road.  But it isn’t going to fix things right away or all on its own.  vox-mark VoxCare Vox's email explaining the biggest news in health care, edited by Sarah Kliff Subscribe By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy.

30,195,8,31,2017,2017-08-31,Vox,Trump says the US has the highest corporate tax rate in the world. He's wrong.,"President Donald Trump began his sales job for wide-ranging tax cuts Wednesday by arguing that the US needs to shrink its corporate tax rate if it wants to have any hope of competing with its economic rivals.  “When it comes to the business tax we are dead last, can you believe that?” Trump said during his remarks in Springfield, Missouri. “We have totally surrendered our competitive edge to other countries.""  But what he doesn’t note is that while on paper the US business tax rate is exceptionally high, in practice the US taxes its businesses at similar rates to its international peers. And so Trump’s dire warnings about the need to lower the business tax code is really part of an effort to push through a gift to American corporations rather than make a serious bid to catch up to the rest of the world.  During his remarks, Trump referred to the US’s 35 percent statutory corporate tax rate. He said that the rate, which is technically one of the highest in the world, suffocates American businesses and compels them to ship jobs overseas.  But that’s inaccurate on a number of levels.  “It’s a bit misleading because our corporate tax code is riddled with loopholes and what corporations pay is far, far lower — somewhere between 13 and 21 percent,” Hunter Blair, a tax and budget analyst at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, told me.  “When you get down to specific companies, sometimes they pay 3, 4, 5 percent,” he added.  According to a 2017 Congressional Budget Office report, the US’s effective corporate tax rate — the rate that factors in these loopholes — clocks in at 18.6 percent. That’s lower than in Japan (21.7 percent) and the UK (18.7 percent) and only a few percentage points higher than Germany (15.5 percent).  Steven Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban Brookings Tax Policy Center, told me that the loopholes are so pervasive that the formal rate is “irrelevant.”  “When you take into account the loopholes in US tax code, our [business] taxes are pretty much the same as our competitors,” Rosenthal said.  Corporations thrive using offshore tax havens  Big multinational corporations commonly make use of the deferral loophole, which allows them to avoid taxes on profits made abroad.  That exception creates incentives for corporations to use accounting gimmicks to shift profits made at home to overseas subsidiaries and to funnel money through foreign tax havens where they owe little to no tax.  According to a 2017 report by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, Fortune 500 companies are dodging up to $767 billion in US federal income taxes by keeping more than $2.6 trillion of their profits offshore.  Trump also charges that the US’s stifling corporate tax rate is to blame for jobs being shipped overseas. He said other countries “made their taxes lower — and far lower in many cases than ours — and jobs left our country.”  But that’s a crude simplification of why corporations move their operations abroad, which happens for plenty of other reasons, like cheaper labor costs.  “Tax rates are only a small piece of the factors that determine where a company locates,” Rosenthal said. “[Other factors are] educated work force, infrastructure, rule of law. To highlight taxes in isolation is misleading.”  Instead of trying to lower the corporate tax code, Trump should consider closing the loopholes that allow them to sidestep the rate at which they’re actually supposed to be taxed. Right now, corporations, which are making record profits, are doing just fine.",1.0,1.0
1225,2823,10,31,2017,2017-10-31,Vox,President Obama wants to give young leaders around the world the tools to organize,"In a speech at his foundation’s “leadership summit” on Tuesday, President Barack Obama didn’t discuss President Donald Trump or the Russia scandal or the Republican attempts to dismantle Obamacare.  Instead, the former president spoke at length about his time as an organizer on the South Side of Chicago — an experience he cited as crucial for informing the two-day summit that just kicked off at the new Obama Foundation. The event attracted some famous attendees, including Prince Harry, artist Theaster Gates, former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, as well as musicians like Gloria Estefan, the band the National, and Chance the Rapper.  Obama explained that more than 500 “rising and established community leaders” were attending the event because the foundation was hoping to learn how it could best help young organizers across both the country and around the world. One of the foundation’s goals is to figure out to how give grassroots organizers and young people the tools to convene meetings or rally around a cause. Obama said the project was partly inspired by the job as a community organizer he’d been given by a group of churches in his 20s.  “They had no money, so all they could afford to do was hire me,” he said of the churches. But Obama explained that early experience in local organizing — fighting for a public park in a drug-infested part of town; taking on an environmental crisis at a public housing project — left a profound impact on him. Obama suggested that in his post-presidency, he wants to give young activists from around the world the capacity to organize that he only barely had on the South Side:  The thing that was most exciting for me was the idea of creating a hub, a venue a place, a network in which all these young people across the globe and across the country ... could start meeting each other, and seeing each other, and teaching each other, and learning from each other. Because if we could create an architecture — a platform — for those young people to thrive, and to grow, and to scale up all the amazing stuff they’re already doing locally, and not to just root themselves locally but to germinate and seed all around the country and all around the world, then there’s no problem we couldn’t solve. Then there’s no aspiration that we might not reach. And so that’s the plan. That’s the vision.  Obama: “Our goal here is not to create a political movement”  But what was as perhaps as interesting as what Obama said is what he didn’t. As former aides to the president have told me, Obama is acutely aware that whatever he says or does will be interpreted as a rebuke of, or commentary on, Donald Trump. That aversion toward overt political action — or even implicit criticism of his successor — carried into his speech on Tuesday.  “Don’t be partisan. Our goal here is not to create a political movement,” Obama told the summit attendees. “I believe firmly in politics, but the moment we’re in right now politics is the tail and not the dog.”  As I’ve previously reported, some critics have noted that Obama’s post-presidential goals appear to be to combine political goals with apolitical means. “We got into the weakest position in decades through Obama’s attempt to live in a post-partisan world that doesn’t exist,” said Charles Chamberlain of Democracy for America. “The president should be doing exactly what everyone else in the Democratic Party should be doing: following the resistance, fighting back against Trump, or getting out of the way.”  Even his speech today referenced the achievements of the civil rights movement, before stressing that the goals of this event were not political. As he has in the past, Obama instead suggested that American politics could not be fixed without first fixing the culture that produced it. “What we need to do is think about our civic culture,” he said.  Obama followed that proclamation up by announcing one ground rule for the summit: Attendees would not be allowed to take selfies. He and Michelle Obama, he added, were interested in having real face-to-face conversations with the event’s participants.  “It sounds trivial,” he added. “But it’s not.”",20.0,17.0
158,953,6,5,2017,2017-06-05,Vox,Google is the internet's largest ad company. So why is it building an ad blocker?,"Google has a plan to protect users of its market-leading Chrome web browsers from intrusive ads. It’s a plan that could make the web browsing experience better for tens of millions of people. But it could also raise thorny questions about Google’s growing market power.  “It’s far too common that people encounter annoying, intrusive ads on the web,” writes Sridhar Ramaswamy in a Thursday blog post, “like the kind that blare music unexpectedly, or force you to wait 10 seconds before you can see the content on the page.”  The new Chrome feature, slated to be rolled out next year, won’t block all ads. Rather, it will block ads that Google considers particularly intrusive. Google is publishing guidelines to help site owners understand which ads are likely to be blocked. The company hopes that most publishers will drop the most annoying ad formats from their sites, improving the browsing experience for everyone without many ads actually being blocked.  This is something Google CEO Larry Page has been thinking about for years. “The industry needs to do better at producing ads that are less annoying and that are quicker to load,” he said in 2015. “I think we need to do a better job of that as an industry.”  The tricky issue here is that in addition to having the internet’s most popular web browser, Google is also one of the biggest companies in the advertising business. And that creates a danger that it could use its power in the browser market to give itself a leg up in the ad market.  “Google has a lot of power,” says Mark Patterson, a Fordham legal scholar who has written a book on antitrust in the internet age. “This is dictating what sort of ads will be permitted if you use Chrome.” And given Chrome’s popularity, those rules are likely to become de facto standards across the web.  Patterson worries about a private company having so much power over the kinds of ads that appear online. But he doesn’t think Google has much to worry about on the regulatory front.  “It's hard to see a court getting really agitated about Google trying to eliminate annoying ads,” he says. “Annoying ads are annoying. Any effort to get rid of them could be seen as a good thing.”  Antitrust officials are likely to decide they have bigger issues to worry about, Patterson predicts.  Google is trying to use its clout to squash intrusive ads  For years, Google has tried to use its influence to raise standards across the web. For example, pages that have more ads than content at the top automatically get downgraded in Google search results. Google has long penalized websites that load too slowly. More recently, it has started giving preference in search results to sites that use the secure SSL encryption standard.  In the short run, these policies help Google’s users find sites that are fast-loading, secure, and not cluttered with ads. But more significant is the incentive it creates for online publishers. Almost all websites want to maximize their ranking in Google search results, so rewarding sites that deliver a better user experience gives site operators a stronger incentive to improve their sites.  Chrome’s market share has grown in recent years to reach a majority of the desktop market. Which means that Google’s browser now has the same kind of powerful influence that its search engine has long enjoyed. And so it’s pursuing the same strategy: rolling out a new feature that will protect Chrome users from intrusive ads in the short run, while giving online publishers a powerful incentive to stop using intrusive ads altogether.  And that incentive will be powerful. About half of web users are on Chrome, and most of them will accept the default configuration of Chrome. So any publisher that refuses to comply with Google’s ad quality standards could suddenly see a large fraction of its ads blocked, with devastating effects on its ad revenue. So we can expect publishers to scramble to comply with Google’s requirements in the coming months.  Google is making a preemptive strike against third-party ad blockers  Google is clearly worried about the potential antitrust implications here. The company has joined a broad advertising group called the Coalition for Better Ads that played a key role in drafting the ad quality standards Google will be enforcing. The goal is to position these rules as reflecting widely accepted industry standards rather than Google’s idiosyncratic priorities.  Essentially, Patterson says, “it's a cartel orchestrated by Google.” Publishers and ad networks that are already enforcing high standards have every reason to want spammier ad networks driven off the web.  And one common challenge shared by Google and other advertisers is the rise of third-party ad blockers. Google’s new feature won’t block all ads, just ads Google and its partners consider bad. In contrast, competing products like AdBlock Plus have the ability to block ads altogether — including Google’s.  Eyeo, the company behind AdBlock Plus, has a program that’s somewhat like the one Google announced this week. The company has published a list of criteria for “acceptable ads,” and publishers that meet the criteria can apply to be on a whitelist. Inclusion on the list is free for smaller sites, but larger sites have to pay Eyeo to be included.  A relatively new browser called Brave has a similar business model. It blocks third-party ads, replaces them with its own ads, and offers sites a share of the resulting revenue. Needless to say, publishers and ad networks don’t like this at all.  Banishing the worst ads from the web will reduce user interest in third-party ad blockers that block everyone’s ads. That will discourage other companies from trying to capitalize on user dissatisfaction to get a cut of companies’ ad revenue. And that would be good for Google’s bottom line.",4.0,7.0
1189,2787,10,30,2017,2017-10-30,Breitbart,Five Things to Know About Paul Manafort Partner Rick Gates,"The Special Counsel investigating Russian interference and potential collusion on Monday charged lobbyist and former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and his longtime business partner Rick Gates with 12 counts associated with money laundering. Although Manafort is a well-known Republican political figure, less is known about his associate. Below are five things people should know about Gates.  Who is Rick Gates?  Rick Gates, 45, is Paul Manafort’s protege and longtime junior partner. Gates started as an intern at Black, Manafort, Stone, Kelly, a D.C. consulting firm in the 1980s. He joined Manafort’s consulting firm, Davis Manafort, in 2006, working in Ukraine. Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska was their client and reportedly paid them tens of millions. The relationship reportedly soured some time afterwards.  How is Rick Gates connected with the Trump campaign?  When Manafort became Trump’s campaign manager in late May 2016, Gates became number two and was considered a core member in August, according to the New York Daily News.  However, after Manafort left in August over his business ties with Russia, Gates stayed on for “weeks” as a liaison to the Republican National Committee but was reportedly out by late September. Gates was reportedly not paid throughout his time on the campaign.  What did Gates do after leaving the Trump campaign?  Afterwards, Gates reportedly worked on the presidential inaugural committee and on a lobbying group formed to advance Trump’s agenda, America First Policies, but left around March as the FBI publicly announced it was investigating Russian interference and any collusion in the election.  By June, it has been said, he was working for Tom Barrack, a millionaire and former Trump fundraiser who led the presidential inaugural committee, according to the Daily Beast. When Barrack — a close friend of the president — has stopped by the White House to meet with Trump, he has brought Gates with him, the outlet reported.  How well does Gates know Trump?  Apparently, not well. According to the Daily Beast article, Trump barely knows Gates and does not even like him.  When Gates would visit the White House with Barrack, he just “wandered around,” the article said. A Republican source told the outlet, “My understanding is that [Trump] had no idea he was in the building otherwise he wouldn’t be too happy.”  Trump considered Gates a “hanger-on,” multiple sources said. One source said, “Trump still hates him,” derisively calling Gates “Manafort’s rabbi.”  Trump did not know that Gates was working for him until weeks after his hiring when Trump asked, “Who the hell is that?” Another former campaign official referred to him as Trump’s “whipping boy.”  What is Gates charged with?  Gates and Manafort are both charged essentially with money laundering related to their work from 2006 through 2016 as consultants and lobbyists for the former pro-Russia Ukrainian President Victor Yanokovych and his pro-Russia party “Party of Regions.” They allegedly have maintained foreign accounts in at least three countries into which millions of dollars of payments were made and did not disclose those accounts to federal authorities in line with laws regulating that lobbying.  The indictment lists 12 counts, including “conspiracy against the United States.” That refers to the alleged illegal agreement between the two men to commit criminal acts that defrauded the government, not collusion with a foreign power.

1066,2644,4,19,2017,2017-04-19,Vox,Trump’s wall won’t stop heroin from coming into the US,"President Donald Trump has advertised his idea for a “big, beautiful wall” at the US-Mexico border by arguing it will stop the flow of drugs into the US — a particularly timely goal as the US struggles with its worst drug overdose crisis ever in the opioid epidemic.  “An astonishing 90 percent of the heroin in America comes from south of the border, where we will be building a wall which will greatly help in this problem,” Trump said on Thursday as he announced that he’s declaring a public health emergency over the opioid crisis. “We’ll have a great impact.”  The wall’s heroin-fighting capabilities, however, could face a big nemesis: an ice cream truck.  It’s a scene out of TV shows like Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul: A truck transporting legal goods (like ice cream) goes through the US border, sneaking illicit drugs through security inspections by simply hiding them — whether among the other products, a secret compartment, or some other tricky spot.  Scenarios like this aren’t just the stuff of fiction; drug trafficking through a legal port of entry is how most illegal drugs make it into the US. And this kind of smuggling will be totally unaffected by a wall put in place to block illegal border crossings, showing that even the toughest border security measures may be next to worthless for dealing with illegal drugs.  To the extent that drugs do come through the areas a wall would cover, border security and drug policy experts say the wall will have little to no effect. That’s in part because traffickers are really good at figuring ways around obstacles — whether it’s launching drugs over the wall, carrying them under the wall, or sailing around it. But it’s also because if a wall did end up a big barrier, traffickers would probably just shift their operations to find other ways into the US.  “A wall alone cannot stop the flow of drugs into the United States,” Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center, told me. “If we’re talking about a broader increase in border security, there could be some — probably minor — implications for the overall numbers of drugs being trafficked. But history shows us that border enforcement has been much more effective at changing the when and where of drugs being brought into the United States rather than the overall amount of drugs being brought into the United States.”  All of that is to say that while Trump’s wall may be many things, there’s wide agreement among experts and in the empirical research that it won’t do much, if anything, to halt illegal drug trafficking. Drug trafficking organizations just have too much of a financial incentive — from the hundreds of billions they make in the illegal drug trade — to let a wall stand in their way, so they’ll come up with solutions, from ice cream trucks to submarines, to overcome any barriers to those profits.  Most drugs come through legal ports of entry  Among experts, there’s a consensus: Tougher border security measures, like a wall, don’t have much of an effect on drug trafficking. A 2013 report by journalist Reed Karaim summarized the general view, following years of border security buildups:  Most border security analysts say there is little evidence the buildup has significantly reduced the availability of illegal narcotics in the United States. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has cited reduced use of some drugs, especially cocaine, as proof the buildup is working. But other drugs have grown in popularity, and smugglers have proved adept at shifting their methods and locations in response to interdiction efforts.  One of the big problems is that these border security measures typically target the areas between legal ports of entry. But most drugs come through legal ports of entry.  It’s hard, given the nature of the black market, to draw up any hard numbers showing this, but the best data we have comes from the federal government. As the DEA concluded in 2015, drug traffickers “transport the bulk of their goods over the Southwest Border through ports of entry (POEs) using passenger vehicles or tractor trailers.” Wilson further clarified that while marijuana is often trafficked in the areas between official crossing points (which a wall would cover), harder drugs like cocaine, meth, and heroin mostly come to the US through the legal ports of entry.  “If the goal of border security policy is to cut into drug trafficking, the investments would be better made at the ports of entry,” Wilson said. Indeed, some of that work has happened in the past few years — with more personnel, drug-sniffing dogs, X-rays, better electronic records, and other technologies that can help catch drug traffickers.  But this isn’t a big part of the conversation about drug trafficking and border security in the US. In fact, Trump’s budget blueprint didn’t even mention the offices that deal with security at legal ports of entry: US Customs and Border Protection and its Office of Field Operations. Instead, the blueprint focused on the wall and unauthorized immigration. That doesn’t mean there won’t be a greater investment in security at legal ports of entry, but it does seem like this type of security isn’t a big priority, at least rhetorically, for the Trump administration — or in the public dialogue about drugs and border security.  The reality, though, is that even if the US did significantly increase security at legal ports of entry, it simply can’t catch all the drugs going through the border — at least without significantly damaging the economy by slowing down a massive point of trade between two neighboring allies.  “It’s a needle-in-a-haystack kind of a problem,” Wilson said. “The vast majority of crossings at ports of entry are people going about their day-to-day business [and] doing things that are totally legal and legitimate, whether going to work or school or shopping or trucking goods back and forth across the US-Mexico border.”  “We’re talking about a million licit crossings every day of people at the official crossing point,” Wilson added. “We’re talking about a million dollars of commerce between the United States and Mexico every minute. It’s just a huge amount of traffic — licit traffic — moving across the border.”  This is exactly why many drug traffickers resort to legal ports of entry: When there’s so much legal traffic to hide within, it’s safer and more reliable to go through a legal port of entry than to try a perilous journey through a desert or river patrolled by guards.  Drug traffickers have come up with all sorts of ways to overcome a wall  Some drugs do, however, make it through the areas between legal ports of entry. Could a wall stop those drugs from flowing into the US?  Experts, again, generally argue that it would not. What tighter border security, like a wall, by and large changes is how traffickers get drugs into the US rather than whether they do.  A wall, then, might get traffickers to rely more on legal ports of entry. Others may adapt new tactics and tools to get around tougher border security measures. But it won’t get them to stop trafficking altogether.  “An increase in border security could lead to greater use of technology,” Wilson said, “whether that’s a catapult, ultralight, or tunnel technology.”  This isn’t hypothetical. Over the past several decades, drug traffickers have come up with all sorts of ingenious ways to bypass border security. Here are a few examples, which, while not all very common, show the ridiculous lengths criminals are willing to go to get drugs in the US:  Tunnels: These burrow under the US-Mexico border — including the fencing that exists already — to create a vast network of underground drug smuggling. According to the Los Angeles Times, drug cartels have dug up dozens of these kinds of tunnels over the past decade — and they have continued successfully using some of the tunnels even after US and Mexican law enforcement officials discovered them. Drones: Drug cartels have made increasing use of drones over the past few years. In 2015, US officials caught a drone allegedly carrying 28 pounds of heroin, which federal prosecutors described as “the first international narcotics seizure by U.S. law enforcement involving the use of drones by Mexican drug traffickers.” It’s now to the point that the US Border Patrol reportedly flies a blimp with low-altitude radar to catch the drones in action. Submarines: Both submersibles and semi-submersibles have been used to send drugs from South America to the US, largely from Colombia to Mexico. These vehicles often are homemade, but they can be extremely sophisticated. Jay Bergman, head of the DEA’s Andean division, told Time magazine that the submarines in particular were “a quantum leap of technology” from the semi-submersibles, describing the new subs as “the difference between building a motor-scooter and building a car.” Bazookas: In a particularly ridiculous example, Mexican officials discovered a cannon — which they called a “homemade bazooka” — that might have been used to fling drugs across the border. US authorities have reported similar contraptions since at least 2012 with the ability to launch cans of drugs hundreds of meters from the border. Narco-torpedoes: One of the most advanced tools that drug traffickers have used are narco-torpedoes. These go deep underwater, but they’re attached to boats with cables — making them practically undetectable from above the water. If a trafficking boat is ever caught or inspected, it can simply detach the cable, let the narco-torpedo float to the bottom of the ocean, and send someone else to pick it back up with the help of a homing device attached to the torpedo. And since the narco-torpedo is so deep underwater, typical detection methods won’t see it coming.  Some of these methods can sound downright ridiculous. But they show that traffickers are very good at coming up with all sorts of ways to get around security.  In this way, the war on drugs has made traffickers even better at what they do. As Sanho Tree, a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies who focuses on the war on drugs, told me, “So we go after shrimp boats and fishing boats [used to smuggle drugs] and stop those, and they respond with cigarette boats. We respond with faster boats and helicopters to take out those boats, and then they switch to submersibles. And then we get better at detecting those with spotting towers now, and they go the fully submersible route. And if we do catch those, there are ‘narco-torpedoes’ now; these can be bolted under the hull of a ship with release cables and homing devices.”  There’s one downside for drug traffickers: The arms race could make drugs more expensive. Building a submarine, after all, is not cheap, and that higher price could make drugs less accessible to drug users.  But to the extent that that’s true, the arms race doesn’t seem to have had much of an impact on drug prices even as the US has escalated its war on drugs: Since the 1980s, the price of heroin has plummeted by nearly 86 percent, according to federal data. As Trump has acknowledged, a dose of heroin can now cost less than a candy bar.  Still, it’s safe to assume that these measures make illicit drugs more expensive than they otherwise would be.  Even that, however, can create problems through what’s known as the “profit paradox”: While a drug’s prohibition and interdiction make it more expensive, the higher price also makes drugs more lucrative to criminal groups. It’s one reason drugs that cost literally pennies can turn into a hundred- or thousand-dollar commodity. Those massive profits give drug traffickers more reason to seek out ways, including some expensive methods, to continue trafficking drugs in the face of international and governmental resistance. So the cycle continues.  Even if a wall does slow drug trafficking from Mexico, the drugs will flow from somewhere else  Imagine, however, that the US manages to make drug smuggling through the Mexico border so difficult that traffickers eventually decide it’s not worth it anymore.  If that were to happen, chances are criminal groups wouldn’t just quit the business for good. They would likely shift their operations and trafficking routes to other parts of the world.  This, again, is not a hypothetical. As governments cracked down on cocaine production in Peru and Bolivia in the 1990s, cartels shifted to Colombia. As governments cracked down on the Netherland Antilles, traffickers went through West Africa. And as the US cracked down on trafficking in the Caribbean, drug producers and traffickers went to Mexico — which is why we’re now talking about Mexico to begin with.  It’s what’s called the “balloon effect”: As one part of a balloon is pushed down, the air is simply shifted to other parts of the balloon. This could happen should tough border security measures make the US-Mexico border too much of a hurdle for traffickers.  “Enforcement along the US-Mexico border could, potentially, push things back to the Caribbean or to some other routes, whether it pushes people to smuggle more drugs on flights into the United States [or] open a new route in the Pacific,” Wilson said. “We don’t know, but one of the things we’ve seen over time is that there’s been a balloon effect.”  All of this shows why focusing so much on the law enforcement and interdiction side of the war on drugs just doesn’t work — and didn’t prevent the opioid epidemic, the worst drug overdose crisis in US history. That’s why Wilson and other experts are calling on the US to put more toward reducing demand for drugs — through prevention and drug treatment programs — instead of focusing so much on supply.  “That doesn’t mean that interdiction can’t play a role in a more comprehensive, better strategy,” Wilson said. “It just means that what we’ve done so far is not enough.”  As nice as Trump’s wall might sound to him and his supporters, then, it’s just not the right answer to America’s massive drug crisis.",19.0,30.0
942,2444,10,23,2017,2017-10-23,Vox,So you’ve learned you’ve got a “pitifully” low IQ. How worried should you be?,"The past few years have seen an important shift in popular understanding of IQ. Dismissive slogans like ""IQ just measures how well you take tests"" have been replaced by a growing understanding of how IQ is real, partially hereditary, and predictive of important life outcomes.  Scientific sources like Nature argue that ""what most people know about intelligence must be updated,” and popular media including Vox itself reports on the ""mountain of research showing that it's a genuinely powerful predictor of your health, prosperity, and well-being.”  IQ denialism seems to be going the same way as climate denialism — complete with overwhelming scientific consensus on one side — and it's about time. But people's concerns about this subject are understandable. Given the role intelligence plays in our society, any number that purports to rank it — rightly or wrongly — is going to touch on a lot of issues close to our self-worth as human beings. Some people with high IQs have always hoped that makes them better than everyone else; other people with low IQs have always worried they might be worse. On a subreddit dealing with psychology and IQ-related issues, I see posts like this one:  This may be completely silly, and it's not something I'm proud of, but given the amount of weight that JBP has given to the predictive powers of IQ, I'm too scared to do a test and find out what it is. It reminds me of the question, ""if there was an envelope with your death date on it, would you read it?"" I don't like the deterministic nature of what my future holds, as I feel it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy if my IQ checks out low. Especially as what I want to do in life requires a lot of abstraction and creativity, and it leans heavily on one's mentality. If my IQ checks out as low, that'll be one more obstacle in the road to overcome, and I just don't want to invite that.  Or like this:  Hey everybody. I recently did an IQ test and scored 83. I'm really bummed out about this because [University of Toronto psychology professor] Jordan Peterson has mentioned multiple times that IQ is the biggest predictor of success. Also I spend my spare time doing things like reading, watching these and other types of educational videos. Now that I realise I'm so far under average —it really hurts. I don't really know the point of this post, I guess I'd just like some thoughts on this because I'm too ashamed to tell anyone else.  Or this:  When I was 16, as a part of an educational assessment, I took both the WAIS-IV and Woodcock Johnson Cognitive Batteries. ... I never got a chance to have a discussion with the psychologist about the results, so I was left to interpret them with me, myself, and the big I known as the Internet — a dangerous activity, I know. This meant two years to date of armchair research, and subsequently, an incessant fear of the implications of my below-average IQ, which stands at a pitiful 94. ... [I told myself:] stop trying to fit into intellectual shoes that are too big for you. This is your station in life. Accept that it is so statistically improbable that you will not contribute anything useful in STEM-related areas, you might as well minimize your opportunity cost.  These people are really hurting. If their concerns were accurate, then they would just have to learn to live with them. But I think they aren't. There's a middle ground, where people can admit IQ is scientifically useful for discovering statistical truths about society, but remain skeptical of its ability to judge individuals. For one thing, casual IQ testing isn't a great way of measuring individual intelligence. For another, even an accurate measure of individual intelligence can only make statistical predictions, not ironclad prophecies.  In official studies, IQ tests correlate very well with other IQ tests, the same IQ test repeated later on, and other tests of intellectual ability like the SAT. For example, IQ scores and SAT scores tend to correlate at around 0.7, a very impressive match. But I surveyed readers of my blog on their IQs and SAT scores. I told them to only report their scores on real professional tests — none of those internet IQ tests you get to from flashing banner ads with pictures of Einstein's face on them. I got about 500 data points. And the correlation was only about 0.3: far lower than it was supposed to be.  First — though least importantly — lots of IQ tests given outside labs are less than rigorous  Why? SATs are taken in standardized conditions. But it would make sense if people taking my survey got less accurate IQ results than the ones in the official studies. Some may have gotten less-than-kosher tests. Others might have gotten tests given by harried underqualified school counselors who had to rush to finish before lunch.  Others might not have tried their hardest; still others might have been sleep-deprived, or overcaffeinated, or undercaffeinated, or hungover. Some probably took it when they were too young for it to really count — IQ doesn't stabilize until late adolescence. Still others might have taken the test in ideal conditions, received an accurate result, and then forgotten what it was over the years. A few might just be lying. Again, none of this is surprising. Breaking news: Random people haphazardly testing something do worse than trained scientists formally measuring that thing, more at 11.  But these are the kinds of IQ tests those people like the commenters quoted above mean when they complain about their own IQ scores. None of them were in formal studies. None of them have given the sort of information that formal studies would need to make anybody take them seriously. Their scores probably aren't completely useless. But they're probably more like the scores that correlate at 0.3 with SATs than the ones that correlate at 0.7. (Also, intellectuals who are really concerned about their IQ and complain about their unexpectedly low scores are a heavily self-selected sample.)  These problems affect even the best of us. Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman talked about getting a 124 on the only IQ test he ever took. 124 is plenty bright — but Feynman was one of the greatest scientists of the 20th century; 124 is about 30 points off the lowest remotely plausible value. Scott Aaronson writes about his own similar experience taking an IQ test at age four and getting a 106 — right about average. Aaronson is a computer science professor studying the intersection of quantum mechanics and computational complexity. Nobody believes 106 is a remotely accurate measure of his intellect. He writes:  [I]f you want to know, let’s say, whether you can succeed as a physicist, then surely the best way to find out is to start studying physics and see how well you do. That will give you a much more accurate signal than a gross consumer index like IQ will —and conditioned on that signal, I’m guessing that your IQ score will provide almost zero additional information.  This isn't to say true scientific genius can't be measured by IQ. Someone formally IQ tested a group of eminent physicists and found IQs in the 150s and above — exactly what you would expect from a bunch of geniuses. The difference between them and Feynman and Aaronson is that the physicists in the sample were tested in adulthood in a formal scientific study, and Feynman and Aaronson are working off half-remembered IQ tests of unclear quality they took in school. If you took some half-remembered IQ test in school and heard you got a 106, then good news: For all you know, you too might have the ability to be a professor of quantum physics.  Even highly elite occupations include people with a broad range of IQ scores  But fine. Suppose you take all of that to heart, you carefully seek out the best and most reliable IQ tests, you take them after age 18 when IQ is most stable, you take multiple tests to double- and triple-check, and you find that you really, definitely, no doubt about it, have a low IQ. Now can you be miserable and self-hating? No. IQ predicts a bunch of things like income and success in various fields, but prediction is not prophecy. You have a somewhat reduced chance of high attainment, but you shouldn't take it as a death sentence.  Consider the gender pay gap. We know that men, for whatever reason, tend to earn more money than women. But we also know that some men are very poor and some women are very rich. Being a woman gives you a disadvantage but doesn't doom you. The same is true of having low IQ. Being a man gives you a leg up, but doesn't guarantee success; the same is true of high IQ. IQ correlates with income at about 0.2 to 0.3, about the same level as parental socioeconomic status. If you're low-IQ, you're less likely to succeed to the same degree that a kid from a poor family is less likely to succeed. But kids from poor families do sometimes succeed — Bill Clinton and Steve Jobs being famous examples.  We can both acknowledge that as a society we're depressingly bad at social mobility and truthfully tell individual poor kids that with enough luck and effort they can have a shot at success. It isn't just that people can compensate for their low IQ with hard work. They can, but it's not just that. It's that IQ is a very noisy measure of all intellectual talents averaged together, and some people with unimpressive general IQs can still be extremely talented in particular fields. Even such a stereotypically intellectual pursuit as chess only correlates with IQ at 0.24. (Though note that there may be limitations to that study — restriction of range — since it was done only on high-level players.)  Former chess champion Garry Kasparov had an IQ of 135 — high, but not so high that there wouldn't be dozens of people ""smarter"" than him at any decent college. No doubt Kasparov studied very hard — but so does everyone in high-level chess. He just had chess talent way higher than his IQ would have predicted — and this is exactly what we'd expect from the modest correlation between these two variables. Here's a chart of average IQ for various occupations, taken from this paper:  The chart perfectly demonstrates how IQ is both statistically reliable and individually unreliable. On average, intellectually demanding occupations like college professors have higher IQs than less demanding occupations like janitors. But individual janitors are sometimes higher-IQ than individual college professors. And almost every profession draws from a wide range of IQs. The average professor is pretty smart — but a nontrivial number have below-average IQs. Like Kasparov, they probably have some areas where their natural talent greatly exceeds what their IQ would predict — and like Kasparov, they probably supplemented that by working really hard.  This kind of thing matters not just because people worry about their IQ, but because a lot of the most controversial results in social science look kind of like this. Pay gaps associated with race, gender, family of origin, socioeconomic status, and education give some groups a statistical leg up beyond others. More controversially, there's recently been debate over more fundamental gender differences, and new results constantly come out about the genetic basis for various skills and problems.  Whatever direction these findings end up going in, one of the best ways to prevent them from becoming toxic and depressing is to remember that statistical tendencies apply only weakly to individuals — or, in more conventional terms — we should be wary of stereotyping. The problem with stereotypes isn't that they're never true, it's that they take a weak statistical effect and try to apply it to particular individuals. IQ is a real thing — some people really do have higher intelligence than others — but any attempt to use this to make predictions about individuals will fail more often than it will be worth it.

Harvey Weinstein Reminds Hillary Clinton of Donald Trump, Not Bill Clinton","Hillary Clinton reacted to the abuse scandal embroiling Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein by saying the American people elected someone guilty of sexual assault to the presidency.  She’s right. She just got the president wrong.  “Look, we just elected someone who admitted sexual assault to the presidency,” Hillary Clinton told Great Britain’s Channel 4 News. “So, there’s a lot of other issues that are swirling around these kinds of behaviors that need to be addressed.”  Like the proverbial mosquito in a nudist camp, where to begin?  Before Harvey Weinstein generated scores of accusations of misconduct (criminal and otherwise) involving less powerful women, Bill Clinton did. Juanita Broaddrick? Kathleen Willey? Paula Jones? We elected someone president accused of sexual assault in 1992. Mrs. Clinton’s political partner, not her political vanquisher, better fits her general complaint. Like Weinstein’s enablers, Bill Clinton’s chief enabler chalked up accusations against the 42nd president to a “a vast right-wing conspiracy” and labeled the women bimbos.

37,227,9,4,2017,2017-09-04,The New York Times,The Cost of Hurricane Harvey: Only One Recent Storm Comes Close,"It’s far too early for a definitive estimate of the economic damage caused by Hurricane Harvey. Floodwaters still swamp large swaths of the Houston area and beyond, into far eastern Texas and Louisiana.  But three independent estimates from people who specialize in disaster and risk management show that the storm is likely to be the most expensive or second-most expensive natural disaster in the United States since 1980, the earliest year such comparable data was kept by the National Centers for Environmental Information. On Friday, estimates for Harvey from these groups ranged from $70 billion to $108 billion.  The estimates are unofficial and changing daily as the storm continues and as the scope of the damage is better understood. But even these initial estimates stand out on a chart comparing the costs of every natural disaster costing $1 billion or more since 1980 (adjusted for inflation).  Billion-dollar natural disasters since 1980 Circles are sized proportionally to their cost in 2017 dollars Winter storms, freezing Drought and wildfire Flooding Tropical cyclones Severe storms  Harvey’s toll may yet increase and put the storm on a scale of economic devastation with Hurricane Katrina, which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) estimates cost about $160 billion in today’s dollars and resulted in 1,833 deaths.  There are several other estimates of the cost of Harvey not included here. A prominent one, by Joel Myers of Accuweather, is $190 billion. It is not included in the chart above because it may not be directly comparable with the estimates as NOAA calculates them. Mr. Myers’s estimate includes the “total negative impact on the economy,” he said, from supply chain interruptions to spoiled food.  “There are downstream impacts that other people might not have considered,” Mr. Myers said.  His prediction – nearly double the highest estimates included here – may ultimately prove to be correct. The estimates shown here have all been revised upward, though none show it to be more expensive than Katrina.  “Each day that passes, as the impacts multiply, it seems more likely that Harvey may ultimately eclipse the cost of Katrina, and it might not even be close,” said Adam Smith, a climatologist focusing on disaster economics with NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information. Mr. Smith has written about how NOAA estimates the costs of natural disasters.  The numbers for Harvey are educated guesses for now. It will be more than a month until NOAA releases its first official estimate, Mr. Smith said.  The groups making the estimates shown here are:  • RMS, a risk modeling firm based in California. It estimated the cost at $70 billion to $90 billion as of Thursday.  • Moody’s Analytics, a research firm. It estimated between $86 billion and $108 billion on Friday.  • Chuck Watson, a disaster modeler with Enki Research. He estimated $72 billion to $85 billion on Thursday.  Each of the three uses a mixture of models and observed data from the storm. They update their estimates as new information is available.  While no outside group can replicate the exact methodology that NOAA will use to assess the economic impact of the storm, Mr. Smith said the methods of these groups were broadly comparable to NOAA’s.  If anything, these numbers are likely to be conservative. Mr. Watson’s estimates for the cost of the storm have more than tripled, from his estimate of $22 billion on Aug. 25, the day before the storm made landfall. And Mr. Smith said even the first official account from NOAA, expected Oct. 6, is likely to be a lower-bound estimate, updated for months to come.  One reason estimates may continue to fluctuate is that flooding is an uncertain kind of damage to assess economically, in part because damage from floods is less likely to be covered by insurance. As the extent of flooding becomes better known, the uncertainty around these estimates will narrow.  Regardless, it’s clear this type of economic devastation from storms is becoming more common. In inflation-adjusted terms, the United States averaged fewer than three billion-dollar natural disasters per year from 1980 to 1990. Since 2010, it has averaged more than 10 per year.

1085,2663,10,28,2017,2017-10-28,Fox News,Corker doesn't rule out challenging Trump in 2020 Republican primary,"Less than three weeks after calling the White House an “adult day care center,” U.S. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., on Friday appeared open to the idea of challenging President Donald Trump in the 2020 GOP primary.  But while speaking to reporters at the 64th annual Governor’s Conference on Economic and Community Development, Corker said it was “way, way too early"" to decide whether to compete for the Republican presidential nomination, USA Today reported.  “So the only thing that I’m thinking about right now over the next 14 months truly is doing the best job I can as a senator,” Corker said. “You know, I don’t know what I’m doing next Sunday.”  The notion that Trump will be impeached is unrealistic, Corker said, even as some media reports speculated he was building a case for the president's removal from office.  Corker added that he was wary of contemplating a presidential run because of how it would affect his current responsibilities.  ""I think that if you even begin thinking those things, everything you do becomes viewed through a different lens,"" he said.  Corker, who has announced that he will not seek a third Senate term in 2018, has long feuded with the president. After the deadly violence at protests in Charlottesville, Va., in August, Corker said that Trump had demonstrated neither the “stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful.""  On Oct. 8, after Trump tweeted that Corker was a “negative voice” who lacked “the guts to run” for reelection without the president’s endorsement, Corker likened the White House to an “adult day care center.”  Later that day, Corker told the New York Times that Trump was setting the U.S. “on the path to World War III.” The president hit back, calling the senator a “lightweight” who ""couldn't get elected dog catcher in Tennessee.""  Corker again excoriated the president Tuesday, tweeting that he was “utterly untruthful” and vowing he would not support Trump in any future campaign.  But Corker acknowledged his attacks on Trump might not be endearing him to many of his constituents. In a survey conducted this month, Corker’s disapproval rating had soared to 41 percent in Tennessee, marking a 14-point increase since last spring. Meanwhile, Trump’s approval rating in the state has held steady at approximately 50 percent.  ""We were surprised that it hadn't dropped further than it did,"" Corker said of his approval rating.

701,2113,10,16,2017,2017-10-16,Associated Press News,Bombardier Inc. to partner with Airbus on C Series program,"Bombardier Inc. to partner with Airbus on C Series program  Bombardier president and CEO Alain Bellemare, left, and president Canada and chief operating officer of North America for Airbus Helicopters Romain Trapp shake hands during a press conference in Montreal on Monday, Oct. 16, 2017. Canadian plane maker Bombardier has a sold a majority stake in its C Series passenger jet business to European aerospace giant Airbus. (Paul Chiasson/The Canadian Press via AP)  TORONTO (AP) — Canadian plane maker Bombardier announced Monday it has sold a majority stake in its C Series passenger jet business to European aerospace giant Airbus for no cost.  U.S. rival Boeing called it a questionable deal by two state-subsidized competitors.  The move comes after lackluster sales and after the U.S. Commerce Department imposed harsh duties on Bombardier, charging the Canadian company is selling the C Series planes in America below cost and receiving government subsidies.  The Commerce Department recently announced it would impose an 80 percent duty on top of duties of nearly 220 percent. The case has been a win for Boeing, which brought the complaint.  Boeing has said it didn’t move early enough against Airbus subsidies in the 1970s. Airbus is now is a global giant.  “This looks like a questionable deal between two heavily state-subsidized competitors to skirt the recent findings of the U.S. government. Our position remains that everyone should play by the same rules for free and fair trade to work,” Boeing spokeman Dan Curran said in a statement.  The move by Bombardier could possibly circumvent duties being imposed on the C Series. The C Series headquarters will remain in the Montreal area but a second assembly line for the 100- to 150-seat plane will be set up at Airbus’ facility in Mobil, Alabama, so the plane can be sold in the United States.  Airbus Chief Executive Office Tom Enders said an aircraft produced at an U.S. Airbus facility would not be subject to duties under the pending U.S. investigation.  Enders said the acquisition extends the company’s product offering into the fast-growing 100-150 seat market sector. The current Airbus A320, a rival for the C Series, is for 180 passengers or more and Airbus hasn’t sold an A320 in three years.  Enders said some airlines have been reluctant to purchase Bombardier’s plane because of doubts the program would continue. It has been bailed out by governments in Quebec and Canada.  “Some customers will be convinced it will be a great product and it is here to stay,” Enders said.  The Airbus acquisition will be subject to Canadian government review but a federal official said the administration is aware of the challenges facing the C Series without a partner of the scale of Airbus. The official noted the plane has stalled at 300 orders but with Airbus they could get up to 6,000 orders over the next 20 to 30 years. The official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the deal, said the federal government has received a guarantee from Airbus that no jobs will be replaced or lost in Quebec because of the deal.  Enders said the talks started in August and were not motivated by what competitors are doing. He rejected a deal to acquire the C Series three years ago but said circumstances have changed, saying the plane is now certified and receiving rave reviews.  Airbus is not assuming any debt as part of the deal and it has an option to buy out Bombardier after 7 1/2 years and the Quebec government in 2023.  The C Series program drove Bombardier to the brink of bankruptcy two years ago before it was bailed out by the Quebec government.  Bombardier chief Alain Bellemare said having Airbus as a strategic partner “increases confidence that the aircraft is here to stay.”  He predicted they will secure more orders and double the value of the program. “By securing the U.S. market you end up securing the program,” he said.  Airbus will acquire a 50.01 percent interest in C Series Aircraft Limited Partnership, which manufactures and sells the plane. Bombardier will own 31 percent and the Quebec government’s investment agency will hold 19 percent.  Montreal-based Bombardier had dreamed of capturing half the global market for 100-to 149-seat planes. It has marketed the plane as being 20 percent more fuel-efficient than the comparable Airbus A320 and Boeing 737.  Chicago-based Boeing’s complaint claims Bombardier’s new C Series passenger aircraft receives Canadian government subsidies that give it an advantage internationally. The Quebec government invested US$1 billion in exchange for a 49.5 percent stake in the C Series last year. Canada’s federal government also recently provided a US$275 million loan to Bombardier, which struggled to win orders.  Bombardier won a 75-plane order for the C Series from U.S.-based Delta Air Lines in 2016. Bombardier said its planes never competed with Boeing in the sale to Delta.  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said his government could stop doing business with Boeing if the U.S. company doesn’t drop its trade complaint against Bombardier. Canada had been in talks to purchase 18 Super Hornet fighter jets from Boeing, but those have been on hold because of the Bombardier dispute.  “The attempt to weaken Bombardier has pushed it to join with one of its competitors, which should not have had needed to happen,” said Jerry Dias, national president of Unifor, Canada’s largest private sector union. “Ultimately, the U.S. actions have created a stronger Bombardier.”",70.0,78.0

Cases of dengue fever _ a painful mosquito-borne spread disease _ have doubled every decade since 1990 with 58.4 million cases and 10,000 deaths in 2013. Dr. Howard Frumkin, a former environmental health director at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said climate change, which allows mosquitoes to live in more places and stay active longer with shorter freeze seasons, is part but not all of the reason. (AP Photo/Muhammad Sajjad)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Global warming is hurting people’s health a bit more than previously thought, but there’s hope that the Earth — and populations — can heal if the planet kicks its coal habit, a group of doctors and other experts said.  The poor and elderly are most threatened by worsening climate change, but there remains “glimmers of progress” especially after the 2015 Paris agreement to limit heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions, according to a new big study published Monday in the British medical journal Lancet.  Comparing the report to a health checkup, four researchers and several outside experts described Earth’s prognosis as “guarded.”  “There are some very severe warning signs, but there are some hopeful indicators too,” said co-author Dr. Howard Frumkin, a professor of environmental health at the University of Washington. “Given the right treatment and aggressive efforts to prevent things from getting worse, I think there’s hope.”  The report highlighted health problems stemming from more frequent heat waves, disease spread by insects, air pollution and other woes. While the disasters have been costly, deaths haven’t been increasing because society is doing a better but more expensive job adjusting to the changing conditions, the researchers noted.  A team of 63 doctors, public health officials and scientists from around the world wrote what they considered the first of a regular monitoring of the health of the planet, similar to having a “finger on the pulse of the patient,” said Dr. Hugh Montgomery, an intensive care specialist and director of the University College of London’s Institute for Health and Performance.  Based on 40 indicators, the study said “the human symptoms of climate change are unequivocal and potentially irreversible.”  While other disease rates are dropping, cases of dengue fever — a mosquito-borne disease — has doubled every decade since 1990 with 58.4 million cases and 10,000 deaths in 2013. Frumkin, a former environmental health director at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said climate change, which allows mosquitoes to live in more places and stay active longer with shorter freeze seasons, is part but not all of the reason.  The same goes for the increase in tick-borne Lyme disease in the United States, Frumkin said, adding “the ticks do better with warmer weather.”  Between 2000 and last year, the number of vulnerable people — those over 65 or with chronic disease — exposed to heat waves increased by about 125 million, the study said.  It also highlighted the increasing likelihood of food shortages as climate change worsens.  Columbia University’s Madeline Thomson, who wasn’t part of the study team, praised the work, saying “climate is a stress multiplier” so it is important to monitor this way.  Acting on climate can have side benefits, Frumkin said. Cutting coal takes smog and soot out of the air, while eating less meat and bicycling and walking more to use less electricity means fewer accidents and reduced obesity, he said.  ___  Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears.

The California state legislature has opposed Trump’s agenda by becoming a so-called sanctuary state, as well as trying to force him to release his tax returns and even passing a resolution calling for him to apologize for “racist and bigoted behavior.”  Feinstein, however, took criticism from the left in August for expressing the hope that Trump would change to be more cooperative with Democrats.  “I just hope he has the ability to learn and to change, and if he does, he can be a good president,” she said, receiving boos from the San Francisco audience. She later said she is “under no illusion that it’s likely to happen and will continue to oppose his policies.”  De León will likely be one of multiple contenders for Feinstein’s seat. A source said Democratic mega-donor and environmentalist Tom Steyer is “very much looking at the Senate race,” and in a letter Wednesday he also called on Democrats to impeach Trump.

453,1807,10,9,2017,2017-10-09,The New York Times,Nobel in Economics Is Awarded to Richard Thaler," Richard H. Thaler, whose work has persuaded many economists to pay more attention to human behavior, and many governments to pay more attention to economics, was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences on Monday.  Professor Thaler is the rare economist to win a measure of fame before winning the prize. He is an author of a best-selling book, “Nudge,” about helping people to make better decisions. He also appeared in the 2015 film “The Big Short,” delivering what is surely one of the most widely viewed tutorials in the history of economics, on the causes of the 2008 financial crisis.  The Nobel committee, announcing the award in Stockholm, said that it was honoring Professor Thaler for his pioneering work in establishing that people are predictably irrational — that they consistently behave in ways that defy economic theory. People will refuse to pay more for an umbrella during a rainstorm; they will use the savings from lower gas prices to buy premium gasoline; they will offer to buy a coffee mug for $3 and refuse to sell it for $6.  The committee credited Professor Thaler, who teaches at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, for moving economics toward a more realistic understanding of human behavior, and for using the resulting insights to improve public policies, notably a sweeping shift toward the automatic enrollment of employees in retirement savings programs.",64.0,48.0

When Robert Lighthizer, Mr. Trump’s top trade negotiator, cut his teeth on trade diplomacy, back during the presidency of Ronald Reagan, the United States had an idiosyncratic way of solving its grievances over trade: asking its trading partners to curb their exports, or else.  In the early 1980s, Japan signed on to “voluntary export restraints” to curb the exports of Toyotas, Hondas and Nissans that were causing so much heartburn in Detroit. “Voluntary restraint agreements” were negotiated with 15 countries that accounted for 80 percent of American steel imports.  They were voluntary in the sense that foreign exporters preferred these agreements over the threat of punitive duties. In Washington, they were popular. As the Dartmouth College economist Douglas Irwin notes in his timely new book, “Clashing Over Commerce: A History of U.S. Trade Policy,” the share of American imports covered by some form of trade restriction rose to 21 percent in 1984, from only 8 percent in 1975.  Today, trade grievances are adjudicated differently: Since 1995, the United States has been required, like any other country, to take its complaints to the World Trade Organization’s dispute settlement system. It has lost some cases, especially those against Washington’s unique way of measuring dumping. But it tends to win when it brings a charge against some unfair practice abroad.",30.0,47.0

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)  LONDON (AP) — Silicon Valley is a uniquely American creation, the product of an entrepreneurial spirit and no-holds-barred capitalism that now drives many aspects of modern life.  But the likes of Facebook, Google and Apple are increasingly facing an uncomfortable truth: it is Europe’s culture of tougher oversight of companies, not America’s laissez-faire attitude, which could soon rule their industry as governments seek to combat fake news and prevent extremists from using the internet to fan the flames of hatred.  While the U.S. has largely relied on market forces to regulate content in a country where free speech is revered, European officials have shown they are willing to act. Germany recently passed a law imposing fines of up to 50 million euros ($59 million) on websites that don’t remove hate speech within 24 hours. British Prime Minister Theresa May wants companies to take down extremist material within two hours. And across the EU, Google has for years been obliged to remove search results if there is a legitimate complaint about the content’s veracity or relevance.  “I anticipate the EU will be where many of these issues get played out,” said Sarah T. Roberts, a professor of information studies at UCLA who has studied efforts to monitor and vet internet content. Objectionable content “is the biggest problem going forward. It’s no longer acceptable for the firms to say that they can’t do anything about it.”  How closely to manage the massive amounts of content on the internet has become a pressing question in the U.S. since it was revealed that Russian agencies took out thousands of ads on social media during the presidential campaign, reaching some 10 million people on Facebook alone.  That comes on top of the existing concerns about preventing extremist attacks. This month, three men were arrested after allegedly using smartphone messaging apps to plot attacks on the New York City subway and Times Square from their homes in Canada, Pakistan and the Philippines. The plot was thwarted by an undercover officer, not technology.  In some ways it goes to a question of identity. Social media companies see themselves not as publishers but as platforms for other people to share information, and have traditionally been cautious about taking down material.  But the pressure is on to act. Facebook, Google, Twitter and YouTube in June created the Global Internet Forum to Combat Terrorism, which says it is committed to developing new content detection technology, helping smaller companies combat extremism and promoting “counter-speech,” content meant to blunt the impact of extremist material.  Proponents of counter-speech argue that rather than trying to take down every Islamic State group post, internet companies and governments should do more to promote content that actively refutes extremist propaganda. This approach will unmask the extremist message of hate and violence in the “marketplace of ideas,” they argue, though critics see it as just another form of propaganda.  Facebook has recently published details of its counterterrorism strategy for the first time. These include using artificial intelligence to prevent extremist images and videos from being uploaded and algorithms to find and disable accounts linked to pages known to support extremist movements. The company also plans to increase the staff dedicated to reviewing complaints of objectionable material by more than 60 percent to some 8,000 worldwide.  “We want Facebook to be a hostile place for terrorists,” Monika Bickert, director of global policy management, and Brian Fishman, counterterrorism policy manager, said in a statement. “The challenge for online communities is the same as it is for real world communities - to get better at spotting the early signals before it’s too late.”  But Roberts argues the companies have been slow to react and are trying to play catch up.  The fact is the technology needed to detect and remove dangerous posts hasn’t kept up with the threat, experts say. Removing such material still requires judgment, and artificial intelligence is not yet good enough to determine the difference, for example, between an article about the so-called Islamic State and posts from the group itself.  In other words, taking down much of this material still needs human input, said Frank Pasquale, an expert in information law and changing technology at the University of Maryland. Acknowledging that is difficult for companies that were built by pushing the boundaries of technology.  “They don’t like to admit how primitive their technologies are; it defeats their whole narrative that they can save the world,” Pasquale said. “You kill off the golden goose if you cast doubt over the power of their algorithms.”  Employing enough people to fill in where the algorithms leave off would be a massive task given the volume of material posted on social media sites every day. Just imagine trying to moderate every puppy photo or birthday greeting, said Siva Vaidhyanathan, director of the Center for Media and Citizenship at the University of Virginia.  He believes that moderating content is ultimately impossible because you can’t create a system that works for everyone from Saudi Arabia to Sweden.  “The problem is the very idea of the social media system — it is ungovernable,” he said. “Facebook is designed as if we are nice to each other. And we’re not.”  The U.S. government response has been more focused on policing than regulation, with security services authorized to sweep up huge amounts of electronic data to help them identify violent extremists and thwart attacks. Beyond that, authorities have mostly relied on the market to drive change amid fears that heavy-handed regulation could interfere with the First Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens to speak out and exchange information.  European courts have had no such qualms, balancing freedom of expression against the right to privacy and community cohesion.  For example, the European Court of Justice in 2014 ruled that people have the “right to be forgotten,” permitting them to demand removal of personal data from search results when they can prove there’s no compelling reason for it to remain. As far back as 2000, a French court ordered Yahoo to prevent French internet users from buying Nazi memorabilia on its sites.  The European Union’s executive has been most active in matters of antitrust. This year it leveled a huge 2.4 billion euro ($2.8 billion) fine on Google and ordered it to change the way it does business, for example how it shows search results.  “There’s a real cultural divide,” said Edward Tenner, author of the upcoming book “The Efficiency Paradox: What Big Data Can’t Do.” ″European governments have been more committed to incorporating the ideas of social justice and the Americans have been much more on the libertarian side.”",80.0,122.0

The IRS has faced controversy for awarding Equifax a $7.25 million anti-fraud contract despite the fact that the company was embroiled in a data breach controversy.  According to Politico, Equifax was contracted “to verify the identities of taxpayers when they create accounts on its website,” however their current suspension “means that taxpayers will not be able to establish new accounts through a program called Secure Access, which grants them access to online records and transcripts.”  “The IRS plans to continue reviewing the security of Equifax’s systems during the suspension,” they continued, adding, “The agency had previously said its hands were tied and it had to keep the contract with Equifax.”  Several lawmakers had criticized the IRS’ decision to award Equifax a contract, including Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), Rep. Suzan DelBene (D-WA), and Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-OR), who claimed, “I was initially under the impression that my staff was sharing a copy of the Onion, until I realized this story was, in fact, true.”  In September, it was reported that Equifax had been the victim of a huge cyberattack, which left over 140 million consumers’ personal information vulnerable.  Following the attack, Equifax blamed the incident on a single employee who allegedly failed to implement a patch, despite the fact that, according to Tech Crunch, “a patch for that vulnerability had been available for months before the breach occurred.”  As previously reported:  The company faced further controversy following the discovery that Equifax’s Terms of Service included a clause in their security assistance website which barred consumers from being able to sue the company before they removed it following consumer backlash. It was also revealed that the company had been encouraging consumers to visit the wrong security website, a fake, which could have easily been used as a phishing scam and taken more information.

1470,3121,11,3,2017,2017-11-03,Vox,Thousands of heart patients get stents that may do more harm than good,"There’s an epidemic of unnecessary medical treatments, as David Epstein of ProPublica recently documented in a terrific investigation: Doctors routinely perform procedures that aren’t based on high-quality research, or even in spite of evidence that contradicts their use.  One of the prime examples of a dubious treatment that Epstein and others have pointed to is cardiologists putting little mesh tubes called stents in patients with stable angina — chest pain caused by clogged coronary arteries that arises only with physical exertion or emotional stress.  Doctors insert the devices into narrowed or blocked arteries to pop them open, helping blood flow to the heart again. The idea is that stents should help soothe the suffering of patients with angina (or chest pain) and drive down the risk of a heart attack and death in the future.  But studies show that stable angina can be well controlled with medication. And researchers have found that stenting chest pain patients doesn’t help them live longer or reduce their risk of disease — in fact, heart attacks and strokes can be potentially deadly side effects of stent procedures. There’s also been a lingering question about whether stents truly work to relieve pain.  Now, researchers from the United Kingdom have published a high-quality study in the Lancet that helps answer the pain question. Building on years of lower-quality evidence, the well-designed study suggests stents may in fact be useless for pain in people with stable angina who are being treated with medication.  ""Surprisingly, even though the stents improved blood supply, they didn't provide more relief of symptoms compared to drug treatments, at least in this patient group,"" said Rasha Al-Lamee, lead author of the study and a researcher at the National Heart and Lung Institute at Imperial College London, in a statement. This doesn’t mean stents should never be used in stable chest pain patients — some patients can’t take the medications that control angina, for example — but doctors may want to consider inserting these devices as a last resort.  Considering 500,000 patients get stents for stable angina each year in the US and Europe alone, and the devices can cost up to $67,000, depending on the hospital and a patient’s insurance coverage, the Lancet paper is poised to shake up cardiology, as the New York Times reported.  The trial is also important for another big reason: It raises critical questions about the quality of evidence doctors rely on to make life-and-death decisions for their patients.  The controversy over stents for patients with stable chest pain  Over the years, studies have been piling up that suggest stenting stable angina patients may not actually be all that helpful.  A decade ago, researchers published a study in the New England Journal of Medicine showing that stents did not improve patients’ mortality risk or cardiovascular disease outcomes. Since then, meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials on stents in stable angina patients have similarly found the devices don’t outperform more conservative medical therapies (such as medication) when it comes to preventing heart attacks or extending patients’ life expectancy in the long term.  There was still a question about using stents in stable patients, whether the devices could relieve chest pain in the shorter term. Data from low-quality studies suggested this was possible.  The only way to resolve the question would be to perform a double-blind “sham control” study of stents: giving half of the patients a fake stent and the other half a real stent, with both doctors and patients unaware of (or “blinded” to) which procedure they were involved with. Since we know medical procedures can produce a strong placebo effect, this kind of study could tease out whether it was the stent that was reducing patients’ pain or a placebo effect produced by the operation.  But no one had ever done a double-blind sham-control study — the gold standard of evidence for medical device studies — on stents in stable chest pain patients, until this new Lancet paper.  How researchers used a fake operation to test whether stenting works  The authors of the Lancet paper enrolled 230 patients with stable angina and at least one narrowed coronary vessel. For six weeks, they made sure the patients were getting the best medical treatment for angina, like beta blockers or long-acting nitroglycerine.  What came next rarely happens in medical device trials (and it’s why cardiologists are applauding this study): They gave half the patients a sham stent. So after the six-week startup phase, where patients were stabilized with medications, 195 of them were randomly assigned to get either a stent in their clogged artery or a sham stent procedure. The study was double-blinded — again, the patients and doctors didn’t know which procedure they were involved in — to reduce the risk of bias.  The doctors then followed up with their patients after another six weeks. The main outcome they were interested in was how much time each group could spend exercising on a treadmill, since angina often acts up with exertion. (They also looked at other secondary endpoints, such as changes in oxygen uptake and the severity of chest pain.) By the end of the study, the researchers found there were no clinically important differences between the real stent group and the sham stent group.  So actual stents didn’t outperform the placebo stents. “It’s just like a sugar pill,” said University of California San Francisco cardiologist Rita Redberg. “We know sugar pills make a lot of people feel better — though sugar procedures make even more people feel even better.”  Here’s the most disturbing part: One in 50 stent patients will experience serious complications — such as a heart attack, stroke, bleeding, or even death. So these devices don’t come without risks, and this Lancet paper again suggests they may not be helping patients.  “This should make us take a step back and ask questions about what we are accomplishing for this procedure,” said Yale cardiologist Harlan Krumholz.  David Brown, a Washington University School of Medicine cardiologist who has been studying the effects of stents for a decade, said he wasn’t surprised by the findings.  “[Stenting stable patients] is based on a simplistic 20th-century conceptualization of the disease,” he said. “It’s like the artery is a clogged pipe and if you relieve those blockages, the water will flow freely.” But this study suggests most patients’ pain symptoms may actually be coming from disease in their smaller blood vessels, not from blockages in the large coronary vessels that are always the targets for stents, he added.  In an editorial that accompanied the Lancet paper, Brown and Redberg wrote that medical guidelines need to change so that stenting for stable angina is only recommended as a last resort. “Patients should also be told that sham controlled trials don’t show any benefit,” Brown added.  This study speaks to a much bigger problem with medical evidence  The study represents the best available evidence on the impact of stenting for pain in stable angina patients — and could eventually avert unnecessary, costly procedures in the future. But the study is also important for what it says about the quality of medical evidence doctors often rely on to make decisions.  “This is a great example of a device that got on the market without ever having a high-quality trial behind it,” Redberg says. “For 40 years, we have been doing this procedure without any evidence that it’s better than a sham procedure.”  Right now, medical devices are less rigorously regulated than drugs: Only 1 percent of medical devices get FDA approval with high-quality clinical trials behind them. Even in these cases, devices typically reach the market based on data from a single small, short-term trial, Redberg wrote in a 2014 editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, where she called for a sham control study of stents.  The new Lancet study demonstrates why this kind of investigation is so critical in medicine. “The results of ORBITA show (once again) why regulatory agencies, the medical profession, and the public must demand high-quality studies before the approval and adoption of new therapies,” Redberg and Brown wrote in their recent editorial. Right now this isn’t happening. And stents surely aren’t the only device patients may be getting that are more placebo than proven, and have potentially deadly side effects.",3.0,7.0
478,1853,10,10,2017,2017-10-10,Associated Press News,"AP FACT CHECK: Trump’s empty boasts on legislation, economy","President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in the Oval Office of the White House, Tuesday, Oct. 10, 2017, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)  WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s latest recitation of his accomplishments is marked by empty boasts.  He’s not hitting new heights on economic growth compared with his predecessor. His legislative achievements are notably thin, even as he speaks of historic achievements with Congress. His contention that he’s trying to keep “Obamacare” afloat until it can be replaced stretches credulity.  And, no, Obamacare is not making life difficult for Henry Kissinger, as Trump implied.  Here’s a look at some of Trump’s statements in an interview with Forbes magazine and after sitting down Tuesday with Kissinger, the foreign policy maven:  TRUMP: “So GDP last quarter was 3.1 percent. Most of the folks that are in your business, and elsewhere, were saying that would not be hit for a long time. You know, Obama never hit the number.” — Forbes interview.  THE FACTS: Yes, Barack Obama did, repeatedly. Growth topped 3 percent in eight quarters during Obama’s presidency.  When Forbes pointed out that Obama had reached that benchmark, Trump amended his claim: “He never hit it on a yearly basis.”  That’s true. The economy never grew by more than 3 percent for a full calendar year under Obama. That hasn’t happened since 2005. It is unlikely to happen this year, either.  ___  TRUMP: “Now, we’re going to have to do something with Obamacare because it’s failing. Henry Kissinger does not want to pay 116 percent increase in his premiums, but that’s what’s happening.” — after meeting Kissinger.  THE FACTS: It is super safe to assume that Kissinger, 94, the former secretary of state and national security adviser, chairman of his own international consulting firm and prolific author, is not bothered by rising Obamacare premiums. It’s also against the law for an insurer to sell an Obamacare plan to someone who’s covered by Medicare.  It’s also unclear what Trump is referring to when he cites a 116 percent premium increase.  In Arizona this year, unsubsidized premiums for a hypothetical 27-year-old buying a benchmark Obamacare plan increased 116 percent, according to an earlier government estimate. That sticker price, however, could be reduced significantly with subsidies available to low- and moderate-income people.  ___  TRUMP: “I’ve had just about the most legislation passed of any president, in a nine-month period, that’s ever served. We had over 50 bills passed. I’m not talking about executive orders only, which are very important. I’m talking about bills.” — Forbes interview.  THE FACTS: He’s signed little of consequence into law, a thin record all the more striking because of the Republican majority in the House and Senate. His record pales not just next to Franklin Roosevelt’s but with Obama’s and others.  All presidents sign routine legislation. Trump is no exception. Among the more than 50 bills he’s enacted with his signature: legislation naming a Veterans Affairs health clinic in Butler County, Pennsylvania, after Bataan Death March survivor Abie Abraham, appointing a regent at the Smithsonian Institution, and naming a federal building and courthouse in Nashville, Tennessee, after late Sen. Fred Thompson.  He’s also signed emergency aid for hurricane victims.  The only far-reaching bill he’s signed is one he didn’t like but went along with, tightening sanctions on Russia and Iran. Meantime, his promised repeal and replacement of Obama’s health care law has yet to materialize after twice failing in Congress.  His proposed tax overhaul is in play, not in place, and the big-ticket infrastructure initiative he promised hasn’t come to Congress.  FDR, in contrast, pushed through more than a dozen historic laws in his first 100 days, never mind nine months, setting in place the pillars of his New Deal to combat the Depression. Obama signed an enormous stimulus package into law in his first month, while also succeeding in getting a law expanding health care for children and the Lilly Ledbetter bill on equal pay for women, also in 100 days.  ___  TRUMP on Obama’s health law: “What we’re doing is trying to keep it afloat, because it’s failing.” — Forbes interview.  THE FACTS: He’d like to sink Obamacare. Short of that, it’s true he has thrown at least a temporary lifeline to the health insurance markets set up under the law. Despite his threats to cut off payments to insurers that help reduce consumers’ copays and deductibles, his administration has continued making the payments month to month.  Yet his administration has announced sharp cuts in programs promoting health care enrollment under the law for next year.  Advertising will be cut from $100 million spent on 2017 sign-ups to $10 million, according to health officials. As well, money for consumer helpers called “navigators” will be cut about 40 percent. And the enrollment season for the subsidized individual-insurance market will be considerably shorter for 2018, running from Nov. 1-Dec. 15 this year.  ___  Associated Press writers Donna Cassata, Christopher S.

632,2031,10,15,2017,2017-10-15,Breitbart,"‘State of Denial’: Hillary Clinton Blames Nigel Farage, Macedonian Fake News Factories, for Losing Election","Continuing her British leg of the What Happened book tour, failed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton reiterated her favoured tropes of anti-Brexitism, Russian hackers, and ‘fake news’ to the BBC’s Andrew Marr, and deflected questions about her friendship with alleged rapist Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, her husband’s own alleged sexual predations, and whether her status as part of an elite lead to her election loss, blaming instead a conspiracy of Russian hackers and ‘possibly’ the Trump campaign.  Reading from her 512-page post mortem where she explains how she lost the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Marr quoted an excerpt where Clinton observed that voters “just didn’t like me” – but rather than reflectively acknowledging the loss was her responsibility, almost immediately she blamed “a concerted and effective campaign to tear me down”.  Descending into the Democrat’s favoured and familiar conspiracy theories, she claimed campaign staffer John Podesta’s emails were hacked by Russian intelligence, exposed by WikiLeaks, which she called a “mouthpiece for Russian authoritarianism”, and were “weaponised” and turned into “phony news stories” at fake news factories in Macedonia (a small, former Yugoslav nation of a population of less than one-quarter of London’s).  Claiming that “the Russians wanted to help Trump and hurt me”, she alleged Russian President Vladimir Putin had a “personal grudge” against her.  .@HillaryClinton says Brexit was a “precursor to what happened in the US” #marr pic.twitter.com/G9wSNM7EJp — The Andrew Marr Show (@MarrShow) October 15, 2017  Asked by Marr on Sunday if she thought the campaign of then-candidate Donald J. Trump colluded with Russia, she said: “We don’t know the answer to that. That is part of what is being explored.”  The globalist took another swipe at former UKIP leader Farage, accusing him of using the same “big lies” to get the president elected as those used to win the EU referendum. “I want to make another point about Brexit. Looking at Brexit, it was a precursor to what happened to us in the United States,” she said.  “You had Farage campaigning for Trump. The big lie is a very potent tool.”  Blasting the globalist former New York Senator, Brexit leader Nigel Farage told his LBC listeners Clinton needs to accept responsibility for her election loss.  “Hillary Clinton is in a state of denial, she’s making herself look, frankly, ridiculous,” Mr. Farage said.  “She blames the whole world. The Russians. The lies that were told in Brexit. Everything is the fault of other people, nothing is to do with her.”  You look ridiculous @HillaryClinton. The war is over for you. Move on. pic.twitter.com/kTa86ThMnw — Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) October 15, 2017  Mr. Farage, who suggested last week Clinton retitle her book “The Great Big Whinge”, added: “American voters were turned off by her sense of entitlement.  “I don’t think Hillary Clinton has much relevance. We should no more listen to Hillary Clinton than we listened to Barack Obama during the referendum campaign telling us not to vote for Brexit.”  Addressing the former U.S. Secretary of State directly, Farage said: “Hillary you lost. Move on. The war is over for you.”  Asked on the UK’s exit from the European Union and the impact of a ‘no deal’ scenario, she said it would be “a very big disadvantage to Britain,” where the UK “would not have as easy access to the European market that you’ve had under EU membership” – ignoring the fact that that European countries are also reliant on trade with the UK.  Clinton then mocked the prospective trade deal with the U.S. under President Trump, alleging “You’re making a trade deal with someone who doesn’t believe in trade,” despite the president pledging multiple times the UK would be at the front of the queue to sign a trade deal.  Describing “your friend Harvey Weinstein”, Marr asked the failed presidential candidate about her knowledge of the Hollywood mogul’s alleged predatory behaviour following multiple accusations of sexual misconduct, assault, and even rape by dozens of actresses including Cara Delevingne, Kate Beckinsale, and Ashley Judd.  Admitting the strong ties between herself, Weinstein, and the Democratic Party, she implied no knowledge of the misconduct before women came forward, stating: “I was shocked and appalled as I’ve known him through politics as many Democrats have. He’s been a funder, a supporter for all of us – for Obama, for me, for people who have run for office in the United States.”  She was quick to deflect away from her association by saying: “I think it’s important that we do not just focus on him… but that we recognise this behaviour cannot be tolerated anywhere,” not missing the opportunity to recall to viewers when the president apologised after a tape was released of Trump making lewd comments about women in 2005.  “After all, we have someone admitting to being a sexual assaulter in the Oval Office,” Clinton said, forgetting her own husband and former President Bill Clinton was accused of the alleged brutal rape of Juanita Broaddrick, sexual assault of Kathleen Willey, and sexual harassment of Paula Jones.  Marr picked up on this omission, noting that the Democrat has urged female victims of abuse to come forward, but “yet in your book three women brought onto the stage by Trump attacking your husband you dismissed them. Are you sure that is the right thing to do? Are you sure about that?”  “Well, yes because that had all been litigated,” Clinton defended, saying that “there were conclusions drawn and that was clearly in the past”.  Speaking to Breitbart News, Broaddrick said: “Harvey Weinstein and Bill Clinton are cut from the same cloth… They are both powerful men and had the ability to protect themselves from the rumours and whispers about their well known, deviant, and criminal behaviour.”  Twitter Follow @friedmanpress Follow Victoria Friedman on",13.0,16.0
1127,2706,10,28,2017,2017-10-28,Vox,Trump’s opioids declaration was missing one key thing: money,"President Donald Trump declared America’s opioid crisis a public health emergency on Thursday, after sending mixed signals on the issue for the past three months. But there’s one big thing missing: money.  Trump won’t direct any new federal money to the opioid crisis, per administration officials. The declaration will free up the federal Public Health Emergency Fund to be used to fight the drug epidemic, but Congress hasn’t replenished the fund in years. There’s just $57,000 left in it — and public health experts say a serious response to the addiction crisis would cost $183 billion over the next decade.  For public health officials, doctors, and treatment advocates on the ground in states hardest hit by the epidemic, the federal government — under both the Obama and Trump administrations — has been slow to respond to America’s deadliest drug crisis, which killed a record 64,000 Americans last year.  Trump’s Thursday declaration, though encouraging, wasn’t the decisive action that many were looking for.  “I think it was a step forward but it wasn’t the big step, because it does not bring new money,” said Tym Rourke, chair of the New Hampshire Governors Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery and a longtime treatment advocate in the state. New Hampshire has the second-highest rate of fatal drug overdoses in the nation, behind West Virginia.  “There are unmet needs right now that this declaration, while welcome, does not address,” Rourke said. “If we don’t get additional resources on the ground, there is only so much positive impact we can have.”  In West Virginia, where the death toll from heroin, fentanyl, and prescription opioids is the worst in the United States, public health officials say they want help from the federal government matching the scale of the devastation they see every day.  “People are dying out here,” said Michael Brumage, executive director of the Kanawha-Charleston Health Department in Charleston, West Virginia, in a recent interview. “We are having a Vietnam in America every single year from overdoses. If this is a war, why would we not apply the resources as we could?”  Brumage said he believes there’s a disconnect between government officials in Washington, DC, and people who are seeing the toll of the drug crisis play out every day in America’s communities.  “When you’re sitting in a position of power and you’re removed from the day-to-day misery of this epidemic, I believe it’s easy to dismiss,” he said. “I think at an intellectual level they see the numbers of deaths from overdoses, but they’re abstractions because they’re figures on a piece of paper.”  “The public health hurricane of our generation”  Hard-hit states like New Hampshire and West Virginia have already had mixed experiences with the government’s response to the opioid crisis: They’ve gotten much less help than states with lower death rates.  The 21st Century Cures Act, passed last year, included $1 billion to be dispersed among states for drug treatment. The bill’s intent was for more federal money to go to states with the highest per capita drug death rates.  But after the bill was signed into law by President Obama, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration changed the funding formula to take into account states with the biggest overall numbers of overdose deaths.  That meant more populous states like California, Florida, and Texas got the most money, even though their per capita death rates were much lower. New Hampshire, with the second-highest death rate in the nation, received about $6.2 million over two years. Texas, with the fourth-lowest per capita rate for drug fatalities in the US, received $27.4 million.  Michael Fraser, the executive director of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, called the 21st Century Cures Act money “the first down payment in what’s going to be a long term investment” fighting the crisis.  Trump’s declaration Thursday will do several things, including letting states shift federal funds dedicated for HIV to also deal with opioid addiction, allow the US Department of Health and Human Services dedicate more staff to the addiction crisis, and let patients use telemedicine to get medication-assisted treatment like methadone or buprenorphine.  Fraser says he’s optimistic the declaration will help federal agencies streamline their response to the crisis and work more efficiently with states. But it’s now up to Congress to appropriate more money to help combat the opioid epidemic.  Administration officials said Thursday that they expect Congress’s December spending bill to contain money for treatment, but gave no specific dollar amount. But any congressional response is likely to fall far short of what some experts believe is needed to solve the crisis: close to $183 billion.  “If you’re going to actually do something, you’re going to have to put down some serious capacity building money,” said Richard G. Frank, a health economics professor at Harvard Medical School who has written extensively on the cost of treating addiction.  Every bit of money from the state and federal governments is helpful, said Dr. Rahul Gupta, West Virginia’s state health commissioner. Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion helped 50,000 people in the state get drug treatment, and the state received $5.8 million from the federal government this year as part of the 21st Century Cures Act.  “This is the public health hurricane of our generation,” Rourke said. “We are running against the clock.”  The epidemic goes beyond deaths  Why is the epidemic so expensive? Because while drug overdose deaths are often what gets the most attention, treatment advocates, doctors, and public health officials say they are just the tip of the iceberg. The opioid crisis has turned into what Tufts University assistant professor Thomas Stopka called a “syndemic,” “multiple diseases feeding off each other.”  IV drug use, for example, led to rates of hepatitis C infections tripling nationwide from 2010 to 2015. If untreated, the virus can liver cancer or cirrhosis years later; there is a cure, but it costs tens of thousands of dollars, and many state Medicaid programs won’t cover it unless the patient’s liver is starting to fail.  In Kentucky, Dr. Jennifer Havens, a researcher at the University of Kentucky’s College of Medicine, says many of the drug users she sees who test positive for hepatitis C are young. And she describes the reaction she’s seen from many young drug users who test positive for hepatitis C as “complete and utter apathy,” because drug use and disease has become a part of daily life.  “We’ve had very few people that have been upset by the news,” Havens said. “It’s kind of inevitable, and now it’s kind of endemic.”  Beyond hepatitis C, many drug users develop abscesses and soft tissue infections from drug use. Some of these can be cleared up with antibiotics, but if infections become more serious and travel to the heart, a patient may need their heart valve replaced, a procedure that can cost between $100,000 to $200,000.  Then there’s the toll on children of addicted parents, including babies born dependent to drugs in the womb if their mothers are still using, and the thousands of children who have to go into foster care because their parents are dead from an overdose or can’t take care of them due to active drug use.  “This is an epidemic like no other because it touches every fabric of society,” said Gupta.  A 2016 report found that prescription opioid abuse alone was costing America $78.5 billion, including $20 billion in lost productivity, $28 billion in health care costs, $21.5 billion in overdose deaths, and another $7.7 billion in criminal justice costs.  “The cost is tremendous,” Gupta said. “It’s the Boeing 737 crashing every single day.”",5.0,3.0
1012,2571,10,24,2017,2017-10-24,Breitbart,Fourth Amazon Studios Executive Exits Company In One Month,"Following the firing of programming chief Roy Price, Amazon Studios has faced the departure of their fourth executive in four months as Conrad Riggs, the former head of unscripted entertainment, departs the company shortly after Joe Lewis, the former head of comedy and drama.  The Hollywood Reporter reports that Lewis, who was head of comedy anddrama at Amazon Studios has departed the company. Lewis will reportedly exit Amazon Studios with a producing deal while Sharon Tal Yguado, a former Fox International exec, will take over as head of scripted content at Amazon. Earlier this month, Amazon’s programming chief Roy Price left the company amidst sexual allegations from one of Amazon’s top producers.  Amazon Studios CEO Albert Cheng will be filling in for a Price on a temporary basis. Lewis leaving the company marks the fourth high ranking executive to depart Amazon in the past month after the departure of Price and former head of international at Amazon, Morgan Wandell who recently signed with Apple to head the same department.  Lewis has previously been accused of creating a conflict of interest at Amazon Studios after Lewis cast his fiance, Yara Martinez, in Amazon’s recent series, The Tick. Martinez’ role in the series was originally conceived as a male character that would appear as a guest star, following the pilot, the show was reworked and Martinez was cast with her role eventually being elevated to series regular. Martinez has also appeared in two other Amazon original shows, Alpha House and I Love Dick.  Amazon Studios has reportedly been put under pressure following failure to produce a breakout original show in the way that Netflix has with House of Cards and Stranger Things. Producer David E. Kelly who worked on Amazon’s original series Goliath starring Billy Bob Thornton has claimed that the company may be in trouble in terms of their creative department. “Their entertainment division is a bit of a gong show,” Kelley said in October. “They are in way over their heads.”  Conrad Riggs, Amazon Studios’ former head of unscripted entertainment, has also departed the company according to Variety. Riggs was a former producer on popular reality TV series Survivor and was instrumental in signing former Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson to Amazon’s series The Grand Tour. However, the new reality series failed to generate the same buzz that Clarkson’s Top Gear had and added to a number of other failed reality TV series masterminded by Riggs.  American Playboy: The Hugh Hefner Story and food series Eat the World With Emeril Lagasse also failed to gain much popularity. Much like Lewis, Riggs departed following the firing of Roy Price, Amazon has yet to announce who will be running the companies unscripted entertainment division.",3.0,6.0
1006,2565,10,26,2017,2017-10-26,Fox News,Child with cerebral palsy reportedly faces deportation after surgery,"A 10-year-old girl with cerebral palsy, who has lived in the U.S. since she was 3 months old, is facing deportation to Mexico after being discharged from a Corpus Christi, Texas, children’s hospital where she recently underwent gallbladder surgery.  Rosamaria Hernandez, who is undocumented, was transported to Driscoll Children’s Hospital on Tuesday and followed by Customs and Border Protection agents from a nearby immigration checkpoint, the Caller-Times reported.  The girl's adult cousin, who is a U.S. citizen, escorted her to the hospital, the paper reported.  A border patrol spokesman told the New York Daily News that the girl and her cousin “approached the primary inspection lane” at a border checkpoint east of Laredo, Texas. Due to her medical condition, “Border patrol agents escorted her and her cousin” to the hospital.  The New York Times reported that the agents waited outside her hospital room until she was released.  “Their orders are to process her,” Leticia Gonzalez, her San Antonio-based associate, told the paper. “At this point, our argument to (immigration agents) is. 'There is a doctor’s directive, why aren’t you following it?'”  The agency told the newspaper in a statement that the girl's situation does not make her exempt from enforcement of the law.  The statement reportedly said, “Per the immigration laws of the United States, once medically cleared she will be processed accordingly. The Mexican Consulate has been advised of the situation by Laredo Sector Border Patrol.”  The Times reported that family members said agents took the girl to a facility in San Antonio, 150 miles away from her home. The Times reported it was “rare, if not unheard-of, for a child already living in the United States to be arrested — particularly one with a serious medical condition.”  U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, said in a tweet that a sick 10-year-old girl should “not be a @dhsgov priority.”",15.0,15.0
534,1925,10,12,2017,2017-10-12,Fox News,AUSA 2017: This military ATV can 'think' and drive itself,"Robots will soon be serving alongside soldiers in the U.S. Army, but not the sort of humanoid robots seen in ""Terminator"" – these robots could be more like “thinking” ATVs.  The U.S. Army launched a revolutionary SMET initiative that aims to integrate robots into brigades.  While top brass walked the floors of AUSA exploring innovation for future combat in Washington D.C., in Georgia at Fort Benning, robot selection to join the troops is in an intense final week.  AUSA 2017: THIS NET MAKES US SPECIAL OPERATIONS VEHICLES 'DISAPPEAR'  Many companies had thrown their robots in the ring for selection to serve and the Army narrowed down those invited to the Benning phase that began back on Sept. 11 and is expected to conclude Oct. 14. The final four robots will be chosen and the Army will ask the companies to begin production.  The jungle drums at AUSA have it that the selected robots may be integrating and working alongside soldiers in brigade combat teams (BCTs) as soon as early next year.  Why enlist robots to join the infantry?  What will these robot “soldiers” be able to bring to the fight?  American soldiers are required to carry a great deal of weight on missions, as much as over 100 pounds of gear. The SMET robot will play a key role in lightening the load for soldiers.  The aim is for a SMET robot to be able to carry 1,000 pounds across more than 60 miles in 72 hours.  The robot needs to operate autonomously, but also be compatible with a human manning it. It needs to be smart enough to follow the soldiers as they move.  In doing so, it also needs to be able to manage the wide range of terrains – and often tough terrains – that U.S. soldiers travel through. Wherever a soldier goes, a SMET will ideally be able to go too.  The robot will therefore need to have the right balance of being big enough to carry at least 1,000 pounds, while small enough to navigate through narrow areas in between trees in a forest or jungle, for example.  Soldiers don’t always walk to their missions, they often fly. So the SMET should be able to join them and fit inside a helicopter or the slung load.  If soldiers are under attack, they can defend themselves, so perhaps the robot will be equipped with advanced sensors to process and understand the threat and armed with weaponry to defend itself and fellow human soldiers too.  PODCAST: LEARN HOW THIS SPECIAL FORCES GUY BUILT A FORMIDABLE BUSINESS FROM NOTHING  What else could it be used for?  SMET is not just about the strength in terms of weight it can carry, ideally SMET will also enhance power for soldiers. The Army has set the goal that while on the move, the robots need to be able to generate 11kW of power and 3 kW while stationary.  This requirement could produce promising new battery technology, new methods of power generation and new ways to use alternative fuels.  SMET may also have potential to perform other roles like patrolling. At a base, it could be deployed for perimeter security or running re-supply missions through dangerous areas to reduce the risk to soldiers.  Early SMETs have even established they could tow soldiers on skis and follow soldiers in jungles, neither of which are easy tasks.  PODCAST: WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO LEAD A GREEN BERET TEAM AND BATTLE BACK FROM THE IMPOSSIBLE? LISTEN TO THIS INCREDIBLY INSPIRING STORY  Adding brains to extreme off-roading ATVs  Autonomy is extremely difficult. Autonomy on a platform that can go where a soldier can go and can tackle off road and tough terrain is even more difficult.  Polaris makes popular ATVs that are driven throughout the states America for fun. But they also make vehicles for the Armed Forces and the ultra-light MRZRs have long been a US military favorite for their outstanding off-road mobility.  In fact, U.S. special operations forces and the wider military regularly rely on the advanced capabilities MRZR 2 and MRZR 4 for their work downrange.  The company teamed up with robot experts Applied Research Associates and Neya Systems to turn their wildly popular MRZR into the MRZR X – a smart MRZR that integrates advanced robotics so it can drive without a human at the wheel.  At AUSA, there was a steady stream of Army personnel looking to examine the MRZR-X – the company’s submission for SMET selection. Still under close wraps, only the MRZR that provides the basis of X was available.  AUSA 2017 IN PICTURES  The mysterious MRZR-X  So what can we expect the under-wraps MRZR-X can do? We can expect the smarts laid out in the Army requirements combined with the MRZR’s capabilities.  This SMET robot would have the SOF-grade MRZR feature of on-demand, advanced all-wheel drive. When more traction is needed, the vehicle already has the smarts to automatically engage all four wheels and return to two-wheels when appropriate.  Both variants also reach a max speed of around 60 miles per hour and sport engines that have 88 horsepower, designed for extreme performance in the toughest terrains. For ensure maximum agility, the ATVs are built with a low center of gravity. In part, this is achieved by cunning placement of key components like the engine. These capabilities will provide an advantage in the MRZR-X being able to travel wherever a Soldier goes.  The MRZR 2 already meets the SMET weight requirement. It can carry 1,000 pounds, while the MRZR 4 can carry an additional 500 pounds.  For the versatility of SMET manned or unmanned, the MRZR vehicles are already designed with keyless ignition, which makes it easy for a human to jump in and instantly go. The vehicles can also be endlessly adapted for different mission configurations and requirements.  One very important option the MRZR-X could bring to a war zone is the litter configuration. Theoretically, the MRZR-X could drive a team out of harm’s way by itself while carrying wounded soldiers and freeing up the driver to also help treat the wounded.

80,460,9,6,2017,2017-09-06,The New York Times,What Older Americans Stand to Lose if ‘Dreamers’ Are Deported,"“It destabilizes that work force,” said Robert Espinoza, vice president for policy at PHI, a group that advocates on behalf of personal care workers. “If you are seeing family members, children, neighbors being deported, threatened, and so on, the ability to be present on the job is undermined.”  The health care field’s reliance on immigrant labor makes it particularly vulnerable. According to census data Mr. Osterman analyzed, more than one-quarter of home health aides in 2015 were immigrants. The proportion in certain states is far higher, reaching nearly one-half in California and nearly two-thirds in New York.  The undoing of DACA may also herald the undoing of other programs that provide a steady source of immigrant labor in the health care sector. For example, the government can grant people from certain countries that have endured hardship, like natural disasters or civil wars, what it calls temporary protected status.  The overwhelming majority of workers granted that status hail from El Salvador, Honduras and Haiti, and many have flocked to low-paying health care professions as well.  “We know from surveys that T.P.S. recipients are highly represented in the work force in certain areas,” said Tom Jawetz, a vice president of the Center for American Progress, a think tank that favors more liberal immigration policies. “In particular, many — especially Haitians — work in home health care.”  The Trump administration has suggested it may not extend the program for Haitians when its most recent extension expires in January, raising questions about whether it will end the program for Hondurans and Salvadorans as well.  As a basic matter of economics, removing tens of thousands of workers from occupations that already suffer from a serious labor shortage — the Labor Department predicts that the country will need more than 1.25 million home health aides by 2024, up from about 900,000 in 2014 — generally has one unambiguous effect: driving up costs.",1.0,2.0
435,1780,10,9,2017,2017-10-09,Fox News,Federal judge strikes down tax-free housing for clergy,"A federal judge in Wisconsin has struck down as unconstitutional a law that gives clergy tax-free housing allowances, in a ruling that could have far-reaching ramifications for religious leaders who have fought for years to keep the substantial financial benefit.  Under the federal law passed in 1954, a ""minister of the gospel"" doesn't pay income taxes on compensation that is designated part of a housing allowance. The Freedom From Religion Foundation, based in Madison, argued that the law discriminates against secular employees.  The benefit saves clergy, including non-Christian religious leaders, $800 million a year in taxes, according to the latest estimate from the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.  Under the law, housing allowances paid as part of clergy salary can be subtracted from their taxable income. The Freedom from Religion Foundation argued that a clergy member can use the untaxed income to purchase a home, and then, in a practice known as ""double dipping,"" deduct interest paid on the mortgage and property taxes.  U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb ruled Friday that the exemption provides an unconstitutional benefit to religious persons and no one else, violating the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution.  ""In reaching this conclusion, I do not mean to imply that any particular minister is undeserving of the exemption or does not have a financial need for one,"" Crabb wrote. ""The important point is that many equally deserving secular employees (as well as other kinds of religious employees) could benefit from the exemption as well, but they must satisfy much more demanding requirements despite the lack of justification for the difference in treatment.""  Crabb also struck down the law in 2013, but the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the ruling, saying the co-presidents of the anti-religion group who challenged it didn't have standing to bring the lawsuit because they had never been denied the parsonage exemption.  So in 2015, Freedom from Religion's co-presidents requested the tax benefit and were rejected by the IRS, leading them to file a new lawsuit last year.  U.S. Department of Justice spokeswoman Lauren Ehrsam declined to comment Monday. The Justice Department was defending Treasury Department Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen, who were named in the lawsuit.  Annie Laurie Gaylor, co-president of the Freedom from Religion Foundation, heralded the victory and said she was confident it would survive challenges on appeal.  ""It's a huge ruling,"" Gaylor said. ""The last one created shockwaves and this one should really be creating them. ... I think everybody knows we're right, they just don't like changing the law.""  While Crabb ruled the law unconstitutional, she deferred taking action on granting relief, which could include an injunction to block the granting of the tax benefit. Crabb ordered both sides to make arguments by Oct. 30 on what remedies would be appropriate.  ___  Follow Scott Bauer on Twitter at https://twitter.com/sbauerAP",39.0,36.0

The Standard & Poor's rating agency cut China's credit rating on Thursday, Sept. 21, 2017 due to its rising debts, highlighting challenges faced by Communist leaders as they cope with slowing economic growth. (AP Photo/Andy Wong)  BEIJING (AP) — China’s Finance Ministry on Friday criticized the cut in the Standard & Poor’s rating agency’s credit rating on Chinese government borrowing as a “wrong decision” and said it ignores the country’s economic strength.  S&P announced the change Thursday, citing rising debt it said increased financial risk. The move added to warnings China’s debt burden might drag on economic growth or threaten the financial system. It followed a similar downgrade by Moody’s Investors Service in May.  The timing is awkward for the ruling Communist Party, which wants to project an image of stability ahead of a twice-a-decade congress next month at which President Xi Jinping is due to be named to a second five-year term as leader.  S&P followed its China downgrade a day later by cutting its credit rating for Hong Kong, citing risks posed by their close ties. The agency said Friday it was reducing its long-term rating on Hong Kong by one notch, to AA+ from AAA, reflecting potential spillover risks.  It said Hong Kong has a good economic outlook, sizable fiscal reserves and credible monetary policy, but that China’s downgrade is “exerting a negative impact” on Hong Kong because of “strong institutional and political ties” between them.  The Finance Ministry complained S&P ignored China’s stable economic growth and reform efforts. It noted official data showed the economy grew by 6.9 percent in the first half of 2017 over a year earlier and government revenue rose by nearly 10 percent.  “The Standard & Poor’s downgrade of China’s sovereign credit rating is a wrong decision,” the ministry said on its website. “This misreading neglects China’s good fundamentals and development potential.”  Total Chinese nongovernment debt rose last year to the equivalent of 257 percent of annual economic output, according to the Bank for International Settlements. That is unusually high for a developing country and up from 143 percent in 2008.  Communist leaders have cited reducing financial risk as a priority this year. They have launched initiatives to reduce debts owed by state companies, including by allowing banks to accept stock as repayment on loans. But private sector analysts say they are moving too slowly.  S&P lowered its rating on China’s sovereign debt by one notch from AA- to A+, still among its highest ratings.  “A prolonged period of strong credit growth has increased China’s economic and financial risks,” said S&P in a statement. That has supported economic growth but “also diminished financial stability to some extent.”  The downgrade could raise Beijing’s borrowing costs slightly but is more significant for its impact on investor sentiment.  “The new rating is still squarely investment grade — there is no real concern about the possibility of default,” said Mark Williams of Capital Economics in a report.  “However, credit continues to expand at a faster pace than output, which points to significant ongoing misallocation of resources,” said Williams. “State sector reforms have continued to disappoint and so the hidden risks on bank balance sheets have continued to build.”  Chinese economic growth fell from 14.2 percent in 2007 to 6.7 percent last year, though that still was among the world’s strongest.  The government is trying to make the economy more productive by giving market forces a bigger role. It is trying to shrink bloated industries such as steel and cement in which supply exceeds demand, which has depressed prices and led to financial losses.  Beijing is trying to steer the economy to slower, more sustainable growth based on domestic consumption instead of investment and exports. But growth has dipped faster than planners wanted, raising the risk of politically dangerous job losses. Beijing has responded by flooding the economy with credit.  Official efforts to rein in debt “could stabilize the trend of financial risk,” S&P said. “However, we foresee that credit growth in the next two to three years will remain at levels that will increase financial risks gradually.”",5.0,9.0

1582,3269,11,9,2017,2017-11-09,Associated Press News,"US and them: America, the elephant in room at climate talks","US and them: America, the elephant in room at climate talks  WASHINGTON (AP) — How’s this for awkward? The United States has a delegation at international climate talks in Bonn that will be telling other nations what they should do on an agreement that the president wants no part of.  President Donald Trump has promised to withdraw the U.S. from the 2015 Paris climate pact where nations set their own goals to reduce the emissions of heat-trapping gases, but because of legal technicalities America can’t get out until November of 2020.  “It’s like having a guest at a dinner party who complains about the food but stays anyway,” said Nigel Purvis, who worked climate issues in the State Department for Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush — and dealt with a similar situation.  In 2001 Purvis was a climate negotiator for the U.S. State Department when the new president, George W. Bush, had pulled out of a landmark global warming agreement the previous administration had championed.  The U.S. position is not just awkward, it’s potentially bad for the environment, scientists say.  Most of the Bonn meeting will be coming up with rules on how countries report emissions of heat-trapping gases and how transparent they are. The United States used to be the leading force in pushing for tougher rules and more openness, Purvis and other experts said. The rules probably won’t be as strong now, Purvis said.  “If it’s left to Chinese leadership, which is what’s left, you will have less transparency,” said Massachusetts Institute of Technology management professor Henry Jacoby, who co-founded the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change.  The United States government is becoming increasingly isolated on climate change. On Tuesday, the Syrian government, mired in war and the last United Nations country not to sign the Paris accord, announced it would sign the pact. That means the United States will be alone when it pulls out.  State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert responded to the Syrian decision by attacking its government. “If the government of Syria cared so much about what was put in the air, then it wouldn’t be gassing its own people,” she said.  In a not-so subtle jab at Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron plans a separate “One Planet Summit” in Paris to push his “Make Our Planet Great Again” agenda on Dec. 12, the anniversary date of the climate accord. He invited more than 100 world leaders to his event, but not Trump. Instead, he invited lower level U.S. diplomats.  “The rest of the world needs to get on and negotiate ... and treat the U.S. as more of an observer in the process and the U.S. should act that way,” said Greenpeace International Director Jennifer Morgan, who has been at these negotiations for more than 20 years.  That’s not what the U.S. plans.  As meetings started on Monday, U.S. negotiator Trigg Talley said, “The president has made clear that we will engage countries on energy and climate change related issues and we look forward to working with colleagues and partners to advance the work here over these two weeks and beyond.”  The administration is hosting a panel on “the clean and efficient use of fossil fuels and nuclear power,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah said Tuesday. “It is undeniable that fossil fuels will be used for the foreseeable future, and it is in everyone’s interest that they be efficient and clean.”  Of the major fossil fuels, coal is by far the biggest climate change culprit. In 2014, coal accounted for 46 percent of the globe’s carbon dioxide emissions, but was only 29 percent of its energy supply, according to the International Energy Agency.  Three U.S. governors, some mayors, corporate leaders and students will also be attending the Bonn talks.  “We have one major major player who is on the sidelines,” California Gov. Jerry Brown told The Associated Press. “The rest of us will do everything we can to keep advancing efforts and keep doing what is needed to reduce carbon emissions. There is no time to wait.”  Former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg announced Thursday he will spend $50 million to help non-United States countries move away from coal. Bloomberg, Brown and others on Saturday will unveil a report called “America’s Pledge” on how much the United States can do without the federal government.  At a “We’re Still In” event Thursday at the climate talks, James Brainard, mayor Carmel, Indiana, joined in criticizing the Trump climate policy, saying the U.S. will cut emissions regardless of the president.  “He talks about greatness a lot,” Brainard said. “Great countries keep their word when they sign agreements. Great countries care about the condition of the planet they are going to hand off to their children and grandchildren.”  If the U.S. remains out of the Paris accord and tries to dismantle President Obama’s initiatives to curb emissions, the Earth will warm by an additional one or two tenths of a degree, said Glen Peters, a Norwegian scientist who is part of the Global Carbon Project.  Scientists say that even a few tenths of a degree of warming can have dramatic impacts on ecosystems and even day-to-day life for people.  Purivs said “countries will be frustrated and resentful” toward the Trump administration at the negotiations. But he added: “Many nations will understand the rules of the Paris agreement are going to be more important and more durable than any U.S. administration and there will be a strong desire to get it right.”  ___  Frank Jordans in Berlin, Maria Murru in Rome and Matt Lee and Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this story.  ___  Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears .

634,2033,10,15,2017,2017-10-15,Vox,Study finds 75 percent of workplace harassment victims experienced retaliation when they spoke up,"Shame, fear, and cultural norms all allow sexual harassment to go underreported.  There is so much we don’t know, but there is research that tells us some specifics about the state of the problem and the factors that make it better or worse in different workplaces.  Harvey Weinstein’s long alleged history of sexually preying on actresses, journalists, and musicians — and then scaring them into silence — has spurred a deeply charged national conversation about sexual harassment in the workplace. As more women speak up about this issue, demanding something be done, there is a lack of clarity of what can be.  The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a government agency responsible for processing the sexual harassment complaints that do get reported, says nearly one-third of the 90,000 complaints received in 2015 included a harassment allegation — but the agency notes that that number is far too low to reflect reality. They also estimate that 75 percent of all workplace harassment incidents go unreported altogether.  In 2016, the EEOC released a comprehensive study of workplace harassment in the United States, which concluded that “anywhere from 25% to 85% of women report having experienced sexual harassment in the workplace.” It’s a strikingly wide gap, but one that is very substantial even in its most conservative estimate — statistically predicting one in four people are affected by workplace sexual harassment.  In this void of concrete empirical data, we pieced together reports, surveys, and studies to outline the state of workplace sexual harassment in the United States — and what can be done to address it.  1) Some industries are worse  Sexual harassment is not an industry-specific problem, but some environments are worse, according to Emily Martin, general counsel and vice president for workplace justice at the National Women’s Law Center:  In male-dominated industries like construction, where women are seen as interlopers, women experience high levels of harassment.  Service-based industries, in which employers rely on tips and customer approval, can also breed an environment of harassment. Reports have also indicated customer behavior can impact how supervisors treat their employees.  Women in low-wage jobs, like hotel cleaners or farm workers, experience high levels of harassment because they do not have bargaining power to push back.  “Part of what sexual harassment is is an expression of power and expression of hostility,” Martin said. “When there aren’t women there to do the job, some men think women can’t do the job. When there are fewer women in the workplace, they are more isolated in general.”  Unionized workforces often see women being paid more equally and earning higher wages, which could help foster a more open culture around harassment reporting — unionized workforces in general aim to offer workers protections that could make victims less fearful of coming forward. But that doesn’t make them void of this kind of issue.  While workplace sexual harassment is often discussed in terms of women, men also experience sexual harassment in the workplace. According to a Washington Post survey, 10 percent of men have experienced sexual harassment at work. According to the EEOC, reports of men experiencing workplace sexual assault have nearly doubled between 1990 and 2009, from 8 percent to 16 percent of all claims.  This could be a sign of more incidents among men, but also is largely indicative of a changing culture around reporting, in which more people feel comfortable coming forward.  2) 75 percent of harassment victims experienced retaliation when they spoke up  As the Weinstein case exemplifies, women often don’t come forward with their experiences out of fear of retaliation. These fears are very valid and well-founded.  “One 2003 study found that 75% of employees who spoke out against workplace mistreatment faced some form of retaliation,” the EEOC report found.  In Weinstein’s case, the Hollywood executive would threaten up-and-coming actresses’ careers if they did not engage with him, or place negative stories about them in the media to mire their names in scandal. These tactics aim to isolate and silence victims.  When people do come forward, Vox’s Anna North explained, it’s usually when others around them do — strength in numbers. Once some of Weinstein’s accusers came out, more followed.  Formal reporting is the “least common response” among men and woman who have experienced harassment in the workplace — “approximately 30% of individuals who experienced harassment talked with a supervisor, manager, or union representative,” the EEOC study said. It continued:  Unwanted physical touching was formally reported only 8% of the time; and sexually coercive behavior was reported by only 30% of the women who experienced it. ... Studies have found that 6% to 13% of individuals who experience harassment file a formal complaint. 63 That means that, on average, anywhere from 87% to 94% of individuals did not file a formal complaint.  A lot of this underreporting comes down to a fear of retaliation from the employers or colleagues. Victims often fear they won’t be believed, or will receive blame or be subject to professional retaliation — like being fired from their jobs.  3) When acts of “harassment” are specifically defined, more women report incidents  But there are also other factors that lead to underreporting.  Digging deeper into the numbers of people affected by workplace sexual harassment, the EEOC found that reports of incidents grew when the specific acts that count as harassment were more specifically defined in surveys.  In other words, when people were just asked outright if they had experienced sexual harassment at work, without the term being defined, one in four reported having experienced some form of harassment in the workplace.  But when specific acts of harassment were mentioned, like sexual coercion or crude jokes, 60 percent of women reported having experienced some form of sexual or gender harassment.  This indicates a lack of societal clarity around what constitutes harassment in the workplace — and what is brushed off as just uncomfortable encounters. The EEOC recommended sexual harassment trainings as an effective way to clarify those gray areas.  4) Those once-a-year sexual harassment seminars likely do nothing  Company sexual harassment training is easily mocked — and often brushed off in popular culture.  Even the EEOC admits its ineffectiveness:  “Much of the training done over the last 30 years has not worked as a prevention tool — it’s been too focused on simply avoiding legal liability,” its report says.  But there are innovations to anti-harassment programs that have seen some results, Martin says — namely in bystander training and tailoring programs to specific workplaces.  There is also an emphasis on middle managers, who are seen as the first line of defense against inappropriate behavior. One witness told the EEOC’s researchers:  If I had limited assets to improve the climate of any organization, I would invest ninety-five percent of them in middle managers. These are the people who make all of the difference in the day-to-day lives of organizations and people. When we train middle managers, we don’t just train them about how to spot and address problem behavior — we teach them empirically sound things to do and say when an employee seeks them out to discuss a problem.  None of this works, however, if there isn’t a clear message from the top that the company is invested in its employees and their well-being.  5) Sexual harassment costs companies millions  From the Weinstein events, as we saw with Fox News’s Roger Ailes and Bill O’Reilly, there is often institutional pressure to push allegations under the rug — the idea being that companies with a public face don’t want sexual harassment claims to go public because the alleged harasser is often a company star.  It’s why companies often process claims through mandatory confidential arbitration instead of an open court, and why so many cases allow for nondisclosure agreements.  These tactics can be effective in hiding the problem on two fronts: They keep victims feeling isolated, and at times like the only people affected, and they insulate the perpetrator. But the incentives might be backward.  “A superstar employee that is creating that toxic work environment is probably costing that company more than he or she is bringing in,” Martin says.  According to the EEOC, in 1994 the Merit Systems Protection Board, a federal agency that oversee the abuses targeting federal employees, conservatively estimated that “as a result of sexual harassment, job turnover ($24.7 million), sick leave ($14.9 million), and decreased individual ($93.7 million) and workgroup ($193.8) productivity had cost the government a total of $327.1 million.”  That’s in addition to settlements:  Since 2010, employers have paid out $698.7 million to employees alleging harassment through the Commission’s administrative enforcement prelitigation process alone. While we do not have strictly comparable cost data with respect to the various agencies of the federal government, we surmise it would likely be similar, given the diverse and varied nature of the federal workforce and its worksites.  It all goes to say that there are a lot of systems in place that prevent people from speaking up.  “Even if you are rich famous and powerful, you can feel isolated in these situations,” Martin said. “But if you are not rich and famous and powerful, you still have to get your paycheck because it’s between you and homelessness. There are good reasons why it’s hard for women to bring formal complaints in these situations.”",9.0,13.0

Former White House chief strategist and Breitbart News chief executive Steve Bannon reportedly remains very interested in recruiting Hawley in his war against the establishment, which includes Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY). McConnell reportedly first urged Hawley to run for the 2018 midterms.  Josh Holmes, McConnell’s former chief of staff, said that Hawley was one of the establishment Republicans’ first choices for the 2018 midterm election.  “He was our No. 1 recruit of the cycle,” Holmes charged. “We worked our tail off to recruit Josh Hawley.”  Now, McConnell’s top recruit, Josh Hawley, will not commit to voting for Mitch McConnell if elected to the Senate in 2018. Hawley’s spokesman, Scott Paradise, responded in an email questioning whether Hawley would back the McConnell.  “The Senate is broken and failing the people of Missouri,” Paradise wrote.  “Josh is running because he is not willing to tolerate the failure of the D.C. establishment any longer,” Paradise added. “He won’t tolerate Claire McCaskill’s failure. And he won’t tolerate Republican failure, either.”  Paradise did not respond to a followup as to whether Hawley considers McConnell part of the Washington establishment. Mitch McConnell, as Majority Leader, has failed twice to repeal and replace Obamacare, to pass a tax reform package, to confirm over 200 Trump executive and judicial nominees, and to fund a wall to secure the border.  Josh Holmes did not respond to a request for comment from Breitbart News regarding Hawley’s non-endorsement of Mitch McConnell.  President Donald Trump told reporters on Monday that he understands Bannon’s frustration with Senate Republicans.  “Steve is very committed. He’s a friend of mine, and he is very committed getting things passed,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday when asked about Bannon’s decision to challenge establishment Senate Republicans opposed to the president’s agenda.  “I’m not going to blame myself, to be honest; they aren’t getting the job done,” Trump added.  McConnell has come under fire from conservatives, including Tea Party Patriots’ Jenny Beth Martin, Ken Cuccinelli of the Senate Conservatives Fund, and FreedomWorks President Adam Brandon. The Tea Party Patriots, FreedomWorks, and the Senate Conservatives Fund called for Mitch McConnell and the rest of Senate leadership to resign over their failure to repeal Obamacare, confirm Trump’s executive and judicial nominees, and fund a border wall.  Establishment Republicans and their operatives continue to reportedly panic over Bannon’s recent strategy to line up a series of anti-establishment, populist candidates to challenge Republicans who have not pushed for Trump’s agenda. Bannon will reportedly primary every Senate Republican up for reelection in 2018 outside of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX). Bannon also met with many Republican mega donors who are frustrated by the establishment Republicans’ inability to pass the Trump agenda, or pass anything resembling a conservative agenda.  Andy Surabian, a former White House adviser and now a senior adviser to the pro-Trump super PAC Great America Alliance, said,“The Republican establishment is so hollow and lacking in ideas that they’re almost forced to try and latch onto our slate of populist-conservatives and call them their own to survive.”  Surabian added, “If the McConnell Industrial Complex inside the Beltway wants us to believe that these candidates are with Mitch, then they should tell us which of them are publicly aligning themselves under the McConnell flag and supporting him for majority leader.”  Surabian, who works with Bannon, called McConnell a “toxic substance in a Republican primary” and said that “candidates are flocking to be aligned with Bannon because they understand that the power in the Republican Party now lies in its America First, anti-establishment wing.”",10.0,11.0

Big Adventures!"" Formerly six boys and one girl, the new team will have three girls and four boys. (Mattel, Inc. via AP)  NEW YORK (AP) — Girls are finally getting a bigger role in Thomas the Tank Engine’s boy-dominated world.  Mattel, the toy maker that owns the Thomas brand, will add two female main characters to the “Thomas & Friends” TV series next year. Nia and Rebecca will appear in each episode and help fix the gender imbalance at the shed where Thomas and the other main characters live: Three of the seven engines at Tidmouth Sheds will be female, up from just one.  The gender shakeup is just one of the many changes coming to the 30-year-old show. Thomas visits real countries for the first time; the animation will move at a faster pace; there’s a new theme song; the characters will crack more jokes; and the narrator will be gone, replaced by the voice of Thomas.  It’s all an effort to shake Thomas’ stodgy image, compete with flashier preschool shows and fight a drop in toy sales. It’s a big risk for the franchise, which got its start as a book series more than 70 years ago. To avoid any missteps, Mattel consulted with parents, young fans and even the United Nations. In all, the company spent two years working on the makeover.  “It’s such a huge shift,” said Kate Schlomann, a vice president of branding at Mattel. “We want to make sure we’re here another 70 years.”  Girls are finally getting a bigger role in Thomas the Tank Engine’s boy-dominated world. The gender shakeup is just one of the many changes coming to the 30-year-old show to shake Thomas’ stodgy image and fight a drop in toy sales. (Oct. 14)  Nia, an engine from Kenya, will make her debut next summer in the movie “Big World! Big Adventures!” and then join the TV series in the fall. Experts at the U.N. advised producers with Nia’s name (it means “purpose” in Swahili) and helped select the African pattern that runs across Nia’s body.  “When you’re designing an engine from any country, you want to be spot on,” said Schlomann.  Rebecca’s origins are less exotic. She’ll come from the Mainland near Thomas’ fictional island of Sodor. She’ll first appear on screens in the TV series next fall. Henry and Edward will get the boot from Tidmouth Sheds to make room for the two new girls, but the boy engines will still appear on the show from time to time. (Mattel refers to the characters as girls and boys, even though they are engines.) Producers wanted Nia and Rebecca to have starring roles, and they’ll join Emily, who has been the only girl engine among the crew of main characters for about 13 years. Other girls in Thomas’ universe have had smaller roles.  “We have added new female characters before, but I think, with a show like Thomas, they tend to fall into the background after initial introduction,” said Ian McCue, a “Thomas & Friends” producer. “What we wanted to do here was really bring these two female characters to the forefront.”  Thomas will meet other female characters, such as an airplane in Australia. And in India, there’s a female train controller in charge of the railway, another first for the show, Mattel said.  “Gender equality is something that’s really important to us in this new series and going forward,” said producer Micaela Winter.  Viewership of “Thomas & Friends” is evenly split between girls and boys, Mattel said, and girls are more likely than boys to watch every week. But the brand hasn’t catered to them. Girls will be in more Thomas toy commercials and on the box. Nia toys will be on sale next fall after the movie release, and Rebecca toys will follow in 2019. More T-shirts, pajamas and bed sheets will be aimed at girls.  “I think it’s actually giving them what they want,” said Schlomann.  Mattel has made changes to its other toy brands in an attempt to be more inclusive and appeal to today’s parents. Barbie and Ken dolls now come in different skin colors, body shapes and hair types. And the first boy doll was added to the American Girl lineup earlier this year.  Mattel took control of “Thomas & Friends” five years ago, after it bought production company Hit Entertainment for $680 million. Since then, it has tried to put its stamp on the brand. Engines from India and China, for example, rode into Sodor last year to add some diversity and appeal to viewers who live in the 110 countries that watch “Thomas & Friends.”  But Thomas has big competition from shows on Disney Junior and Nick Jr., whose characters are also in toy stores with Thomas. Mattel said in July that second-quarter sales at its Fisher-Price unit, which Thomas is a part of, slipped 3 percent compared to the same period the year before. “Our Thomas business remains challenged,” said Mattel Inc. Chief Operating Officer Richard Dickson in a July conference call with investors. But he said there were a couple of new opportunities for the franchise, including girls.  As for Thomas, Mattel said it was fans who wanted the blue engine to get out of Sodor more often.  “One was a little boy saying, ‘Trains can go anywhere, but Thomas never goes anywhere,’” said McCue. “That really got us thinking.”  Thomas will spend half of the 26 TV episodes on railroads in other countries, such as Australia and China. Producers and writers met with the U.N., which has an office that works with movie and TV productions, to help represent different cultures, such as when Thomas takes part in the Chinese New Year.  “It’s really about learning about the world and bringing the world into the living room for a preschooler,” said Schlomann. “Which we haven’t done before.”  _____  Associated Press video journalist James Brooks in London contributed to this report.  _____  Contact Joseph Pisani at http://twitter.com/josephpisani",48.0,68.0

The event takes place on the anniversary of the election that put Trump in the White House. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya)  DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Marking a year since President Donald Trump’s election, his fiercest advocates offered different approaches Wednesday for the Republican Party’s way forward after some tough losses Tuesday.  Appearing in key states Trump carried a year ago, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer and Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel called on Republicans to come together, while former White House strategist Steve Bannon maintained an aggressive tone toward any in the GOP who would stand in the president’s way.  Their remarks in Iowa and Michigan underscored the tension bubbling over in Washington.  “Let me tell you, there is a stark difference between the worst Republican and the best Democrat,” Spicer said during the Republican Party of Iowa’s annual Reagan Dinner in Des Moines.  Spicer lamented Republicans in Virginia who decided not to vote Tuesday for GOP gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie because he didn’t pass their “litmus tests.”  Bannon, meanwhile, took aim at veteran Republican lawmakers and entrenched party insiders, whom he has pledged to root out of the Senate next year. He grouped Gillespie — a lobbyist, former RNC chairman and adviser to former President George W. Bush — with the GOP forces of old.  Trump needs more outsiders at his side, Bannon said.  “He’s had some victories. He’s had some defeats,” Bannon said of Trump. “Most of the defeats are because the Republican establishment cannot execute on the plan.”  Bannon spoke at a Republican dinner in Macomb County, Michigan, a working-class Detroit suburb which former President Barack Obama carried twice but where Trump handily beat Democrat Hillary Clinton last year.  Despite Trump’s low approval ratings — 33 percent in a Gallup poll this week, the lowest of his presidency — McDaniel, who also spoke at the Iowa banquet, painted an optimistic picture of the economy, touted record party fundraising and said, “I feel very confident in the candidates I see running across the country.”  “I hope we expand our majority in the Senate so we can get more things done,” she said.  However, Bannon has pledged to find primary opponents for virtually every Republican senator standing for re-election next year, arguing they have not adequately defended Trump against attacks from within his own party, chiefly by Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker and Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake.  With Corker and Flake having announced plans to not seek re-election, Bannon is gunning for GOP Sen. Dean Heller in Nevada and has even mentioned challenging reliable conservatives such as John Barrasso of Wyoming and Deb Fischer of Nebraska.  One of Bannon’s chief goals is ousting Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, whom he blames for not following through on long-promised legislation to undo Obama’s 2010 health care law.  “They only understand one thing. You cannot be nice to these guys,” Bannon said, referring to McConnell. “You have to drop the hammer. That’s what he understands.”  ___  Eggert reported from Warren, Michigan.",3.0,3.0
1529,3197,11,8,2017,2017-11-08,Fox News,Facebook says it needs your explicit photos to combat revenge porn,"Worried that an ex-boyfriend or girlfriend might post your intimate photos on the internet? Facebook says it has a solution – as long as you’ll hand over the photos first.  The social media giant recently announced its new plan to combat “revenge porn,” when individuals post nude photos online without the consent of the subject.  The initiative may seem trivial, but according to a 2016 study by Data & Society, nearly 10 percent of women under the age of 30 have fallen victim to “revenge porn” or have had someone threaten to post their explicit photos online.  SNAPCHAT IS GETTING A NEW LOOK BECAUSE ITS 'TOO HARD TO USE'  Facebook’s new plan promises to stop these types of posts by archiving digital copies of submitted photos and using image-matching technology to prevent any future uploads of them, The Washington Post reported.  The company will test launch the program in Australia by partnering with the Office of the eSafety Commissioner, a government agency “committed to helping young people have safe, positive experiences online.”  The pilot program allows worried users to complete an online form on the eSafety Commissioner’s official website, detailing the specifics of their concern. The user will then send themselves the photo on Facebook Messenger, while the eSafety Commissioner’s officer notifies Facebook. Finally, the company’s community operations team will “source and hash” the image to prevent any future uploads or shares, a Facebook spokesperson explained.  “It would be like sending yourself your image in email, but obviously this is a much safer, secure end-to-end way of sending the image without sending it through the ether,” Australia’s eSafety commissioner, Inman Grant, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. “They’re not storing the image, they’re storing the link and using artificial intelligence and other photo-matching technologies.”  But there is a catch.  According to reports from The Verge, even if a nude photo is submitted to the company, Facebook's technology can only protect the user if the photo’s original file is uploaded - copies of the photo could be more difficult to stop.  NASA IS WORKING WITH UBER ON FLYING TAXIS  Digital forensics expert Lesley Carhart emphasized the complexity of completely deleting a digital file.  “Yes, they’re not storing a copy, but the image is still being transmitted and processed, leaving forensic evidence in memory and potentially on disk.” Carhart told The Post.  But Facebook says that the technology is trustworthy.  A company spokesperson added that the innovative technology was developed with global safety experts, in order to help Facebook provide a supportive and inclusive environment.  Privacy & Sexual Consent lawyer Carrie Goldberg agrees and is “delighted” by Facebook’s initiative.  “With its billions of users, Facebook is one place where many offenders aggress because they can maximize the harm by broadcasting the nonconsensual porn to those most close to the victim,” Goldberg said to the Guardian. “So this is impactful.”  At the end of its most recent quarter, Facebook had 2.07 billion monthly active users.  After piloting in Australia, Facebook plans to test the program in the United States, Britain and Canada.",2.0,1.0
102,576,9,7,2017,2017-09-07,The New York Times,European Central Bank Signals End of Cheap Money Era is Coming," Europe has taken a small step in its long march toward economic normalcy.  The European Central Bank said on Thursday that it had pondered how to wind down its easy money policies, an enormous stimulus program aimed at promoting growth and inflation in the eurozone. But the bank also postponed a decision on when it would actually do so, and will likely decide at least some of the details at its next meeting in October, the bank’s president, Mario Draghi, said.  Even though the eurozone is arguably in its best economic shape in a decade, Mr. Draghi and his colleagues on the bank’s Governing Council have been exceedingly cautious about ending the emergency measures that helped prevent the euro from self-destructing after the global financial meltdown in 2008.  The Federal Reserve in the United States began raising interest rates at the end of 2015, but the European Central Bank continues to flood the 19-nation eurozone with cash as a way to reduce interest rates, stimulate growth and nudge inflation from levels considered to be dangerously low. The measures have worked, for the most part, helping the region overcome a prolonged slump.  But the program — known as quantitative easing — has also had side effects, including fueling a steep rise in real estate prices in Germany that have led to fears of a bubble.",2.0,2.0

Infotainment technology automakers are cramming into the dashboard of new vehicles is making drivers take their eyes off the road and hands off the wheel for dangerously long periods of time, a study being released by AAA on Oct. 5 says. (AP Photo/Bill Gorman)  WASHINGTON (AP) — The infotainment technology that automakers are cramming into the dashboard of new vehicles is making drivers take their eyes off the road and hands off the wheel for dangerously long periods of time, an AAA study says.  The study released Thursday is the latest by University of Utah professor David Strayer, who has been examining the impact of infotainment systems on safety for AAA’s Foundation for Traffic Safety since 2013. Past studies also identified problems, but Strayer said the “explosion of technology” has made things worse.  Automakers now include more infotainment options to allow drivers to use social media, email and text. The technology is also becoming more complicated to use. Cars used to have a few buttons and knobs. Some vehicles now have as many as 50 buttons on the steering wheel and dashboard that are multi-functional. There are touch screens, voice commands, writing pads, heads-up displays on windshields and mirrors and 3-D computer-generated images.  “It’s adding more and more layers of complexity and information at drivers’ fingertips without often considering whether it’s a good idea to put it at their fingertips,” Strayer said. That complexity increases the overall amount of time drivers spend trying to use the systems.  The auto industry says the new systems are better alternatives for drivers than mobile phones and navigation devices that were not designed to be used while driving.  The vehicle-integrated systems “are designed to be used in the driving environment and require driver attention that is comparable to tuning the radio or adjusting climate controls, which have always been considered baseline acceptable behaviors while driving,” said Wade Newton, a spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers.  But Jake Nelson, AAA’s director for traffic safety advocacy and research, said drivers testing all 30 of the 2017 model year cars and light trucks took their eyes off the road and hands off the wheel while using infotainment systems. The test drivers used voice commands, touch screens and other interactive technologies to make calls, send texts, tune the radio or program navigation all while driving.  Clearly automakers haven’t worked hard enough to make the systems quick and easy to use, Nelson said. Researchers rated 23 of the 30 vehicles “very high” or “high” in terms of the attention they demanded from drivers. Seven were rated “moderate.” None required a low amount of attention to use.  Programming a destination into in-vehicle GPS navigation systems was the most distracting activity, taking drivers an average of 40 seconds to complete the task. At 25 mph (40 kph), a car can travel the length of four football fields during the time it takes to enter a destination. Previous research has shown that drivers who remove their eyes from the road for just two seconds double their risk for a crash.  Under pressure from industry, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 2012 issued voluntary safety guidelines to automakers for dashboard technology instead of enforceable safety standards. The guidelines recommend that automakers lock out the ability to program navigation systems while a car is moving. However, the ability to program navigation while driving was available in 12 vehicles in the study.  The guidelines also recommend automakers prevent drivers from texting while driving, but three-quarters of the vehicles tested permit drivers to text while the car is moving. Texting was the second-most distracting task performed by test drivers.  Drivers looked away from the road less when using voice commands, but that safety benefit was offset by the increased amount of time drivers spent interacting with the systems.  AAA said drivers should use infotainment technologies “only for legitimate emergencies or urgent, driving-related purposes.” It also urged automakers to block the ability to program navigation systems or send texts while driving. Automakers should also design infotainment systems so that they require no more attention to use than listening to the radio or an audiobook, it said.  Nearly 70 percent of U.S. adults say they want the new technologies in their vehicles, but only 24 percent feel that the technology already works perfectly, according to an opinion survey conducted for AAA.  “Drivers want technology that is safe and easy to use,” said Marshall Doney, AAA’s president and CEO, “but many of the features added to infotainment systems today have resulted in overly complex and sometimes frustrating user experiences for drivers.”  ___  Follow Joan Lowy on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/AP_Joan_Lowy",24.0,33.0

Long-haul carrier Emirates says it is starting new screening procedures for U.S.-bound passengers following it receiving ""new security guidelines"" from American authorities. (AP Photo/Adam Schreck, File)  DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — New security screenings for all passengers on U.S.-bound flights began on Thursday, with airlines worldwide questioning flyers about their trip and their luggage in the latest Trump administration decision affecting global travel.  However, confusion still remains about the new regulations, which come at the end of a 120-day period following the United States lifting a ban on laptops in airplane cabins affecting 10 Mideast cities. The new regulations cover all the 2,100 flights from around the world entering the U.S. on any given day.  Some airlines said they had received permission to delay implementing the new rules until January.  At Dubai International Airport, the world’s busiest for international travel, long-haul carrier Emirates began questioning passengers about their luggage, liquids they were carrying and where they were coming from. Passengers also had to have their carry-on bags searched, along with their electronics.  Emirates declined to discuss the new procedures in detail on Thursday. On Wednesday, it said it would conduct “passenger pre-screening interviews” for those traveling on U.S.-bound flights in concert with other checks on electronics.  Elsewhere, things did not appear to be going so smoothly. In China, an official in the Xiamen Airlines press office, who would only give his surname as Qiu, said that the airlines received a “demand” about the new U.S. regulations and planned “to take some security measures, including security safety interviews from today on.”  “We’re not going to interview all passengers, but focus on those with a certain degree of risk when checking the passengers’ documents on the ground,” he said, without elaborating.  An official with the Eastern Airlines publicity department said that she saw media reports about security safety interviews but didn’t have immediate details on what her company was doing. An official at the Beijing Airport press center would only say: “We always strictly follow relevant regulations of the Civil Aviation Administration when conducting security checks.” Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity under regulations.  At Air China, the country’s flag carrier, an official who only gave his surname, Zhang, said it would comply.  “We will meet the demands from the U.S. side, but as for the detailed measures (we will take), it is inconvenient for us to release,” he said.  South Korea’s Transport Ministry said that the United States agreed to delay implementing the new screening for the country’s two biggest carriers, Korean Air Lines Co. and Asiana Airlines Inc., until next year on condition they deploy staff at boarding gates to monitor travelers.  Royal Jordanian, based in Amman, also has said it would introduce the new procedures in mid-January.  Other airlines with U.S.-bound flights at Seoul’s Incheon International Airport brought in as many as seven extra staff Thursday to question passengers under the new rules but there were no major delays, airport spokesman Lee Jung-hoon said.  Singapore Airlines passengers may be required to “undergo enhanced security measures” including inspection of personal electronic devices “as well as security questioning during check-in and boarding,” the carrier said on its website.  Other carriers who announced the new regulations on Wednesday included Air France, Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., the airlines of Germany’s Lufthansa Group and EgyptAir.  In Hong Kong, passengers described some of the questions they were asked.  “They asked me if I packed my own bag, where I packed it from, where I came from, they looked at my itinerary, verify where I was, who I was, from where I came from,” said Fran Young, who was travelling to Los Angeles.  Some showed displeasure.  “It’s a little inconvenient, I kind of just want to get my printed ticket and then just go inside,” passenger Gavin Lai said. “I don’t want to wait on people to interview me like that. So it’s a little annoying.”  U.S. carriers also will be affected by the new rules. Delta Air Lines said it was telling passengers traveling to the U.S. to arrive at the airport at least three hours before their flight and allow extra time to get through security. United declined to comment, while American did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  In March, U.S. officials introduced the laptop ban in the cabins of some Mideast airlines over concerns Islamic State fighters and other extremists could hide bombs inside of them. The ban was lifted after those airlines began using devices like CT scanners to examine electronics before passengers boarded planes heading to the U.S. Some also increasingly swab passengers’ hands to check for explosive residue.  The laptop ban as well as travel bans affecting predominantly Muslim countries have hurt Mideast airlines. Emirates, the region’s biggest, said it slashed 20 percent of its flights to the U.S. in the wake of the restrictions.  ___  Associated Press writers Yu Bing in Beijing, Kelvin Chan and Josie Wong in Hong Kong, Anna Johnson in Phoenix and Youkyung Lee in Seoul contributed to this report.  ___  Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellap .

895,2386,10,22,2017,2017-10-22,Breitbart,Doug Jones Headed Soros-Funded Project To Transform Federal Prosecutors Into Social Justice Warriors,"NEW YORK –Doug Jones, the Democratic candidate for December’s Senate special election in Alabama, spearheaded an effort on behalf of a legal group massively funded by billionaire George Soros that sought to fundamentally transform the role of U.S. Attorneys from one of prosecuting criminals to activists that enact a so-called progressive criminal justice agenda.  Among other things, Jones’ project called on federal prosecutors to reduce or avoid sentences for drug offenders, make decisions about seeking jail time on individual cases based upon federal incarceration levels and use their pulpits to “spread change” and work with outside “community organizations” to root out the “causes of violence.”  One section of the report seeks to put U.S. Attorneys in the role of social justice warriors who go to schools to preach against “bullying,” coach Little League teams and mentor at risk youths. All this while working to “develop solutions to problems that do not involve prosecutions, such as mediating disputes and participating in school intervention programs.”  Jones is running against Republican challenger Roy Moore, whose victory in the GOP primary against establishment-backed candidate Luther Strange has been seen nationwide as a stunning electoral victory for Trumpian nationalist policies that promote the working class. Jones was previously appointed by President Bill Clinton to serve as U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama.  Jones’ Soros-Funded Report  The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School is a liberal policy institute that says it “focuses on the fundamental issues of democracy and justice.” It has been the recipient of numerous grants from Soros’s Open Society Foundations totaling over $7,466,000 from 2000 to 2010 alone.  In 2014, the Soros-funded Brennan Center released a 69-page document titled, “Federal Prosecution for the 21st Century,” which was the culmination of a Brennan Center project led by Jones.  The report was specifically based on the results of a Brennon Center initiative co-chaired by Jones calling itself the Blue Ribbon Panel that convened “criminal justice experts, including leaders in law enforcement, prosecutors and public defenders, former government officials, and federal grant recipients, to provide comments on the performance measures” and form the basis of the recommendations in the report.  Jones served as co-chair of the Blue Ribbon Panel and he also wrote the introduction to the report. His name is listed on the cover of the Brennan document.  The report itself acknowledges the support of Soros’s Open Society Foundations to the Brennon Center’s Justice Program, which sponsored the initiative spearheaded by Jones.  The report was launched at a September 23, 2013 conference keynoted by then-Attorney General Eric Holder and titled, “Shifting Law Enforcement Goals to Reduce Mass Incarceration.” In his opening remarks, Holder singled out Jones for co-chairing the Brennan Center’s Blue Ribbon Panel.  Jones: Federal Prosecutors Can Create ‘Change’  In his introduction, Jones laments that when he and his colleagues on the panel served as prosecutors, “there was an underlying drive to focus almost exclusively on the enforcement of federal laws without engaging in crime prevention.”  “Federal prosecutors have many tools to create this change,” Jones wrote. “They can use their resources to change prosecutorial practices; their bully pulpit and convening power to change hearts and minds; and their leverage in hiring young prosecutors to pick not only the best and the brightest, but also those with a nuanced view of justice.”  Jones used language reminiscent of the Obama administration’s infamous interagency memos that enacted “prosecutorial discretion” – which was widely regarded as de facto amnesty – when it came to bringing charges against young illegal aliens. Jones wrote that the report’s recommendations “encourage prosecutors to keep in mind the larger purposes of the justice system when recommending sentences, choosing what charges to bring and whom to prosecute, and deciding the terms of plea negotiations.”  The report itself goes on to recommend that “given their enormous power and discretion over charging and sentencing decisions, U.S. Attorneys possess a unique lever to spread change.”  The report states: “Prosecutors are well-positioned to create opportunities to improve public safety while also reducing the nation’s incarceration footprint. They are granted unique authority to make charging decisions, enter cooperation agreements, accept pleas and frequently dictate sentences or sentencing ranges.”  Sentence Recommendations Based on Incarceration Rates  When it comes to prosecuting crime, U.S. Attorneys were urged to “change perceptions that longer sentences are always better.”  One radical recommendation entailed having the prosecutor make decisions about an individual case based upon the total number of federal prisoners that originated from the prosecutor’s district:  A second success measure would focus on the number of total federal prisoners that originated from the district overall, and how that number fluctuates over time. This measure allows the district to determine whether it is increasing or decreasing its prison population over time. It also allows a district to discern how it fares against other districts. Notably, the size of the prison population is affected not only by the number of sentences to prison but also by the length of sentences of these prisoners. Therefore, this second measure captures broader information than the first measure. This second measure can also influence decisions prosecutors make in their cases, encouraging them to reduce charges or recommend whenever appropriate for less (or even no) incarceration time.  Letting Drug Offenders Off the Hook  A key goal of the report was to push reduced sentencing for drug offenders. This has also been a major policy aim for Soros. His Open Society Foundations gave a whopping $50 million to the New York-based Drug Policy Alliance, which seeks to decriminalize drug offenses. The Alliance’s main aim, according to its website, is to create a world in which people “are no longer punished for what they put into their own bodies but only for crimes committed against others.”  The Jones-led report opines that “shifting prosecutorial priorities to include focusing on reducing the numbers of people sent to prisons could have a dramatic impact. Not accepting certain types of drug cases, altering charging decisions or recommending diversion or alternative sentences for drug offenders would reduce the number of drug offenders entering the Federal Bureau of Prisons and are well within a prosecutor’s discretion.”  It recommends considering an “alternative sanction” for drug offenders in lieu of prison. “Rigorous studies have shown that drug treatment programs and close supervision, such as federal probation, can both reduce recidivism rates and costs,” the report added.  Social Justice Warriors  The report presents the case for U.S. Attorneys to work with outside organizations to root out the “causes of violence.”  Many U.S. Attorneys at the Blue Ribbon Panel said, with great force and conviction, that they thought preventing violent crime ought to be a priority for U.S. Attorneys’ Offices. … These attorneys recognized the need to move from a standard “enforcement” model of prosecuting those who commit violent crimes — such as firearms offenses, high-level narcotics trafficking, gang activity or bombings — to one of trying to reduce or eliminate the causes of violence. Emphasizing the joint sentiment of other U.S. Attorneys not present at the event, panelists suggested that a new model requires working with community organizations, faith-based organizations, youth groups, those with prior criminal justice contacts and schools to identify and address the issues which drive the problem of violence.  It urged outreach activities, which can include “participating in town hall meetings, partnering with schools, developing relationships with churches and faith-based organizations and engaging with underrepresented populations, such as Native Americans and many urban neighborhoods.”  The report documented that some members of Jones’ Blue Ribbon Panel have instituted “requirements that the attorneys who serve in their office work to improve the community,” including coaching Little League teams.  The report states:  For example, some U.S. Attorneys require prosecutors to participate in community outreach outside of work, such as coaching Little League teams, mentoring at risk youths or speaking at local elementary schools about preventing violence. To quote one former U.S. Attorney at the Blue Ribbon Panel, “I pulled people out and told them that we needed to be involved in our communities and that interacting with the community wasn’t just for social workers.”  Jones’ report hails that some U.S. Attorneys “have changed their attorney Performance Work Plans (which evaluate and set goals for prosecutors) to ask how many community meetings prosecutors have attended to speak about anti-violence initiatives or how many trips they have made to speak to underserved communities.”  The Brennan report hails a project led by U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida Wifredo Ferrer titled Violence Reduction Partnership, which required “prosecutors to conduct workshops in schools on preventing bullying and protecting against Internet predators.”  The report also pushed a strategy whereby prosecutors go outside the preview of the U.S. judicial system to monitor disputes within the framework of working locally within the community.  The report advocates a strategy that “often entails opening up a neighborhood prosecutor’s office in a storefront.”  “Prosecutors speak with neighborhood residents to better understand their concerns regarding crime. They use that information to choose which crimes to prosecute and which charges to bring. They also develop solutions to problems that do not involve prosecutions, such as mediating disputes and participating in school intervention programs.”  To push its agenda, the Brennan Center recommended that the Obama administration enact “Success Oriented Funding,” which “ties government funding as tightly as possible to clear priorities that drive toward the twin goals of reducing crime and reducing mass incarceration.” In other words, more funding would seemingly be granted to jurisdictions that enact shorter sentences for offenders.  Jones Has Deeper Ties to Soros Group  Besides his work heading Brennan’s panel on reforming the role of U.S. Attorneys, Jones is also a member of a group formed in 2015 by the Soros-funded Brennan Center calling itself Law Enforcement Leaders to Reduce Crime and Incarceration. The group says it aims to push “reforms to reduce incarceration and strengthen public safety.”  Jones participated in a Brennan conference titled, “Shifting law enforcement goals to reduce mass incarceration.”  On his 2017 Senatorial campaign website, Jones pushes a living wage plan for the state and country that, as Breitbart News reported last week, has a history of hurting small businesses, negatively impacting local economies and decreasing employment opportunities for low income workers. The brief economic policy listing on Jones’ campaign website calls for the enactment of a “living wage,” which would hike the minimum wage above the federal minimum.  The Brennan Center played a leading role in helping to craft living wage ordinances and ballot measures for numerous cities and states.  The living wage was originally a project of the controversial former group known as ACORN, or the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, which played a central role in enacting the scheme in several cities.

990,2534,10,24,2017,2017-10-24,Associated Press News,"McDiscount: $1 soda, 2 for $5 deals lure more to McDonald’s"," Cheap soda and burgers brought more people into McDonald’s.  The fast-food company said Tuesday that sales in the U.S. rose 4.1 percent at existing locations during the third quarter, thanks to $1 soft drinks, coupons on its app and a two-for-$5 promotion called McPick 2. And with more people coming in, McDonald’s said some also bought pricier burgers stuffed with crispy onions, kale or guacamole, which helped sales.  “We are serving more customers, more often,” said CEO Steve Easterbrook.  McDonald’s has been offering deals to fight off competition from other low-priced chains. It plans to offer more cheap eats next year, with items priced at $1, $2 and $3, the company said Tuesday.  Bill Fahy, an analyst at Moody’s, said the boost in sales is “a good indication that the company’s various initiatives are resonating well with consumers.”  Besides discounts, McDonald’s has also been tinkering with its menu as more people shun processed foods. It removed artificial preservatives from its nuggets and it plans to use fresh beef in Quarter Pounder burgers next year. And it has been modernizing its restaurants by adding mobile ordering and offering delivery through the UberEats app. About 5,000 of its nearly 14,000 U.S. locations will have delivery by the end of the year.  The company’s McCafe drinks “performed well,” said Chris Kempczinski, who oversees McDonald’s U.S. business, but he didn’t provide any numbers. The company rolled out espresso drinks, such as cappuccino and caramel macchiato, during the quarter and plans to remodel McCafes in its restaurants next year.  “McCafe can be a significant growth platform for us in the future,” Kempczinski said.  Worldwide, McDonald’s sales rose 6 percent at existing restaurants, the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said.  Overall, McDonald’s reported net income of $1.88 billion, or $2.32 per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30. That’s up from $1.28 billion, or $1.50 per share, in the same period a year ago. Adjusted earnings came to $1.76 per share, a penny above what analysts expected, according to Zacks Investment Research.  Revenue fell 10 percent to $5.75 billion, missing analyst expectations of $5.8 billion. The company said it brought in less revenue as it switched more stores from company-owned restaurants to ones owned by franchisees, especially in China and Hong Kong.  Shares of McDonald’s Corp rose 54 cents to close Tuesday at $163.88.  _____  Contact Joseph Pisani at http://twitter.com/josephpisani  _____  Elements of this story were generated by Automated Insights (http://automatedinsights.com/ap) using data from Zacks Investment Research.

1023,2585,10,25,2017,2017-10-25,The New York Times,Tax Cuts Are the Glue Holding a Fractured Republican Party Together,"On Wednesday, Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, acknowledged a long list of still-unresolved issues in the House’s draft bill, which is to be released Nov. 1. They included where to place the income limits for various tax brackets, whether to maintain or cut tax rates on top earners, and the fate of several critical components of the revamped corporate code.  Two issues in dispute flared up publicly: changes to retirement savings and to individuals’ ability to deduct their state and local taxes.  Mr. Brady seemed to defend a proposal to drastically lower the cap on tax-free retirement account contributions. He indicated that there were better ways to encourage the bulk of workers to save, even after Mr. Trump declared on Monday that “there will be NO change to your 401(k).”  “Right now, we are not a nation of savers,” Mr. Brady said at a breakfast convened by The Christian Science Monitor, adding: “We think in tax reform we can create incentives for Americans to save more and save sooner.”  Privately, though, a member of House leadership assured lobbyists on Wednesday that retirement account limits would not be touched in the draft bill.  House Republicans have been considering sharply reducing the amount that Americans are allowed to save, before taxes, in 401(k) retirement plans to $2,400 a year, from the current $18,000, or $24,000 for workers who are over 50. Lowering the cap would be unlikely to encourage more savings, research suggests, but it would amount to an accounting maneuver that would help Republicans make up some of the lost revenue from large cuts to business tax rates. Money in such retirement accounts is taxed when it is withdrawn. By taxing most deposits immediately, Republicans would push future tax revenue into the 10-year budget window they are now working in.",94.0,125.0

Embassy spokesperson David McGuire told the Associated Press that Martha O’Donovan was detained on Friday morning.  O’Donovan is now being represented by Obey Shava of Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights, who said authorities made the decision to arrest her because of “tweets emanating from her IT address [that were] insulting to the president.”  She had been living in Zimbabwe as part of her work for Magamba TV, which describes itself as the “leading producer of cutting-edge, political satire and comedy shows” aimed at a younger audience.  Magamba TV also confirmed her detention at a center in Harare, although she was yet to be charged formally.  Earlier today the police arrested @Martha_ODonovan for allegedly insulting the president on socia media. — Magamba Tv (@MagambaTV) November 3, 2017  According to Zimbabwean outlet Harare 24, authorities had obtained a warrant for a morning raid on O’Donovan’s property and seized all of her electronic devices.  The tweet in question reportedly “referred to a certain Goblin, whose wife and stepsons imported a Rolls Royce vehicle,” although it did not make a direct reference to Robert Mugabe, the nation’s nonagenarian dictator. It is not visible due to the privacy settings on her account.  O’Donovan’s arrest comes a month after Mugabe appointed a minister for cybersecurity tasked with policing crimes on social media, which government critics dubbed the “minister of Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp affairs.”  Last year, an anti-government pastor was also arrested after circulating videos highlighting the country’s worsening economic problems, which included people waiting in long lines for basic products such as food and fuel, while the group Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights claims it has represented nearly 200 people charged with criticizing the government.  The move was also an attempt to crack down on growing anti-government dissidence across Zimbabwe, especially with the rise of protest movements primarily organized via social media.  It also coincides with the country’s 2018 elections, with 93-year-old Mugabe still intending to run for another five-year term as leader of the left-wing nationalist Zimbabwe African National Union, meaning he would be 99 by the time he left office.  Mugabe, who has ruled Zimbabwe by decree since becoming president in 1980 following independence from Britain, last won re-election in 2013, in a vote widely condemned as fraudulent by members of the international community.

(AP Photo/Matt Dunham, Pool)  LONDON (AP) — British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has fueled speculation that he hopes to eventually succeed Prime Minister Theresa May by spelling out his Brexit goals days before her major policy speech on the topic.  Johnson, a former journalist, wrote a 4,000-word article in the Saturday edition of The Daily Telegraph newspaper to explain how Brexit can bring a “glorious” future to Britain and help it become “the greatest country on Earth.” He says Britain shouldn’t seek to stay in the European Union’s single market or the customs union, and should seize the opportunity to make its own way.  The timing of his Brexit broadside is important because May is scheduled to detail her own Brexit views at a much-touted speech in Italy on Sept. 22.  Johnson making his own views known first may be seen by many as a challenge to her authority, which has been weakened by a poor result in the June 8 election that cost her Conservative Party its majority in Parliament.  Johnson sought to quiet speculation later Saturday by tweeting: “All behind Theresa for a glorious Brexit.”  Johnson was an avid campaigner to have Britain leave the EU in the 2016 Brexit referendum.  He used the newspaper article to again raise the widely discredited idea that leaving the EU could allow Britain to add 350 million pounds ($475 million) a week to the National Health Service and argued that lifting regulations and reforming tax rules would allow Britain to prosper.  May has been able to hold onto her job despite her poor electoral performance, but has been facing increasing pressure as Brexit negotiations with the EU have stalled over the question of how much Britain must pay to leave the 28-nation bloc.  Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, whose opposition party fared well in the general election, said through a spokesman that Johnson’s Brexit views exposed the deep rifts within May’s Conservative government.  “Boris Johnson has laid bare the conflicts at the heart of Theresa May’s government over Brexit and cut the ground from beneath the prime minister’s authority,” Corbyn’s spokesman said. “In the process he has exposed the Tories’ real Brexit agenda — a race-to-the-bottom in regulation and corporate tax cuts to benefit the wealthy few at the expense of the rights of the rest of us.”",4.0,6.0
1383,2992,11,4,2017,2017-11-04,Breitbart,Steve Bannon: Central Issue of 2016 Election Was ‘Sovereignty of Our Country’," Former White House chief strategist and Breitbart News executive chairman Stephen K. Bannon declared to a passionate room full of immigration activists on Saturday that the sovereignty of the United States has been the central issue of the 2016 presidential election, of fights on Capitol Hill, and within the Republican Party.  Bannon took the crowd gathered for the Remembrance Project event back through several points of the 2016 election, such as then-candidate Donald Trump’s trip to Mexico to meet with the Mexican President about immigration, and the subsequent visit to Phoenix, Arizona, meeting with Angel moms and holding a rally.  Bannon said people remember that the biggest fight in the Republican Party and on Capitol Hill hasn’t been taxes, Obamacare, or Afghanistan, “It’s been the central issue of the sovereignty of our country.”  “It was the stories and putting the faces to these stories to the American people that was the key that picked the lock for President Trump’s victory,” said Bannon.  He went on to list the names of about a dozen Americans, many merely in their teens, who have been the victims of violent crime by illegal aliens in the United States. At Bannon’s request, the crowd then applauded and rose to their feet to honor these fallen Americans.  He asked the crowd why illegal aliens are called “DREAMers” rather than these Americans who won’t get to live out their dreams.  “This is not some random law of the universe,” said Bannon. He called out the “economic, the political, and the media elites,” for allowing this to happen, for wanting it to happen, calling their actions “an act of commission.” He called out the corporations that want cheap labor and the progressives who want “cheap votes.”  Bannon called out the suppression of information on illegal immigration and the stories of those killed by illegal aliens. “Why was this suppressed?” He called out 60 Minutes, NBC, and CNN for going around the world to show everything wrong with America but ignoring those victimized by illegal immigration. He pinpointed the issue of whom the victims are: “Hispanic and black and Asian and white working class men and women, the backbone of this country.”  He spoke of the contempt of elites for those in the room, crediting the efforts of those at the event, a “handful of journalists,” and Donald J. Trump for shining a light on the issue of illegal immigration.  Bannon went on to emphasize that for the political elites, “The only business they’re in is the business of getting re-elected.” He spoke also of Trump’s 10-point plan on immigration.  He pointed to the ouster of Eric Cantor, a member of the Republican leadership, by someone with far less money who talked about the problem of illegal immigration. He then turned to talk of the Virginia governor’s race being held in just a few days and the 2018 elections. Bannon stressed the importance of Virginia Republican gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie talking about issues like illegal immigration if he wants to get Trump voters to turn out to help him win the election.  Bannon told the crowd that the elites hold them in contempt and are willing to hide information for their own money and power.  He called out House Speaker Paul Ryan and warned of the trouble to come in those 2018 elections if Ryan tries to slip amnesty through.  “It’s obvious to everybody that we’re going to have to take over the Republican Party,” said Bannon. They can “go the easy way or the hard way, but they’re goin’.”  He spoke of the mountains of money the Republican establishment uses to try to win elections, like in Alabama, where Judge Roy Moore beat the establishment candidate. Bannon pointed out that now “the more money they spend the fewer votes they get.” He added, “We’ve turned their greatest asset, their money, into their greatest liability.” He said that candidates are no longer seeking Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s endorsement but are now “running from it.”  Bannon said that Trump is on track to be one of the greatest presidents, like Reagan, Lincoln, or Jackson, but he has to “just stick to the plan.”  He told the crowd that the fight in 2018 is going to be so “nasty,” but he’s glad to be on their side. He told them that they represent the 12-13 generations of working class, middle-class people. Referencing Trump’s 2016 election wins in Wisconsin, North Carolina, and Missouri, Bannon told the crowd that the Majority Leader owes his position to them.  Bannon closed with a warning, saying, “you’ve got tough days ahead of you” but with encouragement to “hang in there and fight.”  Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana",6.0,3.0
1308,2907,11,2,2017,2017-11-02,Vox,Why this “die-hard Republican” voter is open to Medicare-for-all,"This is the web version of VoxCare, a daily newsletter from Vox on the latest twists and turns in America’s health care debate. Like what you’re reading? Sign up to get VoxCare in your inbox here.  This week, I listened to what 16 Trump voters thought about a single-payer, Medicare-for-all health care program.  Most of these folks don't trust the government to run a health care system and don't believe philosophically it should. They are worried about their taxes going up. They are worried about losing the health insurance they've got now and they like.  But there was one surprise in these groups, which took place near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and were run by opinion researcher Michael Perry. Her name was Kate.  Kate, who said she works in sales, didn't like her current insurance. She gave it a 3 out of 10; she said her deductibles had ""skyrocketed.  ""I have had to struggle to pay for my insurance,"" she said.  The most revealing moment came when Mike asked everybody if they thought health care was a right. A few said yes. A few said no. Kate was last.  This is what she said:  I’m conflicted. I’m truly conflicted. You say the government shouldn’t be in medical care, but it is — Medicare, Social Security. You’re talking about the lower to middle class. You are stuck in the middle, paying taxes they don’t reap benefits from. I don’t want to say it’s not fair. But I don’t see any way out of that, unless you go to a single-payer system. I am truly a die-hard Republican. But over the last few years, I wonder about a single-payer system, something like the Canadian system. I want people who don’t have health care to have health care.  Toward the end of the meeting, Mike came to Kate again. She elaborated a little bit on where she was coming from.  There's inability to move forward with anything, and in health care we’re talking about human beings’ lives here. It’s like food. Everybody should have food, and I really think people should not have to worry about going to the doctor. That should be one thing taken away from their daily worries. Maybe the government could find something.  But she shared some of the same concerns as her peers, particularly about the government's ability to run a health care program well.  I think it should be debated because I think it could have a place. But I really worry about the bureaucrats getting their hands on it. They like paper and they like to generate more of it.  I should emphasize again: Kate was the exception. The other Trump voters we spoke with believed, as a matter of principle, that the government is not responsible for everybody's health care. Or they simply didn't trust the government to run a program effectively. They had heard horror stories about other countries' health care systems, long waiting lists and the like.  This also wasn't quantitative research. We talked to 16 people — enough to get some impressions, hardly a rigorous national survey.  But Kate was a useful reminder that even an issue this divisive and ostensibly partisan doesn't break down strictly on party lines. We know from the Kaiser Family Foundation that about one-quarter of Republicans say they would favor a single-payer system. There are other Kates.  Her frustrations with the status quo and this conflict between her ideological beliefs and what she actually thinks might help to alleviate those frustrations, and could tell us something about where the health care debate is heading.  vox-mark VoxCare Vox's email explaining the biggest news in health care, edited by Sarah Kliff Subscribe By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy.

711,2124,10,17,2017,2017-10-17,Vox,He left the NFL and is becoming a cop — but says the NFL protests over police brutality have a point,"Cameron Gordon has seen both sides of the NFL protests. In 2015, he won the Super Bowl with the New England Patriots, and retired a couple of seasons later. Now, in 2017, he expects to graduate from the 133rd Recruit Class of the Michigan State Police by the end of November.  So his take on the national anthem protests is particularly illuminating: “I like the discussion that it’s caused,” he told Politico.  Gordon’s take on the protests, in which NFL players typically kneel or lock arms instead of standing for the national anthem before games to protest racial inequality and police brutality, is nuanced:  What they’re saying is, “We don’t feel a part of America and we’re submitting to the flag.” Which is saying: “I want to have those equal rights, I want to feel as though I’m being treated equally when I’m pulled over in a stop or when I’m in need of help.” I don’t want to feel as if I’m a criminal in every instance I run into law enforcement. … All law enforcement is not perfect. There’s bad apples. Just like athletes. I know how athletes are. All athletes aren’t perfect. … When the whole domestic violence thing was coming out, I was getting looked at as a person who was, you know, hitting women or something. And I was like, “No, that’s not the case. Everyone’s not like that.” Just like the blemishes that police officers are getting right now.  Ultimately, though, Gordon concluded that if he were still in the NFL, “There’s probably a good chance that I would take a knee. Yeah. And me being in law enforcement now, that’s why I’m torn, because I know why. I feel like I know why, and that’s because people want to be treated fairly. Like ‘Hey, can I be a part of something that I don’t feel like I’m a part of?’ and that’s … basic constitutional rights.”  Gordon’s point, in short, is that the protests do have a legitimate grievance — and he can understand that even as a soon-to-be-cop whose brother is also a police officer in Detroit.  President Donald Trump, however, has characterized the protests as an affront to the flag, military, and country. As Trump said — to wild applause — at a rally, “Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field’?” Trump later said his criticisms of the protests have nothing to do with race, but are instead about “respect for our country and respect for our flag.” He has particularly focused on how taking a knee is, in his view, disrespectful to military veterans.  Gordon disagreed: “There’s no reason why veterans should get mad at them taking a knee. I feel personally there’s no reason because veterans go across overseas to fight for our rights. That’s no different than what they’re trying to do in a peaceful way, and they have the right to do so. Taking a knee, it’s a silent protest. They’re not burning anything up. They’re not tearing anything up. It’s a way to start a conversation, and it’s different than what you typically see on television.”  This lines up more with what the actual protesters have said. Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who started the demonstrations last year, reportedly worked with Nate Boyer, a former NFL player who was previously a US Army Green Beret, to avoid offending military veterans. And Kaepernick was clear that his goal was to protest police brutality and racial inequality, not the country or military as a whole.  “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,” Kaepernick said during his original protests. “To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.”  For more on the NFL protests, read Vox’s explainer.

1419,3039,11,4,2017,2017-11-04,Associated Press News,"Sprint, T-Mobile end merger talks"," Wireless carriers Sprint and T-Mobile called off a potential merger, saying the companies couldn’t come to an agreement that would benefit customers and shareholders.  The two companies have been dancing around a possible merger for years, and were again in the news in recent weeks with talks of the two companies coming together after all. But in a joint statement Saturday, Sprint and T-Mobile said they are calling off merger negotiations for the foreseeable future.  “The prospect of combining with Sprint has been compelling for a variety of reasons, including the potential to create significant benefits for consumers and value for shareholders. However, we have been clear all along that a deal with anyone will have to result in superior long-term value for T-Mobile’s shareholders compared to our outstanding stand-alone performance and track record,” said John Legere, president and CEO of T-Mobile US, in a prepared statement.  T-Mobile and Sprint are the U.S.′ third- and fourth-largest wireless carriers, respectively, but they are significantly smaller than AT&T and Verizon, who effectively have a duopoly over U.S. wireless service. The two companies have said they hoped to find a way of merging to make the wireless market more competitive.  Sprint and its owner, the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, have long been looking for a deal as the company has struggled to compete on its own. But Washington regulators have frowned on a possible merger. D.C. spiked AT&T’s offer to buy T-Mobile in 2011 and signaled in 2014 they would have been against Sprint doing the same thing. But with the new Trump administration, it was thought regulators might be more relaxed about a merger.  Sprint has a lot of debt and has posted a string of annual losses. The company has cut costs and made itself more attractive to customers, BTIG Research analyst Walter Piecyk says, but it hasn’t invested enough in its network and doesn’t have enough airwave rights for quality service in rural areas.  T-Mobile, meanwhile, has been on a yearslong streak adding customers. After the government nixed AT&T’s attempt to buy it in 2011, T-Mobile led the way in many consumer-friendly changes, such as ditching two-year contracts and bringing back unlimited data plans. Consumers are paying less for cellphone service, thanks to T-Mobile’s influence on the industry and the resultant price wars.  “T-Mobile does not need a merger with Sprint to succeed, but Sprint might need one to survive,” Piecyk wrote in an October research note.",18.0,17.0
1267,2866,11,1,2017,2017-11-01,Breitbart,Day Seven: John McCain Continues to Dodge Questions on Role in Trump Hoax Dossier,"(New York) Sen. John McCain has still not responded to questions raised in light of the disclosure last Tuesday that the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) helped fund research utilized in the infamous, largely discredited 35-page dossier on President Donald Trump.  In December, it was McCain who notoriously passed the controversial dossier produced by the Washington firm Fusion GPS to then FBI Director James Comey, whose agency reportedly utilized the dossier as a partial basis for its probe into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.  McCain’s office did not respond to repeated Breitbart News phone and email requests over the course of last week and this week seeking comment on whether the Arizona senator was aware that the material he passed to the FBI was paid for by the DNC and Clinton’s campaign.  McCain’s office also did not respond to requests for information on how he first obtained the dossier, which is filled with discredited charges.  A spokesperson for McCain confirmed by telephone that the Breitbart News requests were received.  The Washington Post last Tuesday reported that in April 2016, attorney Marc E. Elias and his law firm, Perkins Coie, retained Fusion GPS to conduct the questionable research on behalf of both the Clinton campaign and the DNC. Through Perkins Coie, Clinton’s campaign and the DNC continued to fund Fusion GPS until October 2016, days before Election Day, the Post reported.  Fusion GPS went on to hire former intelligence agent Christopher Steele to do the purported research. Steele later conceded in court documents that part of his work still needed to be verified.  Last week, the Washington Free Beacon confirmed it originally retained Fusion GPS to conduct opposition research on numerous GOP candidates, including Trump. Free Beacon Chairman Michael Goldfarb served as deputy communications director on McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign.  The Free Beacon denied any involvement with the dossier or Steele. “During the 2016 election cycle we retained Fusion GPS to provide research on multiple candidates in the Republican presidential primary, just as we retained other firms to assist in our research into Hillary Clinton,” wrote Goldfarb in a joint statement with the site’s editor-in-chief, Matthew Continetti.  They continued: “The Free Beacon had no knowledge of or connection to the Steele dossier, did not pay for the dossier, and never had contact with, knowledge of, or provided payment for any work performed by Christopher Steele.”  On January 10, CNN was first to report, based on leaked information, that the contents of the dossier were presented during classified briefings one week earlier to then-President Obama and President-elect Trump.  Just after CNN’s January 10 report on the classified briefings about the dossier, BuzzFeed published the dossier’s full unverified contents.  Earlier this month, McCain denied providing the dossier to BuzzFeed and said that he only gave the material to the FBI. “I gave it to no one except for the director of the FBI. I don’t know why you’re digging this up now,” McCain told the Daily Caller during what the news website described as a testy exchange.  It is not immediately clear how McCain obtained the dossier in the first place.  A January 11 statement from McCain attempted to explain why he provided the documents to the FBI but did not mention how he came to possess the dossier or whether he knew who funded it.  “Upon examination of the contents, and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy, I delivered the information to the director of the FBI,” McCain said at the time. “That has been the extent of my contact with the FBI or any other government agency regarding this issue.”  Sir Andrew Wood, a former British ambassador to Moscow, said McCain first consulted him about the claims inside the dossier at a security conference in Canada shortly after last November’s presidential election. Wood stated that McCain had obtained the documents from the senator’s own sources. “I told him I was aware of what was in the report but I had not read it myself, that it might be true, it might be untrue. I had no means of judging really,” Wood further told BBC Radio 4 in January.  In March, Vanity Fair raised questions about the alleged involvement of David J. Kramer, a former State Department official, in helping to obtain the dossier directly from Steele. The issue was also raised in a lawsuit filed against Steele by one of the individuals named in the dossier.  Meanwhile, CNN reported that in private interviews with Congressional investigators prior to the Post’s report revealing Perkins Coie’s reported payment to Fusion GPS, former Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and former DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz both denied that they were aware of any arrangement to fund Fusion GPS’s opposition research. CNN reported that Elias was seated next to Podesta during the private interview.  That report prompted former CIA Director Leon Panetta to advocate for a Senate Intelligence Committee investigation of both the Clinton campaign and the DNC regarding whether they had any knowledge of the payment to Fusion GPS to produce the dossier.  “Well, it certainly makes the situation very awkward,” Panetta said of Elias’s alleged involvement. “If you’re testifying and saying you have no knowledge, and the attorney sitting next to you is one of those that knew what was involved here, I think it does raise an issue that the committee is going to have to look at and determine just exactly who knew what.”  The dossier contains wild and unproven claims that the Russians had information regarding Trump and sordid sexual acts, including the widely mocked claim that Trump hired prostitutes and had them urinate on a hotel room bed. It also claimed there was an exchange of information between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government.  Those allegations remain unsubstantiated following numerous public hearings. Indeed, former CIA Director John Brennan made clear in testimony last May that after viewing all of the evidence that was available to him on the Russia probe he was not aware of any collusion between Russia and members of Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.  Dossier was reportedly basis for Obama administration moves  According to the BBC, the dossier served as a “roadmap” for the FBI’s investigation into claims of coordination between Moscow and members of Trump’s presidential campaign during the Obama administration.  In April, CNN reported that the dossier served as part of the FBI’s justification for seeking the FISA court’s reported approval to clandestinely monitor the communications of Carter Page, the American oil industry investor who was tangentially and briefly associated with Trump’s presidential campaign.  Senior Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have reportedly requested that the FBI and Department of Justice turn over applications for any warrants to monitor the communications of U.S. citizens associated with the investigation into alleged Russia interference in the 2016 presidential election.  In testimony last month, Comey repeatedly refused to answer questions about his agency’s ties to the dossier.  In testimony last month to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Comey admitted he pushed back against a request from President Donald Trump to possibly investigate the origins of “salacious material” that the agency possessed in the course of its investigation into alleged Russian interference.  Dossier discredited  Major questions have been raised as to the veracity of the dossier, large sections of which have been discredited.  Citing a “Kremlin insider,” the dossier, which misspelled the name of a Russian diplomat, claimed that Trump lawyer Michael Cohen held “secret meetings” with Kremlin officials in Prague in August 2016.  That charge unraveled after Cohen revealed he had never traveled to Prague, calling the story “totally fake, totally inaccurate.” The Atlantic confirmed Cohen’s whereabouts in New York and California during the period the dossier claimed that Cohen was in Prague. Cohen reportedly produced his passport showing he had not traveled to Prague.  During testimony in May, the FBI’s Comey confirmed that the basis for the intelligence community’s assessment that Russia allegedly wanted Trump in office was not because the billionaire was, as Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) claimed during a hearing, “ensnared in” Russia’s “web of patronage” – just as the dossier alleged. Instead, the FBI chief provided two primary reasons for Russia’s alleged favoring of Trump over Clinton during the 2016 presidential race.  One reason, according to Comey, was that Putin “hated” Clinton and would have favored any Republican opponent. The second reason, Comey explained, was that Putin made an assessment that it would be easier to make a deal with a businessman than someone from the political class.  Comey’s statements are a far cry from the conspiracies fueled by the dossier alleging Putin held blackmail information over the billionaire.  Citing current and former government officials, the New Yorker reported the dossier prompted skepticism among intelligence community members, with the publication quoting one member saying it was a “nutty” piece of evidence to submit to a U.S. president.  Steele’s work has been questioned by former acting CIA Director Michael Morell, who currently works at the Hillary Clinton-tied Beacon Global Strategies LLC.  NBC News reported on Morell’s questions about Steele’s credibility:  Morell, who was in line to become CIA director if Clinton won, said he had seen no evidence that Trump associates cooperated with Russians. He also raised questions about the dossier written by a former British intelligence officer, which alleged a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia. … Morell pointed out that former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said on Meet the Press on March 5 that he had seen no evidence of a conspiracy when he left office January 20. “That’s a pretty strong statement by General Clapper,” Morell said.  Regarding Steele’s dossier, Morell stated, “Unless you know the sources, and unless you know how a particular source acquired a particular piece of information, you can’t judge the information — you just can’t.”  Morell charged the dossier “doesn’t take you anywhere, I don’t think.”  “I had two questions when I first read it. One was, How did Chris talk to these sources? I have subsequently learned that he used intermediaries.”  Morell continued:  And then I asked myself, why did these guys provide this information, what was their motivation? And I subsequently learned that he paid them. That the intermediaries paid the sources and the intermediaries got the money from Chris. And that kind of worries me a little bit because if you’re paying somebody, particularly former FSB [Russian intelligence] officers, they are going to tell you truth and innuendo and rumor, and they’re going to call you up and say, “Hey, let’s have another meeting, I have more information for you,” because they want to get paid some more. I think you’ve got to take all that into consideration when you consider the dossier.  Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

248,1542,10,3,2017,2017-10-03,Vox,The Senate is voting on a 20-week abortion ban. Opponents say it's “basically relying on junk science.”,"On Monday, the Senate will hold a procedural vote on a bill that would make abortion after 20 weeks illegal in every state in the country. Called the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, it’s based on the idea that a fetus at 20 weeks’ gestation can feel pain.  “The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act will protect the voiceless, the vulnerable, and the marginalized,"" said Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), the House majority leader, in a statement in September (the House passed the bill in early October). ""It will protect those children who science has proven can feel pain.” While the bill is unlikely to pass the Senate because of the 60 votes required, President Donald Trump has promised to sign the it if it passes; during the campaign, he said such a bill “would end painful late-term abortions nationwide.”  In fact, the best available science shows that fetuses probably cannot feel pain until well after 20 weeks. Advocates of abortion rights say 20-week bans at the state level have harmed women, forcing them to travel to another state, often at great expense, to get the care they seek. And opponents of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act fear that, even if it never passes, it will ultimately spread dangerous misinformation.  The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act is not based on accepted science  The bill, sponsored by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), would ban abortions after 20 weeks nationwide, except in cases of rape, incest, or a threat to the life of the mother. A doctor who performed an abortion after 20 weeks, except in those cases, could face up to five years in prison. Women seeking abortions would not be penalized under the bill.  The text of the bill includes a section on the science of fetal pain, which states that “there is substantial medical evidence that an unborn child is capable of experiencing pain at least by 20 weeks after fertilization, if not earlier.”  However, the general scientific consensus is that no such evidence exists. “There’s actually conclusive evidence that shows that the neurologic structures in a fetus aren’t completely laid down and working yet until much further along in pregnancy, we think even the third trimester,” said Jennifer Conti, a clinical assistant professor and OB-GYN at Stanford University and a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health. Twenty weeks, she said, “is just an arbitrary limit set in place by politicians that has no medical or scientific backing.”  The most comprehensive look at fetal pain to date was a literature review published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2005. According to the review, the structures needed for fetuses to feel pain begin to develop between 23 and 30 weeks’ gestation, and studies of premature babies suggest they can’t feel pain until 29 or 30 weeks. While this review is now 12 years old, it still holds true — “no research since its publication has contradicted its findings,” wrote Mark S. DeFrancesco on behalf of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in 2015.  The bill makes a number of claims that contradict scientific consensus. For instance, the bill states that “after 20 weeks, the unborn child reacts to stimuli that would be recognized as painful if applied to an adult human, for example, by recoiling.” However, according to the group Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health (ANSIRH) at the University of California, San Francisco, “limb withdrawal occurs even in full-term babies in response to non-painful tactile sensations, including light touch. Thus the appearance of limb withdrawal on ultrasound represents a reflex rather than a response to pain.”  The bill, said Amy Friedrich-Karnik, senior federal policy adviser at the Center for Reproductive Rights, is “basically relying on junk science.”  This bill isn’t new — and we’ve already seen some of its effects  The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act previously passed the House in 2015, as Jessie Hellmann notes at the Hill, but failed in the Senate. Similar bans have also passed in more than a dozen states.  People seek abortions after 20 weeks for a variety of reasons. One patient who came to Conti seeking an abortion said that a clinic the previous week had told her she was 12 weeks pregnant. But the clinic turned out to be a crisis pregnancy center that had given her incorrect information — she was actually 21 weeks along. “Essentially her care was sabotaged,” Conti said — and under a 20-week ban, she would have been unable to get an abortion.  Patients can also be pushed to get abortions later in pregnancy by financial or logistical problems, like difficulty getting to a clinic or getting together the money for the procedure. In states with 20-week bans already in place, patients who need later abortions typically have to travel to another state, said Friedrich-Karnik. That can cause enormous financial strain, she said. But “to imagine a ban like this nationwide and to think that no one could even have the opportunity to go to another state to get the care is frightening.”  The bill passed the House by a vote of 237-189. It probably will not pass the Senate, Hellmann writes, where it would need a 60-vote majority. Republicans may be using Monday’s vote as a way to put pressure on Democratic senators in red states, like Claire McCaskill (D-MO) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), Hellmann noted in January. Both voted against the 20-week ban in 2015, and anti-abortion activists hope a vote against the bill this year will make the senators vulnerable in November’s elections.  Even if it never becomes federal law, Conti said, the bill can still cause harm. “By even putting this issue on a national platform,” she said, “you’re misleading the American people.”  “You’re really providing false and dangerous information that is affecting millions of women,” she added.",1.0,2.0

Chief Executive Officer Masayoshi Son, left, speaks during a SoftBank World presentation at a hotel in Tokyo. Japanese internet and solar company SoftBank Group Corp. is raising its stake in Sprint Corp. after merger talks with T-Mobile collapsed, signaling its commitment to a turnaround at the U.S. wireless carrier. SoftBank reported Monday, Nov. 6, 2017, that July-September net profit tumbled to 113 billion yen ($991 million) from 528 billion yen a year ago. (AP Photo/Shizuo Kambayashi, File)  TOKYO (AP) — Japanese internet and solar company SoftBank Group Corp. is raising its stake in Sprint Corp. after merger talks with T-Mobile collapsed, signaling its commitment to a turnaround at the U.S. wireless carrier.  Tokyo-based SoftBank reported Monday that July-September net profit tumbled to 113 billion yen ($991 million) from 528 billion yen a year ago.  Quarterly sales rose nearly 4 percent to 2.23 trillion yen ($19.5 billion) on improved results at Sprint, as well as revenue from Arm, a British chips company SoftBank acquired last year.  Helping bring profit lower was the absence of last year’s foreign-exchange gains, as well as derivative losses that came from its sale of part of its stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.  T-Mobile and Sprint are the third- and fourth-largest wireless carriers, respectively, in the U.S., but they are significantly smaller than AT&T and Verizon, which effectively have a duopoly over the U.S. wireless service.  Wireless carriers Sprint and T-Mobile called off a potential merger Saturday, saying the companies couldn’t come to an agreement that would benefit customers and shareholders.  The two companies have been dancing around a possible merger for years, and were again in the news in recent weeks with talks of them coming together after all. But in a joint statement Saturday, Sprint and T-Mobile said the negotiations were off for the foreseeable future.  Sprint has debt and has been losing money, but its results had been improving gradually, partly because of additional investments from SoftBank, which also sells the Pepper humanoid.  But both analysts and SoftBank had said they believed Sprint needs a deal, rather than trying to compete on its own.  But Washington regulators have frowned on a possible merger. D.C. spiked AT&T’s offer to buy T-Mobile in 2011, and signaled in 2014 they would have been against Sprint doing the same thing. But with the new Trump administration, it was thought regulators might be more relaxed about a merger.  SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son told reporters that the talks fell apart because T-Mobile did not want to be equal partners in management. But he insisted Sprint will prove a gold mine because of the move to IoT, where SoftBank’s investment in Arm will pay off, especially in the U.S.  “We are entering an era where billions of new connected devices and sensors will come online throughout the United States,” he said. “Sprint is a critical part of our plan to ensure that we can deliver our vision to American consumers and we are very confident in its future.”  Son said he felt “absolutely great” after the merger talks ended because worries over indecisiveness were gone.  “It was an important decision,” he said. “But the day will come when having Sprint will pay off.”  Although Arm’s sales grew from the previous year, its losses grew as well because of costs for hiring engineers.  Son, credited as a visionary and seen in the company of high-profile people like Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates and President Donald Trump, has been aggressive in investing in artificial intelligence, the internet of things and renewable energy.  Son has set up a $100 billion SoftBank Vision Fund specially for the technology sector with money from Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and other investors.  SoftBank’s Japanese mobile business continued to do well in the last quarter, increasing smartphone subscribers, according to the company. SoftBank was the first carrier in Japan to offer Apple’s iPhone.  It also owns the SoftBank Hawks baseball club, which recently won the Japan Series, this nation’s equivalent of the World Series.  ___  Yuri Kageyama can be reached at twitter.com/yurikageyama  Her work can be found at https://www.apnews.com/search/yuri%20kageyama",16.0,15.0
1170,2751,10,29,2017,2017-10-29,Fox News,Deaths of US soldiers in Niger restart debate about military involvement post-Vietnam,"The United States found itself involved in a lengthy, divisive, military conflict overseas.  A surfeit of controversial incidents besieged the U.S. military and confounded official Washington as to what to do. Leaders at the National Security Council argued that local fighters were improving their military skills. As a result, the U.S. could cede more power to them.  In other words, the war needed to be “de-Americanized.” Instead, the Defense secretary chose another term: “Vietnamization.”  The above scenario obviously isn’t about the four U.S. soldiers killed earlier this month in Niger. It isn’t about President Trump’s decision in August to maintain the U.S. mission in Afghanistan and bolster troop levels there.  But what the U.S. is doing in Niger and Chad and Mali and Afghanistan and Iraq and Libya and Djibouti and Turkey and Yemen and Jordan and Uganda and Cameroon and South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic and Somalia and Kosovo and Cuba and parts of Syria …certainly echoes Defense Secretary Melvin Laird telling President Richard Nixon the U.S. should “Vietnamize” the battle in southeast Asia.  That would denote a shift. Laird asserted that “Vietnamization” properly characterized U.S. involvement going forward. After all, the U.S. didn’t want an open-ended commitment in Vietnam. Many in Washington wanted to get out as soon as possible.  Things certainly didn’t work out that way. The U.S. found itself paralyzed in Vietnam for years. As a result, “Vietnam Syndrome” set in among the public and the nation’s political leaders. Americans were reluctant to engage overseas.  In a speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars, President Ronald Reagan said that the U.S. lived with Vietnam Syndrome for “too long.” As a result, Reagan said Americans “were told that peace would come if we would simply stop interfering and go home.” Reagan declared “we dishonor the memory of the 50,000 young Americans who died in that cause when we give way to feelings of guilt as if we were doing something shameful.”  Reagan told the VFW that was the “lesson for all of us on Vietnam. If we are forced to fight, we must have the means and the determination to prevail or we will not have what it takes to secure the peace.”  Two months ago, Trump made the case to “Afghanize” the fight. The president said Afghan troops would bear “the heaviest burden” in this struggle. He also spoke of the thousands of U.S. troops who “fought and died in Afghanistan.” Trump suggested the U.S. needs to remain engaged in Afghanistan “to secure the cause for which they gave their lives.”  Vietnam was a seminal period in the American experience. It’s natural to draw parallels between Vietnam and other lengthy military engagements. The U.S. has now been in Afghanistan since shortly after 9/11.  How long should the U.S. stay? Ironically, military analysts now believe Vietnam isn’t the model to which people should look when discussing Afghanistan. They note how long the U.S. has remained on the Korean Peninsula.  This is ironic. Consider the fact that the 60-plus year U.S. presence there hasn’t inhibited the possibility of the U.S. facing off with Pyongyang in a nuclear war. Those chances are now as high as ever.  In June, the president submitted to Congress a report detailing all of the places the U.S. is involved militarily (most are listed above), information about deployments and justifications for the operations. Most of these missives from the administration to Congress contain a crucial phrase.  The letter states the information the president is sending to Capitol Hill is “consistent with the War Powers Resolution, as part of my efforts to keep Congress informed about deployments of the U.S. Armed Forces equipped for combat.”  Note it states “consistent with” the resolution. The letter doesn’t state “in compliance with.” No administration of either party has truly acknowledged the resolution since its adoption in 1974.  Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution grants Congress the power to declare war. Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution names the president commander in chief. Congress created the resolution as an additional check on the president to curb his war-making authority. This effort backfired as Congress inadvertently ceded more latitude to the president.  So short of declaring war somewhere, presidents simply slip Congress a note at regular intervals as to what the U.S. is doing where. Constitutional? Unclear. “Adhering” to the War Powers Resolution? Not really. “Consistent with” the resolution? You bet.  This brings us to Niger.  Think the U.S. is at “war” in Niger? Then why are there four dead Americans there and what were they doing there?  Trump’s June letter spells it all out. The president told lawmakers that “United States military personnel in the Lake Chad Basin continue to provide a wide variety of support to African partners conducting counterterrorism operations in the region. In Niger, there are about 645 U.S. military personnel deployed to support these missions.  In Cameroon, roughly 300 U.S. military personnel are also deployed, the bulk of whom are supporting United States airborne intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations in the region. These forces are equipped with weapons for the purpose of providing their own force protection and security, and they will remain in Cameroon, with the consent of the government of Cameroon, until their support is no longer needed.”  Time to “Vietnamize” the effort?  “The operation has caused us to begin to re-examine force protection in Niger,” said Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee. “We have to re-evaluate what we’re doing there.”  Few Americans even knew the U.S. was involved in Niger. Sen. Rand Paul, Kentucky, trolled fellow GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham on Twitter after the South Carolina senator told NBC he wasn’t fully aware of U.S. military operations there.  “You know you are in too many wars in too many places when even warmonger Lindsay Graham can’t keep track anymore,” Paul tweeted.  This is why Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., has long argued that the 2001 and 2002 authorizations Congress approved for wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are calcified. He’s pushed for a retrenched Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) for years now.  “We were in Niger to deal with an ISIS threat,” Kaine said. “It’s time for Congress to finally revisit the authorization which is badly out of date and have a debate on full view of the American public about all the different countries where we are in engaged in military action right now.”  Lawmakers of both parties have flirted with such a proposal for several years. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., convenes a hearing Monday about a potential new AUMF with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis.  “It is perhaps more important than ever that we have a sober national conversation about Congress’s Constitutional role in authorizing the use of military force,” Corker said.  Congress felt it was in the dark a few weeks ago about what went down in Niger and demanded more information from the Pentagon. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., threatened to subpoena military officials after they were less than forthcoming about Niger.  That prompted Mattis to pay McCain a courtesy call at his office. When asked in the hall if he hustled to Capitol Hill because of McCain’s subpoena warning, Mattis stopped in his tracks in a corridor of the Russell Senate Office Building.  “Are you kidding me?” replied an incredulous Mattis.  The Defense secretary than ventured over to talk with Graham. After that conclave, Graham offered perhaps the most sober assessment yet about U.S. involvement overseas and perhaps why Congress is mulling a new AUMF.  “This war is getting hot in places where it’s been cool,” he said about the broader war on terrorism.  “The war is beginning to morph,” Graham also said, noting that there would be more -- “not less” --operations like the one in Niger.  So the U.S. finds itself in Niger and Mali and Cameroon and Chad and the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo and a host of other places few Americans have ever heard of -- to say nothing about Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.  The perfect solution would be the “Vietnamization” of these conflicts as suggested so long ago by Defense Secretary Melvin Laird. But with the U.S. now committed all over the globe, it’s pretty clear the opposite happened. These battles are now “Americanized.”",4.0,8.0
940,2442,10,23,2017,2017-10-23,Breitbart,"Bannon Speech Surprises, Delights Typically Moderate California Republican Party","Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon’s address at the California Republican Party convention on Friday in Anaheim was remarkable — not just for its content, but for the reaction it elicited from the audience.  “Steve Bannon’s speech was the one that really fired up this convention,” said State Senator Joel Anderson (R-Alpine). “It’s easy as a California Republican to lose heart when you consider the kind of policy-making coming out of Sacramento. Bannon was able to remind people that, nationally, we are making great strides and gave everyone here a reason to work harder than ever.”  California Republicans are often seen nowadays as a moderate bunch. But the party faithful warmed quickly to Bannon’s message of challenging the Washington establishment.  In fact, Bannon’s address caused more buzz at the convention than did speeches from more traditional conservative figures — House Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield), Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist, and Fox News show host Judge Janine Pirro.  Stepping out from behind the podium, comfortably walking about the stage, Bannon gave a forty-minute-long extemporaneous speech covering a myriad of issues that began with effusive praise of President Donald Trump. He continued by emphasizing the importance of winning and how victories beget victories, and about the great challenge ahead in taking on the “corporatists, lobbyists, consultants, and the politicians they control.”  Bannon’s speech was equal parts praise for President Trump and his policies; a call to action against the GOP establishment; a strong critique of former President George W. Bush and U.S. Senator John McCain (R-AZ)’s recent speeches against Trump; and words of strong encouragement for the activists in the audience.  Sen. Cotton,, a favorite of conservatives, hammered the Democrats who run California’s government for making California a “sanctuary state” for those here in violation of federal immigration laws. He also focused on the massive gas tax recently passed by Democrats in Sacramento. “If you live in West L.A. or San Francisco and you have the money to afford a Tesla, maybe you’ll be OK,” Cotton told delegates. “What about the farmer in the Central Valley who has a pickup truck and needs to fill it up three times a week?”  Rep. McCarthy also praised President Trump — and also, like Cotton, blasted Democrats in Sacramento for their left-wing, progressive agenda. McCarthy also admonished those Republicans in the state legislature who have recently been voting with Democrats, warning that they will not win a majority by being Democrat-light.  While there was a lot of enthusiasm among the delegates present, the road ahead for California Republicans looks rocky. Delegates did pass a change in party rules that allows the party to endorse primary candidates at their next convention, ostensibly to ensure at least one candidate survives the “jungle” primary. However, the next scheduled convention is in early May, long after candidate filing is closed and ballots are printed. In 2016 two Democrats — then-Attorney General Kamala Harris and then-U.S. Rep. Loretta Sanchez — made the runoff for U.S. Senate, with no Republican on the general election ballot. There is a legitimate concern that this will happen again with the governor’s race and U.S. Senate race in 2018.  Moreover, Democrats nationally are targeting about a half-dozen GOP-held House seats in California that voted for Hillary Clinton in the presidential election.  In a somewhat controversial move, convention delegates approved a change in the party’s rules allowing for the party to set up a special account from which to pay the chairman an unspecified salary. Nothing was in that change to the rules that would require any disclosure about what persons or companies are making contributions into that special fund. Up until this point the chairmanship has always been a volunteer-held position.  Jon Fleischman is the Politics Editor for Breitbart California. You can follow him on Twitter here.",17.0,20.0

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan)  WARSAW, Poland (AP) — The difference between Apple’s new iPhone models is a bit like flying first class compared with coach. We envy first class, but coach gets us there without breaking the budget.  The iPhone 8 will do just fine for $300 less than the glitzy iPhone X , even though it won’t make your friends and colleagues jealous. It’s also available much sooner — this Friday — starting at almost $700. The X (read as the numeral 10) won’t be out until November.  Still, the iPhone 8 remains a fairly straightforward update of the iPhone 7 , which itself was a fairly straightforward update of the iPhone 6S. Then again, no one expects much different from a coach seat.  WHAT YOU’RE NOT GETTING  It’s hard to talk about the iPhone 8 without comparing it to my 15 minutes with the iPhone X last Tuesday.  The X wowed with a fancy new display that flows to the edges of the phone. The phone is compact, yet features a screen slightly larger than the one on the supersized iPhone 8 Plus. The X also features facial recognition that lets you unlock the phone with a glance; you can also create animated emojis that match your facial expressions.  AP Deputy Technology Editor Nick Jesdanun describes the pros and cons of the new iPhone 8 that goes on sale this week. (Sept. 19)  The 8 has none of that, although it does share other new goodies the X is getting, including wireless charging. The 8 and the X both have faster processors and sensors to enhance graphics in augmented reality, a blending of the virtual and physical worlds, though older iPhones will also run AR apps with a software update Tuesday.  WIRELESS CHARGING  Apple is embracing wireless-charging technology that Android phones have had for years. It’s a rare case in which Apple isn’t going its own way; instead, it’s adopting an existing standard called Qi (pronounced chee). That means the iPhone gets all the technical advancements from the consortium behind Qi — and can take immediate advantage of a slew of public wireless-charging stations.  It worked perfectly for me while waiting for a connecting flight in Los Angeles — no need to rummage through my backpack for a charging cord.  Apple says the wireless system should charge as quickly as the wall adapter included with iPhones. But I found wireless slower in testing, using a Belkin charger with the same power output as the iPhone charger.  Wireless charging is largely about convenience; it’s terrific if you can just drop your phone on a charging pad overnight or during the day at your desk. Apple says it will boost wireless-charging power by 50 percent in coming months, which will speed things up further. But those in a rush should consider a wall charger that comes with the iPad, which will still be even faster.  In a way, wireless charging makes up for Apple’s earlier decision to ditch the headphone jack in the iPhone 7, which made people share the Lightning port with both charging cords and wired headphones. You can now charge and use wired headphones at the same time.  DISPLAY  Colors on the 8′s screen adapt to lighting in the room. It’s noticeable in my apartment at night, as artificial lighting tends to be warmer and more yellowish. The screen adapts by making whites more like beige and yellow even yellower. It’s softer on the eyes and mimics how light glows on white paper, though it can make images appear less natural. You can turn this feature off.  Resolution isn’t as sharp as what the X and many rival Android phones offer. The Plus offers enough pixels for high-definition video at the highest quality, 1080p, while the regular model is comparable to the lesser 720p.  CAMERA  New color filters produce truer and richer colors without looking fake, while a new flash technique tries to light the foreground and background more evenly. You have to know to look, as the iPhone 7 already had a great camera. Differences in test shots taken while sightseeing in Poland were subtle, but noticeable — more so on the iPhone 8 screen than on last year’s Mac.  The iPhone 8 also offers additional video options, including recording of ultra-high definition, or 4K, at 60 frames per second, twice the previous rate. (The phone’s display, though, isn’t sharp enough for 4K.)  A second lens in the 7 Plus and 8 Plus models lets the camera gauge depth and blur backgrounds in portrait shots, something once limited to full-featured SLR cameras. Samsung adopted that feature in this year’s Note 8 .  Coming to the 8 Plus are filters to mimic studio and other lighting conditions. My favorite, stage light, highlights the subject’s face and darkens the background. Some of these filters make images look fake — Apple has slapped a “beta” test tag to signal it’s not flawless. You can try them out and undo any changes you don’t like.  DESIGN  To make wireless charging work, the 8 features a glass back, something last seen in the iPhone 4S in 2011. Aesthetic considerations aside, this gives you another sheet of glass to break.  Apple says custom glass from Corning makes the phone stronger. Even so, consider a service plan and get a case. Wireless charging works with most cases, as long as there’s no metal or magnets. I found the phone charged just as fast with the case on.  ABOUT THAT PRICE TAG  The iPhone 8 is about $50 more than what the iPhone 7 cost at launch. Samsung has similarly increased the prices of its flagship Galaxy phones, and the S8 still outsold last year’s S7. Consumers seem willing to pay.  You do get double the storage — 64 gigabytes — at that price, a value considering that iPhone storage boosts typically cost $100. You’ll need that extra storage for video, apps and fancy features such as AR and animated photos.  Nonetheless, I would have preferred the option of a cheaper, lower-storage version. For that, you need an older model , such as the $549 iPhone 7 and the $449 6S. There’s also the smaller iPhone SE for $349.",5.0,6.0
1403,3014,10,26,2017,2017-10-26,Vox,Even climate deniers seem to think Scott Pruitt is bullshitting,"EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has said that he wants “true, legitimate, peer-reviewed, objective, transparent discussion” of climate change — something that, in his opinion, the US has never had.  He has proposed a “red-team, blue-team” exercise, modeled on military and cybersecurity decision-making, with one team making the case for climate change (its reality and urgency) and one team against. A series of public exchanges between these teams, he said in a recent interview, would be like “peer review happening in real time.”  Anyone with any faith or confidence in American scientific institutions and practices will recognize that this is terrible idea. But here’s the funny thing. They’re not the only ones.  Guess who said this: “EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt’s proposal for a Red Team-Blue Team exercise is vague, probably would not be effective, and is unlikely to come about.”  That’s Joseph Bast, CEO of the Heartland Institute, a think tank specializing in climate denial, recording his impressions in a leaked email to staff after discussing the red-team idea with Pruitt.  Bast and the fellow deniers in his circle would very much like a public debate of climate science — they are nothing if not true believers. But if there is to be one, Bast said, it will likely come from some other agency “with more interest than Pruitt has shown in the scientific debate and more likely to stick around to see the results.”  Ouch.  The question before us, then, is this: just how much of a party hack do you have to be for the Heartland guy to see that you’re bullshitting?  That is the subject I would like to explore with you here today.  Pruitt has strong but vague reservations about EPA’s climate science  In 2007’s Mass v. EPA, the Supreme Court found that carbon dioxide is eligible for classification as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act. That means that, if CO2 is found to be a threat to public health, EPA has a legal obligation to regulate it.  In 2008 and 2009, the agency conducted an exhaustive examination of the question. It drew on hundreds of scientists and experts to review the literature and took hundreds of thousands of public comments. Its responses to those comments run 11 volumes, more than 500 pages.  In its 2009 Endangerment Finding, the agency concluded, along with every reputable scientific organization that has ever investigated the question, that yes, CO2 is a danger to humans. The technical support document EPA released alongside the report is just shy of 200 pages, devoted entirely to documenting technical and scientific claims, linking to more than 100 peer-reviewed scientific papers.  Scott Pruitt, meanwhile, is an Oklahoma lawyer.  Nonetheless, in an interview with Time this week, he cast doubt on his own agency’s finding. ""Did this agency engage in a robust, meaningful discussion with respect to the endangerment that CO2 poses to this country?"" Pruitt asked, rhetorically. ""I think by any definition of that process they didn't.""  He did not elaborate, or offer any details on what a better process might look like. Nor did he say exactly how many volumes of comments, responses, and scientific studies it would take to meet his definition of “robust, meaningful discussion.”  A cynic might suspect that he’s just BSing. And Bast’s reaction after talking to him more or less confirms it.  When Heartland dismisses you as unserious ... well, to fully appreciate that, let’s take a closer look at what’s going on the in the world of climate denial these days.  How climate denialists plan to win  Along with being one of the last, stalwart defenders of alcohol and tobacco, Heartland has carried the sputtering torch of climate denial through the long, dark Obama years. Much has changed in the past two decades, in politics and in science, but for the most part, the arguments of the hardcore climate deniers have not. It was “actually, CO2 is good” in 1998 ... and that’s what it is today. (For a rebuttal of this age-old talking point, see Skeptical Science.)  Heartland’s persistence has now been rewarded: It has a conduit to the White House. It is sending recommendations to Pruitt for his “red team,” scientists and economists who dissent from the broad scientific consensus.  Led by Heartland, a group of around 40 conservative scientists, lawyers, and economists came together for a series of meetings about the red-team process. CEO Joe Bast later sent the notes from the September 28 meeting to his staff. The email leaked — E&E got a copy.  It is fascinating, not only for the dismissive attitude toward Pruitt.  A communications consultant concluded that “The best messages are positive: CO2 increases crop yields, the earth is greening.” Attendees were urged to “stop chasing the other side’s latest argument and focus instead on the benefits of CO2.”  Other select bullet points worth sharing (quoting directly, brackets mine):  —push Pruitt to start a proceeding for reconsideration of the Endangerment Finding ... he won’t do it without pressure. —get good people onto EPA advisory boards and into the administration. [Pruitt is in the midst of trying to stack his scientific advisory boards with industry representatives.] —conduct a new survey of scientists to refute the 97% consensus claims. [Like I said, they really, really believe what they say.] —never use the phrases “windmill farms,” “all of the above,” “carbon pollution,” “social cost of carbon,” or “air pollution.” —use “industrial windmills,” “reliable and affordable,” “carbon dioxide emissions,” “benefits and costs of fossil fuels,” and “air quality.” —fundamentally challenge, reform, or replace the National Academy of Sciences, the source of much pseudoscience. —insist EPA et al. use 7% as the discount rate in their estimates of the social cost of carbon. [See here for more on the lunacy of that proposal.] —the cost of government failure exceeds the “market failure” supposedly captured by the SCC, so every dollar raised by a “carbon tax” will produce more social harm than good.  But wait, best of all:  —sue a company for not increasing CO2 emissions, force a court to consider the evidence on CO2 benefits.  Good luck with that.  US—#ClimateDeniers—“might sue companies for not emitting more CO2”—Heartland Institute, funded by undisclosed donors https://t.co/8hpevFpfH5 — Sara Laughter (@GreenAwakening) October 23, 2017  There is no blog post in the world long enough to rebut all of this nonsense, but the moral of the story for Pruitt is: If the Heartland guy is dismissing you as a hack who doesn’t really care about climate science ... you are something special.  (Bast did not respond to a request for comment.)  Pruitt sits for a lovefest with the state press  There’s more, though. Pruitt is notoriously secretive and paranoid. The EPA has recently been bumping critical journalists off its mailing lists.  I no longer get all of the EPA's press materials. It's a nightmare to get basic facts on their activities and I suspect that's on purpose https://t.co/QYfUZwWYfR — Rebecca Leber (@rebleber) October 10, 2017  But Pruitt really opens up when he talks with others in the conservative movements — outlets like Breitbart that will convey his message uncut.  Which brings us to this long, amazing interview Pruitt just did with the Heritage Foundation, another of the interchangeable and seemingly permanent right-wing think tanks that litter DC. It must be seen in its fullness to be believed. With its lickspittle questions and cheerful disinformation, it feels like nothing so much as North Korean state press.  Reporters like @rebleber & @AlexCKaufman get iced out by the EPA. Heritage gets to ask Pruitt questions like this: https://t.co/bd5eWVQBHv pic.twitter.com/3fxm0CTPb3 — Kate Scareonoff (@KateAronoff) October 20, 2017  Expanding on this theme — that Obama forced a choice between jobs and the environment — Pruitt says environmentalists want, uh, a fence around the orchard:  It would be like having this beautiful apple orchard that can feed the world and the environmental folks of the past would say, ‘Build a fence. Don’t touch the apple orchard, though it can feed people.’ That’s not the proper approach. They would say it’s so pristine and we shouldn’t touch it. That’s not what we should do. We should harvest that apple orchard.  This is what it sounds when you describe environmentalists from inside the conservative bubble, based on lurid Fox News stereotypes, having rarely or never actually talked with one.  For the record, oil and gas production rose precipitously under Obama. Lots of apples got picked! Also, here’s Obama’s EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy in 2013:  For too long we have been focused on a false choice: between the health of our children and the health of our economy — and we have endlessly debated that choice even in the face of 43 years of documented history that proved that it just ain’t so. Today, the truth we need to embrace is that cutting carbon pollution will spark business innovation, will grow jobs, and will strengthen the economy.  McCarthy, like every EPA leader in US history, explicitly denies the choice that Pruitt says she forced on America.  The funny thing is, Pruitt even does the typical conservative thing of praising all the environmental progress the US has made through previous regulations. He notes that “since 1980, there are certain pollutants that we regulate under the Clean Air Act, criteria pollutants, they are called. … We’ve reduced those pollutants over 65 percent since 1980, but we’ve also grown our [gross domestic product] substantially.”  Exactly! Back then, the Pruitts of the day said the Clean Air Act would destroy the economy. It didn’t, a fact the Pruitts of today now celebrate. The same pattern holds true for more or less every air-quality regulation EPA has passed. Conservatives predict economic doom; the economy remains robust; future conservatives join in celebrating our wisdom.  And then they predict that any new air-quality regulations will destroy the economy. Lo, let the circle be unbroken.  When asked about climate change, Pruitt first cites his new plan to purge EPA scientific advisory boards of most of their qualified experts, by pretending that any scientist who has received government funding is forever tainted and biased.  As to climate change itself, he is careful to skirt outright denial. He’s just not sure, is all. He wants a discussion, is all. “An objective, transparent, honest discussion about what we know and what we don’t know, with respect to CO2,” he says, has “never taken place.”  Never taken place! The science isn’t just wrong. It doesn’t exist.  It goes on and on like this, just blithe, Orwellian up-is-downism, with Heritage guy hoovering it down, responding with such probing follow-up questions as, “What is your strategy for rolling back cumbersome regulations that hurt small businesses?”  Pruitt talks glowingly of programs that his administration’s budget proposes to slash by a third. He blames the previous administration for “regulatory uncertainty” caused by lawsuits he filed. He lies about what the Supreme Court said about the Clean Power Plan (it did not weigh in on the merits), lies about what the CPP would do (not “declare war on a sector of the economy”), claims, bizarrely, that pollution regulations should not target any particular fuels or sources (not even the ones polluting?), and talks with genuine enthusiasm about the “partnerships” he’s going to strike with big industries and conservative state AGs.  He says he has “tried to exercise good will” in working with career EPA staff, though he has shown dozens of them the door, he doesn’t talk to the ones who are left, he meets almost exclusively with industry representatives, and his private security force is now up to 30 — 30! — and counting.  As for Donald Trump? “I seek every day, and I mean this sincerely, to bless him,” Pruitt says, presumably with a nervous glance at the recorder on the table. “I want to bless him and the decisions he’s making.’  Yes. Bless the Dear Leader and the decisions He is making. Bless His science, may it smite the corrupt government science. Bless His friends in industry, may they flourish under deregulation. Bless His budget cuts, may they unleash glorious prosperity. And above all, bless His very name, may he not smite me until I’m sitting in Jim Inhofe’s Senate seat.",11.0,3.0

On Friday in Tokyo -- ahead of her father's upcoming Asia trip -- that meant advocating for women and minorities in the working world and speaking out against sexual harassment.  The first daughter used her appearance at the World Assembly for Women summit to champion female and minority contributions in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM).  “Female and minority participation in STEM fields is moving in the wrong direction,"" Ivanka Trump said, according to Reuters. ""We must create equal participation in these traditionally male-dominated sectors of our economy.""  But she also addressed the torrent of sexual harassment and misconduct allegations back home, involving figures from business, media, entertainment and government.  ""All too often, our workplace culture fails to treat women with appropriate respect,"" she told her Japanese audience about American society, Agence France-Presse reported. ""This takes many forms, including harassment, which can never be tolerated.""  Perhaps in deference to Ivanka Trump, Tokyo's Metropolitan Police Department deployed an all-female security team to guard America's first daughter, the Asahi Shimbun reported. Instead of bulky body armor, the women officers sported black suits.  Ivanka's speech came just days before President Trump and first lady Melania Trump were scheduled to arrive in Japan for a three-day visit beginning Sunday. The tour also will include stops in South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines.  In her speech, Ivanka also touted her father’s push at home for tax reform, Reuters reported.  “We are seeking to simplify the tax code, lower rates, expand the child tax credit, eliminate the marriage penalty, and put more money back in the pockets of hard-working Americans,” she said.  Ivanka's Tokyo appearance put significant distance between herself and a report by Newsweek that she had used a private email account to communicate with the U.S. Treasury Department while employed by the White House.  The magazine cited information obtained via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request made by nonprofit organization American Oversight.  The email data also revealed that Ivanka and husband Jared Kushner were invited to a weekly “Economic Principals Lunch” hosted by Trump’s top economic adviser Gary Cohn in his office.Other attendees included Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.

Pastor Tom Brown of the First Baptist Church of Gallant says Moore has attended the church in Gallant, Ala. for most of his life. He added the community is close-knit and extremely proud of Moore’s run for the Senate, but noted the reported allegations of sexual misconduct have taken a toll on the former judge.  “He’s hurt about what’s been said about him,” Brown told Fox News on Sunday. “He says it’s untrue and I believe it’s untrue because I’ve known him for 25 years.”  As a staunch conservative, Moore has grown a following in the state with Christian conservatives. Brown says Moore attends church at least a few times a month when his schedule allows, but there was no sighting of the candidate ‪on Sunday morning.  Several church members told Fox News that Moore and his family were well-liked in the community.  Daphney Gray attends Moore’s church and said he and his family have been very welcoming to her and her family.  “I have heard things, but I don’t let other people’s opinion sway my opinion,” Gray, who lives in Gallant, said. “I just deal with the man that I see on Sundays and how he has treated my family since we’ve been here.”  Several prominent Republicans including President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have called on Moore to step down if the allegations are true.

A computer server crucial to a lawsuit against Georgia election officials was quietly wiped clean in July 2017, just after the suit was filed. Data on the server could have indicated whether Georgia elections were manipulated by malicious hackers. (AP Photo/Alex Sanz, File)  A computer server crucial to a lawsuit against Georgia election officials was quietly wiped clean by its custodians just after the suit was filed, The Associated Press has learned.  The server’s data was destroyed July 7 by technicians at the Center for Elections Systems at Kennesaw State University, which runs the state’s election system. The data wipe was revealed in an email sent last week from an assistant state attorney general to plaintiffs in the case that was later obtained by the AP. More emails obtained in a public records request confirmed the wipe.  The lawsuit, filed July 3 by a diverse group of election reform advocates, aims to force Georgia to retire its antiquated and heavily criticized election technology. The server in question, which served as a statewide staging location for key election-related data, made national headlines in June after a security expert disclosed a gaping security hole that wasn’t fixed six months after he reported it to election authorities.  WIPED OUT  It’s not clear who ordered the server’s data irretrievably erased.  The Kennesaw elections center answers to Georgia’s secretary of state, Brian Kemp, a Republican running for governor in 2018 and the suit’s main defendant. His spokeswoman issued a statement Thursday saying his office had neither involvement nor advanced warning of the decision. It blamed “the undeniable ineptitude” at the Kennesaw State elections center.  After declining comment for more than 24 hours, Kennesaw State’s media office issued a statement late Thursday attributing the server wiping to “standard operating procedure.” It did not respond to the AP’s question on who ordered the action.  Plaintiffs in the lawsuit, mostly Georgia voters, want to scrap the state’s 15-year-old vote-management system — particularly its 27,000 AccuVote touchscreen voting machines, hackable devices that don’t use paper ballots or keep hardcopy proof of voter intent. The plaintiffs were counting on an independent security review of the Kennesaw server, which held elections staging data for counties, to demonstrate the system’s unreliability.  Wiping the server “forestalls any forensic investigation at all,” said Richard DeMillo, a Georgia Tech computer scientist following the case. “People who have nothing to hide don’t behave this way.”  STATE SECURITY  The server data could have revealed whether Georgia’s most recent elections were compromised by hackers. The plaintiffs contend results of both last November’s election and a special June 20 congressional runoff— won by Kemp’s predecessor, Karen Handel — cannot be trusted.  Possible Russian interference in U.S. politics, including attempts to penetrate voting systems, has been an acute national preoccupation since the Obama administration sounded the alarm more than a year ago.  Kemp and his GOP allies insist Georgia’s elections system is secure. But Marilyn Marks, executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, a plaintiff, believes server data was erased precisely because the system isn’t secure.  “I don’t think you could find a voting systems expert who would think the deletion of the server data was anything less than insidious and highly suspicious,” she said.  NOW YOU SEE IT, NOW YOU DON’T  It could still be possible to recover relevant information from the server.  The FBI is known to have made an exact data image of the server in March when it investigated the security hole. The Oct. 18 email disclosing the server wipe said the state attorney general’s office was “reaching out to the FBI to determine whether they still have the image” and also disclosed that two backup servers were wiped clean Aug. 9, just as the lawsuit moved to federal court.  On Wednesday, the attorney general’s office notified the court of its intent to subpoena the FBI seeking the image.  Atlanta FBI spokesman Stephen Emmett would not say if that image still exists. Nor would he say whether agents examined it to determine whether the server’s files might have been altered by unauthorized users.  FAILING TO SERVICE THE SERVER  A 180-page collection of Kennesaw State emails, obtained Friday by the Coalition for Good Governments via an open records search, details the destruction of the data on all three servers and a partial and ultimately ineffective effort by Kennesaw State systems engineers to fix the main server’s security hole.  As a result of the failed effort, sensitive data on Georgia’s 6.7 million voters — including Social Security numbers, party affiliation and birthdates — as well as passwords used by county officials to access elections management files remained exposed for months.  The problem was first discovered by Atlanta security researcher Logan Lamb while doing online research in August 2016. He informed the election center’s director at the time, noting in an email “there is a strong possibility your site is already compromised.”  Based on his review of the emails, Lamb believes that electronic polling books could have been altered in Georgia’s biggest counties to add or drop voters or to scramble their data. Malicious hackers could have altered the templates of voting machine memory cards to skew results. An attacker could even have potentially modified “ballot-building” files to corrupt the outcome, said Lamb, who works at Atlanta-based security firm Bastille Networks.  THE BIGGER PICTURE  Though striking, the wayward election server is seen as just part of a much larger problem.  The Department of Homeland Security says 21 states had elections systems scanned or penetrated by Russia-backed hackers last year, though there’s no evidence they altered voting outcomes.  But computer security experts say it’s possible Russians or other malicious actors have sown undetected booby traps in the highly decentralized U.S. voting landscape. In June, a leaked National Security Agency memo showed that 122 elections officials in various states were targeted with phishing emails crafted by Russian agents intent on stealing their passwords.  CALL TO INVESTIGATE  Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr was urged Thursday to investigate. GOP state Rep. Scot Turner: “They should go and look at who did it and why they did it and see ... whether there was criminal intent.” Carr’s office declined comment.  Georgia U.S. Rep Hank Johnson, a Democrat, separately said the server wipe “appears to be a willful and premeditated destruction of evidence” by election officials, adding, “Georgia voters should be as outraged as I am.”  Sara Henderson, executive director of Common Cause Georgia, noted Kemp has repeatedly denied involvement in the university’s decisions on voting machine security.  “Georgia is not creating a climate of voting integrity for our citizens by continuing to blame shift,” Henderson said via email.  ___  Frank Bajak on Twitter: http://twitter.com/fbajak",38.0,40.0
1004,2562,10,25,2017,2017-10-25,Breitbart,"Hillary Campaign, DNC Accused of Violating Election Law with Dossier Payments","The Campaign Legal Center (CLC), a Washington, DC-based election law non-profit, filed a complaint with the Federal Election Committee (FEC) Wednesday over Hillary for America and the Democratic National Committee’s (DNC) conduct in commissioning the infamous “pee-pee dossier.”  According to the CLC, the Clinton campaign and the DNC violated federal law when they “failed to accurately disclose the purpose and recipient of payments for the dossier of research alleging connections between then-candidate Donald Trump and Russia, effectively hiding these payments from public scrutiny.”  The complaint alleges:  [T]he DNC and Hillary for America reported dozens of payments totaling millions of dollars to the law firm Perkins Coie with the purpose described as “Legal Services” or “Legal Compliance Consulting,” when in reality, those payments were earmarked for the firm Fusion GPS, with the purpose of conducting opposition research on Donald Trump.  Citing FEC statements of policy that the “purpose of disbursement” section on campaign disclosure forms “must be sufficiently specific to make the purpose of the disbursement clear,” CLC is arguing these facts constitute a violation of federal election law.  By no means a right-leaning organization, the officially non-partisan CLC, has taken donations from left-wing activist billionaire George Soros, is still partly funded by a Soros family foundation, and lists opposing the effects of the Citizens United decision as part of its raison d’etre.  The group is most well-known in conservative circles for playing a leading role in urging Lois Lerner’s IRS to investigate Tea Party groups in 2010 and 2011. The CLC recently filed an IRS complaint against Alabama U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore’s religious foundation and hired a prominent Obama administration official as its senior ethics director.  Any citizen or group may make a complaint to the FEC, which, if it finds reason to believe the complaint raises serious likelihood of election law violations, begins its own investigation.  Perkins Cole attorney Marc Elias repeatedly lied to mainstream media reporters investigating the dossier, denying long-running rumors that Hillary Clinton and Democrats were behind the document then-FBI Director James Comey called “salacious and unverified.” The Washington Post confirmed those rumors were entirely true Tuesday in a bombshell report that further collapses the Trump-Russia collusion narrative.  In that narrative’s place, one of wrongdoing and perhaps collusion with Russian intelligence officials on the part of Democrats, Clinton campaign surrogates, and possibly, given reports of FBI payments to the dossier’s creator, elements of the Obama era Justice Department, is forming.  Wednesday’s CLC complaint adds another element to allegations of election law violations amid the clouds brewing over Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign’s conduct.",18.0,22.0

Governors of 19 Western states are pressing the federal government to do more to prevent the spread of damage-causing invasive mussels from infected federally managed waterways. (AP Photo/Felicia Fonseca, File)  BOISE, Idaho (AP) — Governors of 19 Western states are pressing the federal government to do more to prevent the spread of damage-causing invasive mussels from infected federally managed waterways.  The Western Governors’ Association on Thursday sent a letter urging Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to put in place by spring 2018 controls to prevent the spread of zebra and quagga mussels.  The governors are also asking that federal agencies conduct mandatory inspections and decontamination of boats leaving infected water bodies. The mussels can attach to boats and trailers and travel long distances, clogging water pipes, damaging boat motors and affecting other aquatic life.  “Given the significant risks that quagga and zebra mussels pose to uninfested waterbodies, it is critical to implement effective control policies in a timely manner,” the letter states.  The governors say they’re particularly concerned about the mussels reaching the Columbia River Basin, Lake Tahoe, and the Colorado River Basin above Lake Powell.  The Interior Department has said that hydroelectric projects infested with the mussels might require an additional $500,000 in annual maintenance. The Pacific Northwest gets much of its power from hydro projects, so an infestation could increase the cost of electricity.  Many states have spent millions and continue to do so to keep the mussels out. Some have set up mandatory checkpoints near borders to intercept boats for inspections, including Idaho, which is spending more than $3 million annually.  “Idaho and our neighbors in the West are acting individually and collaboratively to address the challenge of these invasive species,” Idaho Gov. C.L. “Butch” Otter said in a statement to The Associated Press on Friday. “Now our federal partners must step up to help us stop further infestations.”  Heather Swift, Interior Department spokeswoman, said in an email to The Associated Press on Friday that Zinke hadn’t seen the letter and couldn’t comment specifically.  “Stopping the spread of invasive species is a big concern of the Department and the Secretary,” she said, noting a June 26 news release outlining some of the agency’s collaborative efforts with states and tribal agencies.  The governors’ letter on Thursday is the second they’ve sent this year about invasive mussels to Zinke. A letter sent June 22 also pressed for watercraft inspection and decontamination.  The Interior Department responded Sept. 15 with a two-page letter agreeing with the severity of the problem. The most recent letter by the governors’ included “clarifying questions.”  Specifically, the governors want to know what timeline has been set for the National Park Service to complete an assessment of mussel containment and monitoring programs at Lake Mead National Recreation Area in southeastern Nevada and northwestern Arizona, and the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area in southern Utah and northern Arizona.  The governors are also interested in knowing if similar timelines are being set for other Interior Department agencies, including the Bureau of Land Management and Bureau of Reclamation.  The governors also asked if federal agencies have the authority to require mandatory boat checks and, if not, what authority would be needed.  “Western states need adequate measures to ensure these invaders do not spread to uninfested waters,” the governors said.",11.0,11.0
725,2139,10,17,2017,2017-10-17,Fox News,US looking to Japan for help in boosting LNG exports to Asia,"The U.S. is keen to work with Japan in expanding exports of U.S. liquefied natural gas in Asia, and hopes for more Japanese investment in American natural gas infrastructure, a senior Department of Energy official said Wednesday.  Japan's trade and industry minister announced Wednesday plans for a $10 billion public-private effort to build LNG terminals, power plants and other facilities to help meet rising energy demand in Asia.  ""The global demand for liquefied natural gas is rising sharply and the expansionary trend will continue for a while, mainly in Asia,"" Hiroshige Seko, ministry of the economy, trade and industry, told a conference in Tokyo.  Seko also said Japan hoped to build a market for price setting of LNG, long an issue of concern for the world's largest importer of natural gas. Japan's imports soared after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami along its northeastern coast triggered meltdowns that led to the shutdowns of all its nuclear reactors. Only a few have been restarted.  U.S. Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette, who is visiting Tokyo, described Japan's plan to support investments in LNG facilities as ""fantastic.""  ""I thanked Minister Seko personally for that announcement today,"" he said. ""We see Japan not only as a customer but a valued partner and investor in our infrastructure.""  Many of the fastest growing markets in the Asian-Pacific region lack terminals and other infrastructure needed to increase their LNG imports.  Exports of natural gas from the U.S. were restricted for decades but such limits have loosened and the Trump administration is pushing for increased energy exports.  Japan has been importing LNG from Alaska since 1969. But the first international shipment of liquefied natural gas in decades from the Lower 48 states was shipped to Brazil from Louisiana just last year. Earlier this month, India received its first ever shipment of U.S. natural gas.  Efforts to expand LNG facilities needed to handle those exports on the west coast of the U.S. have run into opposition from local communities that object to such large projects on environmental grounds.  Energy Secretary Rick Perry has said energy companies seeking to export LNG from huge terminals in Texas, Louisiana and other states will be able to do so if they meet requirements.",38.0,64.0
1461,3108,11,6,2017,2017-11-06,Breitbart,"Pakistan Establishes Agency to Monitor, Block Blasphemous Content Online","Islamabad has doubled down on enforcing Pakistan’s strict and controversial anti-Islamic blasphemy law, forming a regulatory body to monitor and block blasphemous content in cyberspace.  “Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), the government-run communications regulatory agency, has created a 25-member group tasked with cracking down on websites, social media accounts and online pages that they consider offensive to Islam,” reports Voice of America (VOA).  “The committee, being constituted by the Ministry of Interior, will include representatives from PTA, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), and the ministry,” revealed Ismail Shah, the PTA’s chairman, when speaking to a Pakistan parliament panel.  In May, PTA officials reportedly warned millions of Pakistan resident via text message not to post or share blasphemous content online, which involves anything seen as an explicit insult to Allah, Islam, or religious leaders.  Social media companies such are Facebook and Twitter are allegedly doing little to stop Pakistan’s efforts to crackdown on anti-Islamic content online.  Pakistani government officials have reportedly accused Facebook of assisting Islamabad in taking down such content.  The Muslim-majority country’s blasphemy law is primarily used to target religious minorities, namely Christians, according to several analysts, including the British Pakistani Christian Association (BPCA), which tracks cases of Christian persecution in Pakistan.  Blasphemy criminal cases seldom result in a fair trial, often leading to the harsh verdict of life in prison or death mandated by the statue.  The first blasphemy-linked death sentence affiliated with social media surfaced earlier this year.  A Pakistani court found Taimoor Raza, 30, guilty of insulting the prophet Muhammad.  “Raza was arrested last year after a debate about Islam on Facebook with a man who turned out to be a counter-terrorism agent,” reported the Guardian. “He was one among 15 people arrested by the counter-terrorism department last year, accused of blasphemy, according to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan.”  Although the Pakistani government has not yet carried out a blasphemy-related death sentence, Islamic extremists in the country have taken their version of justice into their hands  Mukhtar Masih, a 70-year-old Pakistani Christian arrested on charges of blasphemy earlier this year, recently died before he could face trial.  Christians as young as eight years old have been accused of insulting Islam in one way or another in Pakistan, where an estimated 100 people are reportedly detained on such charges each year.  The law appears to be popular among the predominantly Muslim population. Pakistanis often rally in favor of punishing those accused of blaspheming.  Nevertheless, VOA notes, “As government is committed to scrutinizing online contents, some rights activists charge that monitoring the internet will be a slippery slope.”  “The monitoring of social media for blasphemous content is a dangerous precedent in Pakistan. The law has often been misused in the past and now a crackdown on internet will further complicate the situation,” Zohra Yusuf, a Pakistani human rights activist, told Voice of America.  VOA learned that Pakistan might be using the controversial law as a pretext to silence dissent on the internet.",5.0,4.0
1082,2660,10,27,2017,2017-10-27,Vox,Political journalism has been profoundly shaped by men like Leon Wieseltier and Mark Halperin,"When I arrived in Washington in 2005, Mark Halperin and Leon Wieseltier occupied the commanding heights of political journalism. Halperin was the editor of ABC’s the Note, a daily political news digest that the New Yorker called “the most influential tip sheet in Washington.” Wieseltier was the philosopher-king editing the New Republic’s arts and culture section, but his influence extended deep into the rest of the magazine, and into liberal journalism broadly. As Halperin defined the conventional wisdom of the political elite, Wieseltier defined it for the liberal intelligentsia — he was, wrote Vanity Fair, Washington’s “aesthetic and moral arbiter.”  In recent days, Halperin and Wieseltier have been accused of serial sexual harassment and predation. Numerous women have come forward to accuse Halperin of behavior ranging from demanding they sit on his lap to discuss their reporting to rubbing his erections on them (Halperin denies the charges). Wieseltier’s behavior, meanwhile, was so known that ex-New Republic editor Michelle Cottle says it can’t even be described as an open secret — “it was simply out in the open.” Wieseltier was lecherous, objectifying, demeaning, and bullying. He leered at his female employees, groped and kissed them at work functions, left them thank-you notes for wearing miniskirts to the office, and humiliated them when they rejected his advances.  What does it mean that these men — and so many others liked them — held the power to literally shape America’s political narrative? What does it mean, as New York magazine’s Rebecca Traister noted on Twitter, that the story of, say, Hillary Clinton’s public career was told by these sorts of men?  One does not need to dig very deep into Halperin and Wieseltier’s work to find echoes of their private behavior in their public comments. “For Leon, women fell on a spectrum ranging from Humorless Prig to Game Girl, based on how much of his sexual banter, innuendo, and advances she would put up with,” writes Cottle. It’s an observation that sheds considerable light on Wieseltier’s oft-expressed contempt for Clinton. In 2007, Wieseltier told the New York Times that she was “like some hellish housewife who has seen something that she really, really wants and won’t stop nagging you about it until finally you say, fine, take it, be the damn president, just leave me alone.”  Halperin, for his part, dismissed reports that Donald Trump had groped, demeaned, and harassed women over the course of his long life in the public eye. “If that's the best they got on these issues and Donald Trump, Donald Trump should be celebrating that story,” Halperin said on MSNBC. “There's some troubling things in the piece, but there's nothing illegal, there's nothing even kind of, like, beyond boorish or politically incorrect.”  It’s 2017, and the United States of America has never elected a woman president. Congress is less than 20 percent female. Only three of Trump’s 16 Cabinet officials are women. Clinton, for her part, struggled with persistent claims that there was just something unlikable, something grating, something shrill about her. She was often told to smile more, to stop shouting. She ran against a lying boor who was, for all his faults, lauded for speaking from the gut and appearing to enjoy himself on the campaign trail, while she was criticized for appearing too diligent, too earnest, too calculated. Strikingly, the same claims made against Clinton are now being made against Elizabeth Warren.  We routinely underestimate what it means that our political system has been constructed and interpreted by men, that our expectations for politicians have been set by generations of male politicians and shaped by generations of male pundits. “Just the way that he talked about prominent women, it was clear they were second tier to male intellectuals,” one ex-New Republic staffer told Splinter of Wieseltier.  The most influential institutions in America have long had serial sexual abusers and deep misogynists at their apex. Those abusers didn’t just shape their workplaces or their industries; they shaped our politics, our culture, and our country.",5.0,6.0
1458,3105,11,5,2017,2017-11-05,Breitbart,"SNL’s Alec Baldwin Victim-Blames Rose McGowan, Lashes Out at Alleged Rape Victim Asia Argento","Late last week, in an apparent attempt to inoculate himself from the nuclear Harvey Weinstein scandal, Saturday Night Live’s Alec Baldwin admitted he has “bullied women.” Baldwin seemed all-too eager to prove himself correct Saturday by victim-blaming Rose McGowan and then lashing out at alleged-Weinstein rape victim Asia Argento.  During a Friday appearance on PBS, Baldwin dropped the bombshell that for decades he had heard rumors about McGowan being raped by Weinstein, that he heard these rumors “over and over … for decades and nothing was done.”  At this point the PBS interviewer says somewhat accusingly, “and nobody said anything.” Baldwin then explained why he said nothing by blaming McGowan for taking a settlement in 1997, instead of going to the authorities. Then Baldwin admits he did not know until now that she had taken the settlement:  What happened was that Rose McGowan took a payment of $100,000 and settled her case with him, and it was for Rose McGowan to prosecute that case … I had no idea, until now, that she had settled the case … Do the settlement of these cases hurt the cause of exposing and bringing us to a place of real change? When women take money and are silenced by that money, even though they took the money and were silenced because they were told, beyond the money, it was the right thing for them to do — keep quiet, don’t make too many waves, it is going to hurt your career. When they do it, nonetheless, does it set back the cause of change?  Baldwin’s logic here is off-the-charts nuts.  To begin with, let us never forget the 1990s, and how women were treated by the national media if they dared accuse a powerful Democrat, a close friend of the Clintons (as Weinstein was), of anything.  With the ruthless help of the national political media, most especially CNN, woman after woman after Kathleen Willey after Juanita Broaddrick after Paula Jones after Monica Lewinsky, were personally destroyed by Bill and Hillary Clinton.  Secondly, McGowan was just 23 years old.  Imagine, through no fault of your own, being thrust into the black heart of a well-oiled Hollywood Payoff Machine when you are just 23. Here is just the tip of an iceberg McGowan was witnessing in the national media during that dark time…  ABC’s Sam Donaldson demeaning Clinton mistress Gennifer Flowers as “some failed cabaret singer who doesn’t even have much of a resume to fall back on.”  Newsweek’s Evan Thomas on a DC talk show smearing Paula Jones as “some sleazy woman with big hair coming out of the trailer parks.”  CNN favorite James Carville grabbing the Newsweek baton with, “Drag a hundred dollars through a trailer park and there’s no telling what you’ll find.”  The entire elite infrastructure in Washington DC and the media, something Weinstein was comfortably a part of, had all of its guns trained on any woman who dared speak out. The media even remained on Clinton’s side after the IRS went after Paula Jones.  On top of this national climate, McGowan is being told that if she dares speak out against the most powerful man in Hollywood, no one will believe her, she will be personally destroyed, and her career will be ruined.  Did I mention that she was just 23 years old?  God bless her for demanding some form of justice from Weinstein.

558,1950,10,13,2017,2017-10-13,Vox,Americans are willing to pay $177 a year to avoid climate change,"Despite their relatively rarity in the real world, carbon taxes are the subject of endless hype and discussion in the climate-policy world.  That hype was reinvigorated last year with the introduction of a carbon tax proposal from the Climate Leadership Council, a bipartisan group that boasts several prominent (retired) Republicans among its founding members, including James Baker and George Schultz, along with a number of fossil fuel companies.  Though it didn’t go anywhere — if you’ve checked in on Congress lately, you will understand why — the CLC proposal has taken on a kind of elevated status in Washington, DC. It is now viewed as the model of what a bipartisan carbon tax should look like, should such a thing should ever become politically viable. (Weirder things have happened.)  But hang on. The CLC pitches its proposal on the premise that it will appeal to the broadest possible swathe of the public, across partisan lines. Is that true? Does it actually line up with public preferences?  Turns out, maybe not.  Designing a carbon tax requires answering two core policy questions. First, how much money should it raise? And second, how should the money be spent?  As to the first, the CLC proposal starts at $40 a ton and rises $5 a year. As to the second, the revenue goes to dividends, i.e., it is distributed back to citizens on a per-capita basis. (It’s a dividend of roughly $2,000 a year for a family of four, to begin with.) Policies like this are called “tax-and-dividend.”  Is that what the public wants?  It’s funny you should ask. The Yale Program on Climate Change Communication recently completed a large-scale survey of the public on this subject. The results were just published in the journal Environmental Research Letters.  Researchers asked a representative sample of 1,226, American adults questions seeking to determine two things. First, how much are Americans willing to pay per year to fight climate change? And second, what would they prefer government do with the revenue?  It’s the answers to the second question I want to highlight, but let’s look at the first really quickly.  How much are Americans willing to pay a year to fight climate change? $177.  To get at the first subject, researchers took an interesting approach. They did not simply ask, “would you support a carbon tax, and if so how big?”  Rather, they phrased the first question this way: “If a tax on fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) to help reduce global warming were to cost your household $X more each year in higher energy bills, would you support or oppose it?” Respondents were randomly assigned values of X.  Based on those binary yes-no answers, the researchers used some statistical hoodoo to determine overall “willingness to pay” (WTP). The results: “We find an overall mean WTP of US$177 per year, with a confidence interval ranging from US$101 to US$587.”  If you average that out over regions — which, remember, have widely varying energy costs — it translates to about 14.4 percent more on energy bills. That’s a pretty good sized hit!  A carbon tax that big would generate about $22.3 billion a year in revenue — a little bit less than the CLC’s proposal, but in the same ballpark.  There are, of course, a million reasons to take these results with a grain of salt. First off, the idea that Americans know exactly how much they’re willing to pay, in advance, to the dollar, is a little fanciful. WTP on a survey is very different from WTP in the midst of a pitched political battle with partisans on different sides pushing sharply contrasting messages.  Secondly, public opinion does not generally determine US public policy anyway. Donors, organized interest groups, and larger political trends will determine the fate of carbon policy, not broad (and shallow) public opinion.  I’d say the most we could confidently learn from this kind of WTP survey is that Americans are not overtly horrified by the idea of paying a decent chunk of money to stop climate change. Given Americans’ generally tax-averse attitudes, that’s something!  What do Americans want to spend the revenue on? Clean energy.  Among some in climate circles — an odd coalition of conservatives, libertarians, and far lefties — there is an unshakeable faith that per-capita dividends are the skeleton key that will unlock public acceptance of carbon taxes. That’s why it is part of proposals from both the conservative-leaning CLC (see its paper on the “conservative case for carbon dividends”) and the grassroots Citizens’ Climate Lobby.  It seems like dividends ought to have political appeal. If every member of the public starts getting a yearly check, it makes sense that they’re going to want to keep getting those checks. And the bigger the carbon tax, the bigger the check, so it’s an insurance policy against backlash.  Unfortunately, the public steadfastly refuses to show any similar enthusiasm for the idea. (I reviewed some of the evidence in this post.) Americans are instinctively suspicious of dividends and generally support using the revenue for the same purpose as the tax, i.e., to transition off fossil fuels.  Sure enough, here’s what the Yale researchers found:  Per-capita dividends are down below 50 percent. Developing clean energy is at 80.  As I keep saying: clean energy is consistently popular, across political and demographic lines, like almost nothing else in political life these days. It is a political vein for smart politicians to mine, the current administration notwithstanding.  In fact, I suspect that public support for plans like CLC’s would be higher if they were presented first and foremost as bold, large-scale plans to transition to clean energy — with carbon taxes a secondary feature, a funding mechanism, not the highlight.  Economists love to price externalities. Fine, we get it. But the public does not think like economists; it does not see “taxing bads” as an inspiring policy initiative in and of itself. Trying to present a tax as a positive, proactive policy is a communications nightmare, flying directly in the face of decades of conservative anti-tax propaganda. It’s about the most difficult way you could imagine to get to climate policy.  Most people’s intuitions run the other way. If we want a certain kind of future, they reason, we should take active measures to achieve that future — spend the money, develop the tech, build the infrastructure. Not just tax the stuff we don’t like and hope for the best.  In this, most people are much wiser than economists.  But even if you don’t agree, carbon tax advocates have got to grapple seriously with the fact that the public does not share their enthusiasm for dividends, or for “revenue neutrality,” another shibboleth whose political appeal is vastly overestimated by wonks.  Those concepts might have some appeal in elite circles — which, realistically, have much more influence on policy than the public does — but they are highly unlikely to be the basis of any grand upswell of public support.  It’s just hard to build a movement around a negative. People want an inspiring, positive vision to reach for. Economics is the wrong place to look for that kind of thing.",11.0,11.0
1146,2725,10,29,2017,2017-10-29,Associated Press News,AP sources: DeVos may only partly forgive some student loans," In this Oct. 13, 2017 file photo, U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos speaks during a dinner hosted by the Washington Policy Center in Bellevue, Wash. The Associated Press has learned the Education Department is considering only partially forgiving federal loans for students defrauded by for-profit-colleges. That would mean abandoning the Obama administration’s policy of fully erasing that debt. Under President Barack Obama, tens of thousands of students deceived by now-defunct for-profit schools had over $550 million in such loans canceled completely. The possible change could leave many students scrambling after expecting full forgiveness. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — The Education Department is considering only partially forgiving federal loans for students defrauded by for-profit colleges, according to department officials, abandoning the Obama administration’s policy of erasing that debt.  Under President Barack Obama, tens of thousands of students deceived by now-defunct for-profit schools had over $550 million in such loans canceled.  But President Donald Trump’s education secretary, Betsy DeVos, is working on a plan that could grant such students just partial relief, according to department officials. The department may look at the average earnings of students in similar programs and schools to determine how much debt to wipe away.  The officials were not authorized to publicly comment on the issue and spoke on condition of anonymity.  If DeVos goes ahead, the change could leave many students scrambling after expecting full loan forgiveness, based on the previous administration’s track record. It was not immediately clear how many students might be affected.  A department spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday.  But the Trump team has given hints of a new approach.  In August, the department extended its contract with a staffing agency to speed up the processing of a backlog of loan forgiveness claims. In the procurement notice, the department said that “policy changes may necessitate certain claims already processed be revisited to assess other attributes.” The department would not further clarify the meaning of that notice.  DeVos’ review prompted an outcry from student loan advocates, who said the idea of giving defrauded students only partial loan relief was unjustified and unfair because many of their classmates had already gotten full loan cancellation. Critics say the Trump administration, which has ties to the for-profit sector, is looking out for industry interests.  Earlier this year, Trump paid $25 million to settle charges his Trump University misled students.  “Anything other than full cancellation is not a valid outcome,” said Eileen Connor, a litigator at Harvard University’s Project on Predatory Student Lending, which has represented hundreds of defrauded students of the now-shuttered Corinthian Colleges. “The nature of the wrong that was done to them, the harm is even bigger than the loans that they have.”  “Even more importantly, it is completely unfair that a happenstance of timing is going to mean that one student who’s been defrauded is going to have full cancellation and the next is not,” Connor said.  A federal regulation known as borrower defense allows students at for-profit colleges and other vocational programs to have their loans forgiven if it is determined that the students were defrauded by the schools. That rule dates to the early 1990s. But it was little used until the demise of Corinthian and ITT for-profit chains in recent years caused tens of thousands of students to request that the government cancel their loans.  In the last few months of the Obama administration, the Education Department updated the rule to add protections for students, shift more financial responsibility onto the schools and prevent schools from having students sign away their right to sue a school.  That change was set to take effect in July, but DeVos has frozen it and is working on a new version. She argued that the Obama regulation was too broad and could cancel the loans of some students without a sound basis.  DeVos has come under criticism for delaying consideration of over 65,000 applications for loan forgiveness under the borrower defense rule. The agency hasn’t approved a single claim since DeVos took office in February.  Jennifer Wang, an expert with the Institute of College Access and Success, said the Obama administration was providing full loan cancellations to students.  “It would be totally different from what was happening under the last administration,” Wang said. “It’s not equitable; it’s not fair for students. If she provides partial relief, it’s that she only cares what’s fair for schools and not students.”  Abby Shafroth, an attorney at the National Consumer Law Center, said the agency could be faced with lawsuits, especially from Corinthian students, whose classmates had received full forgiveness.",63.0,73.0

These “intelligent bandages” are made from cotton coated with an electrically conductive substance, then further surrounded by a gel capable of storing medications like antibiotics or painkillers. The individual fibers are controlled by a device no larger than a postage stamp affixed to the bandage, receiving signals from your mobile device. The bandage heals wounds three times as fast as normal.  Assistant Professor of Mechanical and Materials Engineering at Nebraska Ali Tamayol elaborated in a press release:  This is the first bandage that is capable of dose-dependent drug release. You can release multiple drugs with different release profiles. That’s a big advantage in comparison with other systems. What we did here was come up with a strategy for building a bandage from the bottom up.  Tamayol said that this technology “can be applied to many different areas of biomedical engineering and medicine,” which is good news for people suffering from long term or chronic wounds. Right now, there are an estimated 25 million Americans in need of just such a solution.  Perhaps even more notably, such treatment could be invaluable to soldiers in the field. According to Tamayol:  Soldiers on the battlefield may be suffering from a number of different injuries or infections. They might be dealing with a number of different pathogens. Imagine that you have a variable patch that has antidotes or drugs targeted toward specific hazards in the environment.  Tamayol and his associates are not the only ones advancing the science of wound care. Bandages with nanoscale sensors that transmit data to healthcare providers are in development, as well as heat-responsive bandages that heal faster.

Like what you’re reading? Sign up to get VoxCare in your inbox here.  President Trump signed an executive order that could — emphasis on could — do substantial damage to the Obamacare marketplaces.  Trump's order sets out two goals with major consequences for the insurance market, if they come to pass:  Make it easier to set up association health plans and for those plans to be considered part of the large-group market  Expand the definition of ""short-term limited-duration insurance"" from three months to nearly a year  If you want the full wonky breakdown, I wrote about the order and its potential effects on the Affordable Care Act here. But this is the gist: The White House wants to make it easier for people to buy cheaper and skimpier coverage that doesn't comply with the Affordable Care Act's rules.  vox-mark VoxCare Vox's email explaining the biggest news in health care, edited by Sarah Kliff Subscribe By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy. For more newsletters, check out our newsletters page  The risk, according to health policy experts, is that young and healthier people will flock to this skimpier coverage, making the Obamacare markets older and sicker. That is going to drive up premiums for people still buying coverage through the health care law.  But Trump's pen isn't magic. The executive order doesn't actually do anything on its own. Which is confusing! In fact, a lot about the executive order is hard to decipher.  Here are some of the big questions, and my best attempts to answer them.  1) When does this actually go into effect?  Trump has technically asked federal agencies to consider issuing new regulations that achieve the executive order's goals. That's all.  Federal rulemaking takes some time, months upon months. Senior administration officials told reporters today that they didn't expect any changes to be made before the end of the year.  2) Which Obamacare regulations are actually being targeted?  This answer comes in two buckets.  For association health plans: If they can be considered large-group plans, they no longer have to comply with Obamacare's requirement that they cover certain essential health benefits. Large employers are exempt from that rule, which is limited to individual and small-group plans.  For short-term insurance: These plans are completely free from the ACA's regulations. Carriers can deny people coverage based on their medical history, charge people higher premiums based on their health status, and limit their benefits significantly more than the health care law allows.  3) Can individuals buy into association health plans?  This is maybe the biggest question. Experts generally agree that if individuals are allowed to join the association plans, the impact on the Obamacare marketplaces will be much more severe.  The executive order itself seems to limit the plans to businesses. But administration officials, in their call with reporters, indicated that they will look at whether they can allow self-employed people to buy into these associations.  ""That is both a legal and policy question,"" one official said, adding it was ""potentially possible"" to allow those people to join associations.  4) Will this coverage be considered compliant with the individual mandate?  This is another issue with huge consequences. The one deterrent for people absconding to these skimpy plans, particularly the short-term insurance, is that they could still be subject to the individual mandate because the plan doesn't qualify as minimal coverage.  But if that changes, people would have even more incentive to abandon Obamacare and buy these skimpier plans, which would further damage the law's markets.  In the call with reporters, administration officials were coy. They simply noted that the executive order didn't address what is considered minimal coverage. They did point out that large-group coverage, which is what many association plans may soon be considered, is generally found to satisfy the mandate.  Any further changes to that threshold, particularly if the Trump administration makes short-term coverage compliant, would be a game changer.  5) What can states do?  We won't know until we see the regulations how much the traditional state authority to regulate association health plans and short-term insurance will be preempted. But experts are watching closely.  If states still have significant oversight, they could — if they so chose — potentially do a lot to limit people migrating to these skimpier plans.  But the Trump administration may try to write the new rules to handcuff states as much as possible.  6) Can these changes be challenged in court?  We simply won't know for sure until the administration proposes some actual regulations.  ""It’s just a set of marching orders,"" Nicholas Bagley, a law professor at the University of Michigan, said of the executive order.  ""We can speculate about what the agencies might do, and whether what they might do might be unlawful,"" he added. ""But it’s hard to handicap the odds of a challenge to something that hasn’t yet happened.""  Chart of the Day  Big deductibles for short-term insurance. Here is a stark reminder of how much less comprehensive short-term coverage is than what the ACA requires. These are out-of-pocket maximums for three months for short-term insurance in few different states. The full year out-of-pocket max for marketplace plans is $7,150 for an individual and $14,300 for a family. Read more here.

638,2037,10,15,2017,2017-10-15,Vox,Benching NFL players for protesting during the anthem would be illegal,"Last Sunday, Jerry Jones, the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, said he would bench players who did not stand during the national anthem. This threat was publicized nationally and applauded on Twitter by President Trump, who summarized the two men’s shared view: “Stand for Anthem or sit for game!”  On Wednesday, the president elaborated on his views, telling Fox News that the NFL “should have suspended” Colin Kaepernick for kneeling during the anthem because “you cannot disrespect our country, our flag, our anthem — you cannot do that.” It is quite possible the players have First Amendment protection against retaliation of this kind. The First Amendment generally protects citizens against the suppression of their speech by the government, not private entities like their employers. But when the president uses the power of his office to intimidate business owners into suppressing the speech of their employees — with both implied threats and specific ones — the possibility of a First Amendment violation becomes quite real.  Whatever the Constitution has to say about the matter, however, it is manifestly clear that Jones’s threat violates federal labor law. Benching, or otherwise disciplining, players who engage in anthem protests would be illegal.  The National Labor Relation Act forbids employers from taking adverse employment actions against workers who are engaged in “concerted activity for mutual aid or protection.”  So the first part of the labor law analysis, and the easiest, is whether “benching” counts as an adverse employment action of the sort the law prohibits. Some commentators have suggested that benching is not a sufficiently severe penalty to count (as they concede a heavy fine, or loss of job, might be). But anyone who has ever played sports, or watched sports, or had a kid who played sports, knows that benching is adverse. “Getting benched” is what happens to you when the coach wants to discipline or punish you. When your job is playing sports, getting benched is a pretty good definition of what adverse employment action means.  Employers can’t punish employees for “concerted activity for mutual aid”  The real issue in the anthem protest cases is whether the players’ actions constitute “concerted activity for mutual aid or protection,” which is what federal labor law protects. Again, the “concerted” prong is easy: There’s no question that the players involved are acting in concert with one another — i.e., together. The question is whether their anthem protests — which originated and remain directed in large part at questions of racial equality and justice, including the issue of police violence, as opposed to more traditional labor concerns, such as working conditions — are the kind of concerted activity that labor law shields against retaliation.  The fact that the protests are unmistakably “political” does not take them outside the scope of labor law. The Supreme Court, in Eastex v. NLRB, established — and the National Labor Relations Board has affirmed repeatedly — that labor law protects workers who engage in certain kinds of political advocacy. The limitation is that the political advocacy, to be protected by labor law, must relate to the employees’ status as employees. (Eastex involved Texas workers who, in a flyer promoting union solidarity, also called on workers to fight against a state “right to work” law and for minimum wage protections.)  And although, at first blush, the anthem protests may not seem to be about the players’ lives as players, there are several ways in which they most definitely are.  First, race discrimination — and certainly the acute kind that manifests as police violence — affects the targets of that discrimination across all spheres of their lives. Police violence directed at African-American men may happen away from the workplace, but that can’t mean that police violence has no impact on African-American men at work. Indeed, the idea that police violence, and other forms of race discrimination, can somehow be cabined away from work, just because that discrimination occurs away from work, is false. So when players protest societal discrimination against African-American men, this is a protest that concerns their lives as employees.  To be clear, labor law would not need to treat all types of off-work dynamics that potentially affect work as protected in order to treat the forms of race discrimination under protest here as protected. The law must draw lines of this sort all the time, and distinguishing things like racially discriminatory police violence from other forms of off-work behavior should be manageable.  Second, the NFL and the agreement the league has with the players stresses repeatedly that being an NFL player involves more than what happens on the field. For example, paragraph two of the standard player agreement states that a player must pledge to “conduct himself on and off the field with appropriate recognition of the fact that the success of professional football depends largely on public respect for and approval of those associated with the game.” In other words, the job of being a football player involves much more of what in many other occupations might be classified as non-work or non-employment matters. But the league can’t expand the definition of what it means to be an NFL player solely in order to restrict player conduct. Having defined the job as a public one, the league must then own the fact that players’ advocacy efforts around “public” issues — including race discrimination — concern the players as employees.  Protesting unfair punishment by bosses is core protected activity  Third, although all the protesters have solid protection from labor law for the reasons I’ve outlined, it would be even more blatantly illegal to bench anthem protesters in cases in which they are taking a knee as a means of showing support for teammates threatened with discipline for their actions — whether those threats come from a team owner or the president of the United States. For these protesters, taking a knee is a means of, among other things, expressing a view about what should and should not constitute a disciplinary offense at work. That kind of protest is the heartland of what labor law protects: It is absolutely core “concerted activity for mutual aid and protection.”  One final note. Even if anthem protests are protected by federal labor law, the players’ collective bargaining agreement could, in theory, waive their right to engage in them. The Supreme Court, however, has held that any such waiver has to be clear and unmistakable, and there is no such clear and unmistakable waiver in the players’ agreements that I’m aware of. Certainly, the language from paragraph two of the agreement — about conduct “on and off the field,” quoted above — doesn’t meet the standard.  Nor does language in paragraph 11 of the agreement, which allows a team to fire a player if the player “has engaged in personal conduct reasonably judged by Club to adversely affect or reflect on Club.” Again, it’s not specific enough.  There apparently also is a mention of the anthem in the “game operations manual” that suggests that players “should” stand during the anthem. It is unclear (at least to me) whether or how this manual is incorporated into the collective bargaining agreement. But the use of “should” rather than “must” makes it less than “clear and unmistakable” that the players’ rights in this respect have been waived.  The longer this goes on, the more evident it becomes that the players have a legal right to engage in the anthem protests. Labor law provides one such source of protection. Noah Zatz, a law professor at UCLA, has argued that Title VII, which forbids racial discrimination, provides another source.  Whatever the source of protection, however, the illegality of the threats issued by Jones and amplified by the president is clear.

Air pollution in India's capital has hit hazardous levels prompting local officials to ask that school shut down and a half marathon scheduled later in November be called off. (AP Photo/Manish Swarup)  NEW DELHI (AP) — A thick gray haze enveloped India’s capital on Tuesday as air pollution hit hazardous levels, prompting local officials to ask that schools shut down and a half marathon scheduled for later in November be called off.  The readings of the government’s air quality index hovered between 350 and 450, indicating that the health impact of breathing the air was “severe.” The highest reading on the Central Pollution Control Board’s index is 500. The pollutants on Tuesday that had the maximum impact on the reading were PM 2.5 and PM 10 particulate matter.  As winter approaches, a thick, soupy smog routinely envelops most parts of northern India, caused by dust, the burning of crops, emissions from factories and the burning of coal and piles of garbage as the poor try to keep warm.  Over the past two years, New Delhi has earned the dubious distinction of being one of the world’s most polluted cities.  On Tuesday, Belgium’s King Philippe and Queen Mathilde, in India on a weeklong state visit, inspected a military guard of honor at the sprawling presidential palace in New Delhi under a cover of smog that hampered visibility.  As the haze settled over the city in the morning, many people covered their faces and noses with scarves to try to protect themselves. Arvind Kejriwal, the capital’s top elected official, asked the education department to consider closing down schools.  The Indian Medical Association said New Delhi was in the midst of a “public health emergency” and appealed to the city government to halt sports and other outdoor activities in schools. The association also said the Delhi Half Marathon, scheduled for Nov. 19, was likely to leave those participating especially badly hit because the air quality is worst during the early part of the day, when the run takes place.  The sharp drop in air quality is most dangerous for the elderly, children and those already suffering from respiratory ailments. Constant exposure to pollution also reduces lung functionality for healthy adults over a period of time.  According to a recent report by the Lancet medical journal on the impact of pollution across the world, one out of every four premature deaths in India in 2015, or some 2.5 million, was attributed to pollution.  Delhi has struggled with putting in place pollution control measures over the last two years. It has tightened vehicle and factory emission norms and reduced the number of cars on the roads on the worst-hit days. But it’s had a hard time enforcing laws about crop burning, garbage fires and construction dust.  Kejriwal said on Twitter on Tuesday that his government had written to ministers in the neighboring states of Punjab and Haryana demanding an end to crop burning there, but that little had been done.  “All of us together have to find a (solution) to this,” he tweeted, adding that the city becomes a “gas chamber for almost a month” every year.",1.0,1.0

Like what you’re reading? Sign up to get VoxCare in your inbox here.  There is a popular narrative about the opioid epidemic now killing more than 30,000 Americans a year: People are put on prescription painkillers, maybe after they have an accident or a surgery, and then they get hooked. Sometimes they move on to heroin.  It's a story with some truth. In 2005, more than 80 percent of the people abusing opioids had started with pills, either oxycondone or hydrocodone. Less than 10 percent started with heroin.  vox-mark VoxCare Vox's email explaining the biggest news in health care, edited by Sarah Kliff Subscribe By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy. For more newsletters, check out our newsletters page  But that story is out of date. By 2015, according to research being published in Addictive Behaviors next month, more than 30 percent of opioid abusers were starting with heroin. Oxycodone and hydrocodone had fallen to 52 percent, combined.  Yet the public debate doesn't seem to have caught up with this change. The Senate health committee met Thursday to talk about the opioid crisis, and one attendee noted to me that for the first 30 minutes, the discussion had been focused exclusively on prescription drugs and how to curb their abuse.  ""Everyone’s afraid to say heroin,"" Andrew Kessler, who works on addiction issues at Slingshot Solutions, told me.  Addressing pill abuse, combating trends like the overprescribing of prescription opioids, remains important, of course, if half of opioid abusers are still getting started that way. But it's not sufficient.  The opioid crisis is still evolving, and our policies have to catch up. The news yesterday that Cigna would stop covering OxyContin (brand-name oxycodone) next year, directing patients instead to an abuse-deterrent alternative with which the insurer has a pricing agreement, caught my eye. That kind of step from payers, and any resulting effect on abuse, is worth monitoring.  But that will only help with the prescription painkillers. Heroin requires a different response.  ""Yeah, heroin is an opioid, but we don’t talk about heroin as much as we talk about pills,"" Kessler said. ""If they start with heroin, all the prescribing practices in the world are not going to help them.""  So how did this happen? The authors started their research with this hypothesis: As painkillers have become harder to get with a crackdown on prescribing, and as heroin became more available and therefore cheaper, more experienced users had made the transition from pills to heroin.  The researchers theorized that at the same time, this proliferation of heroin would have also led more novice drug users to start with heroin in the first place.  The findings suggest they were right, though we need more confirmation to be sure. I also recommend reading Sam Quinones's Dreamland for a deeper understanding of the intersection of painkiller and heroin abuse.  The point is: The ever-deadlier opioid crisis is still shifting beneath our feet. We need to recognize these changes and adapt our response — prevention, prevention, prevention is what advocates would recommend — accordingly.  ""We can’t play whack-a-mole with addiction — it’s complicated and involves multiple sectors, from health care to policing to schools, to come together to help individuals and families impacted by addiction,"" Jessica Nickel at the Addiction Policy Forum told me. ""There are genetic components, risk, and protective factors to consider, along with a very large number of innovations we can expand.""  Chart of the Day  MIPS! Remember MIPS, the best/worst new health care acronym. It's the major overhaul of Medicare physician payments that Congress set up back in 2015 to get rid of the hated ""doc fix.""

TWITTER UNCOVERS $274K IN AD SPENDING BY TO RUSSIAN OPERATIVES TIED TO 2016 ELECTION  In its blog post Thursday, Twitter said that it will be using RT’s ad spending (projected to be $1.9 million since 2011) for research around civic engagement and electoral misinformation.  RT slammed Twitter’s move. Allegations of election interference are “absolutely groundless and greatly-misleading,” according to Kirill Karnovich-Valua, RT’s Deputy Editor-in-Chief, in an article posted to RT’s website Thursday.  Karnovich-Valua says that, in 2016 negotiations, Twitter representatives pitched “a large-sum advertising proposal” to RT. The proposal, which was eventually declined by RT, involved promoting RT’s U.S. election coverage on Twitter, he added.  TWITTER ATTEMPTS TO INCREASE AD TRANSPARENCY AFTER RUSSIAN-BACKED SCANDAL  “RT has never been involved in any illegal activity online,” Karnovich-Valua wrote. “It never pursued an agenda of influencing the US election through any platforms, including Twitter.”  A Twitter spokeswoman told Fox News that the San Francisco-based firm does not have any comment on private conversations with advertisers, including former advertisers.  Sputnik’s Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan described Twitter’s decision as “regrettable” on Thursday. Simonyan is also the Editor-in-Chief of RT.

On Saturday, Oct. 7, 2017, Myers, who has been among the most vocal critics of President Donald Trump, tweeted that he'd ""love"" to have Trump on his NBC show, in response to one of his messages. (Photo by Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP, File)  President Donald Trump lashed out Saturday against late night television show hosts who have been sharply critical of his administration and Republicans.  Trump took to Twitter to argue that the GOP should be given “equal time” because of the “one-sided” coverage, an apparent reference to Federal Communications Commission rules dealing with political candidates during elections.  “Late Night host(s) are dealing with the Democrats for their very ‘unfunny’ & repetitive material, always anti-Trump!” he tweeted. “Should we get Equal Time?”  Trump also suggested “more and more people” are clamoring for more coverage of Republicans, who control the White House and Congress  Seth Meyers, who has been among the most vocal Trump critics, immediately tweeted back that he’d “love” to have Trump on his NBC show, and sarcastically provided his studio address as “15 Penguin Avenue, Antarctica.”  ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel, another critic, added : “Excellent point Mr. President! You should quit that boring job - I’ll let you have my show ALL to yourself #MAGA.”  And Comedy Central’s Daily Show responded by posting — “in the spirit of equal time”— Trump’s now infamous off-camera comments in 2005 to an “Access Hollywood” host in which he used coarse language to boast about groping women.  Others pointed out that “equal time” is meant for campaign season, not to protect elected officials from being the butt of television humor.  “That’s not how it works. You’re not campaigning. You’re the president,” Mike DiCenzo, a writer and producer for NBC’s “The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon,” tweeted . “Now kindly stop tweeting nonsense and go do your job for once.”  The FCC rule says political candidates should be treated equally by broadcast television stations when it comes to selling or giving away air time. Over the years, the commission has broadly exempted news programs, including late night talk shows, from the provision.  Trump’s tweets followed shortly after a segment on Fox News’ “Fox and Friends” critiquing many late show hosts for taking “a hard turn to the left.”  The president’s reference to “dealing with Democrats” appears to allude to recent reports that Kimmel consulted with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, before delivering a series of emotional and personal monologues against Republicans’ attempts to repeal and replace the health care law that was championed by former President Barack Obama.  Kimmel’s son, Billy, was born this year with a congenital heart defect, a pre-existing condition the late night host argued would have prevented the boy from getting health insurance if not for the Affordable Care Act that Obama signed in 2010.  Trump’s ire for his late night critics— who also include CBS’ Stephen Colbert and even Fallon at times — is not totally unfounded.  A study by researchers at George Mason University in Virginia found that Trump in on pace to “easily eclipse” the most jokes about any person tracked by its Center for Media and Public Affairs since it began monitoring in 1988.  The New York billionaire was the target of more than 1,000 jokes during his first 100 days in office, surpassing the 936 jokes made at Obama’s expense in his first year in office in 2009 and more than the 546 about George W. Bush in his first year as president in 2001, according to the study.  ___  This story has been corrected to fix a misspelling in Seth Meyers’ name.",17.0,13.0

As the Post and 60 Minutes explained in their bombshell report, the law effectively hindered the Drug Enforcement Administration’s (DEA) ability to prosecute opioid distributors and stop dangerous shipments of opioid painkillers — the kind of drugs that sparked America’s opioid epidemic — right as drug overdose deaths reached yet another peak in the US.  The measure was heavily backed by the drug industry, and Marino, who had received nearly $100,000 in donations from political action committees linked to the industry, was its main sponsor. The bill got through Congress with zero opposition before it was signed by President Barack Obama.  Marino, along with other key sponsors, Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), have rightfully gotten a bulk of the blame for the law in the aftermath.  But much of the outrage is missing the fact that it wasn’t just Marino, Blackburn, or Hatch but every single elected official at the federal level who deserves at least some of the blame for this law.  Marino, Blackburn, and Hatch were the major sponsors. But the law passed through what’s called unanimous consent — a procedure that’s used to pass uncontroversial bills in which no votes are recorded but members of the legislative body are given a chance to object. No one in Congress — not a Democrat or a Republican — spoke up.  And, of course, Obama signed the bill into law.  Everyone shares some of the blame  Based on my conversations with officials from Congress and the Obama administration this week, the measure slipped through without anyone giving it much thought. Once the DEA signed onto the law, everyone seemed to figure that it was fine. As one former administration official told me, who’s going to accuse the DEA, the face of America’s punitive war on drugs, of being “soft on crime” and hurting its own mission?  The Post’s headline says it all: “Did President Obama know bill would strip DEA of power?” Based on the report, the administration and much of Congress deferred to the DEA and otherwise knew little about the law’s impact. Michael Botticelli, Obama’s drug czar at the time, told the Post as much: “We deferred to DEA, as is common practice.”  But as the Post and 60 Minutes reported, the DEA only signed onto the law reluctantly after leadership changes at both the agency and Justice Department — and after it worked with Hatch on the bill’s language and figured that it got the best possible deal it could.  “DEA felt this wasn’t a great solution, but was the best of the options offered to us, even if it did not fully address the concerns we had previously laid out for you,” Jill Wade Tyson, a congressional liaison officer for the Justice Department, wrote in an email to Senate staff at the time, according to the Post.  As a Senate aide explained, DEA approval was perhaps the most critical point in the debate: If Congress is looking at a bill that affects a federal agency, the bill is going to be much less controversial if the agency approves of it. That the DEA was reluctant — and only came on board after leadership changes and heavy lobbying from the industry, including people like D. Linden Barber, a former DEA lawyer who now works for the drug distributor Cardinal Health — got lost in the process.  Still, there were other red flags. Ex–DEA officials — particularly Joe Rannazzisi, former head of the DEA’s Office of Diversion Control — continued warning lawmakers about the bill after the DEA gave it the okay. But as Rannazzisi told the Los Angeles Times after it passed, “They are taking the word of industry rather than the government’s expert in diversion control.”  So the law got through Congress and the White House without any objection.  Some senators have owned up to the bad process. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO), who’s spent much of the year investigating opioid companies, proposed a bill to repeal the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act shortly after the report by the Post and 60 Minutes. Her office was not directly involved in the original law’s passage. But she said in a statement, “All of us were in a position to catch this and none of us did — which is why I’m so motivated to repeal this law and ensure the DEA has every possible tool to crack down on bad actors.”  The law will make combating the opioid epidemic a bit harder  The end result is the federal government passed a law that stripped the DEA of its power to go after irresponsible opioid companies at the height of a drug overdose epidemic that these companies helped cause — an epidemic that now kills tens of thousands a year.  The law raised the burden of proof required for the DEA to freeze shipments of opioids it deems suspicious. DEA Chief Administrative Law Judge John Mulrooney described the effect in an upcoming law review article: “If it had been the intent of Congress to completely eliminate the DEA’s ability to ever impose an immediate suspension on distributors or manufacturers, it would be difficult to conceive of a more effective vehicle for achieving that goal.”  It also requires the DEA to give drug companies a chance to submit “corrective action” plans and take those plans into account before the agency can sanction them. Mulrooney wrote that this is akin to a law that requires police to “allow bank robbers to round up and return inkstained money and agree not to rob any more banks — all before any of those wrongdoers actually admit fault and without any consequence that might deter such behavior in the future.”  To understand why the DEA feels it needs these types of powers, consider another report from the Charleston Gazette-Mail in West Virginia: It found that from 2007 to 2012, drug firms poured a total of 780 million painkillers into the state — which had a total population of about 1.8 million. The small town of Kermit, West Virginia, had a population of 392, but a single pharmacy there received nearly 9 million hydrocodone pills over two years from out-of-state drug companies.  Critics of the drug industry have argued, convincingly, that opioid distributors should have known these kinds of shipments were not okay. Under federal law, the companies are supposed to report and stop suspicious orders of some drugs, including opioids. Yet they didn’t. And now West Virginia has the worst drug overdose death rate in the country.  Would the DEA have been able to reverse the opioid crisis without the new law? Almost certainly not. The agency acted far too slowly — only going after the industry after this all turned into a full-blown epidemic. And now so many people are suffering in this crisis that the response must focus on providing greater access to addiction treatment, not solely law enforcement action. (More on the solutions to the opioid crisis in Vox’s explainer.)  Based on the Post and 60 Minutes’ reports and Mulrooney’s law review article, though, the DEA would have been able to stop at least some dangerous shipments with the measure and maybe prevent some cases of misuse and addiction. But now the DEA can’t — all because every elected official in federal government, out of inattention, ignorance, or support from the drug industry, let this law go through.",23.0,31.0
1340,2939,11,2,2017,2017-11-02,Associated Press News,EPA to hold hearing on climate plan repeal in West Virginia," The Trump administration announced Thursday it will hold a public hearing in West Virginia on its plan to nullify an Obama-era plan to limit planet-warming carbon emissions. The state is economically dependent on coal mining.  The Environmental Protection Agency will take comments on its proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan in Charleston, the state capital, on Nov. 28 and 29.  “The EPA is headed to the heart of coal country to hear from those most impacted by the CPP and get their comments on the proposed repeal rule,” said EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. “The agency looks forward to hearing from all interested stakeholders.”  No other public hearings have yet been scheduled. EPA will also accept written comments about the proposed repeal through mid-January.  “We encourage stakeholders to participate, and submit comments online — including any requests for additional public meetings,” said Liz Bowman, an EPA spokeswoman. “As this is a vital issue that affects people across the country, we will do our best to respond to requests for additional meetings.”  Under the Obama administration, EPA held four multiday public hearings — in Washington, Atlanta, Pittsburgh and Denver — to collect feedback before issuing the Clean Power Plan in 2015. About two dozen conservative-leaning states and a battery of fossil-fuel companies immediately sued, successfully preventing the carbon reduction plan from taking effect prior to the election of Donald Trump, who as a candidate pledged to repeal it.  A Republican lawyer who previously served as the attorney general of Oklahoma, Pruitt was among those who fought the Clean Power Plan in court. Since his appointment by Trump to lead EPA, he has made the delay and reversal of recent environmental regulations negatively impacting the profits of coal and petrochemical companies a priority.  Though Trump, Pruitt and others have blamed environmental regulations for the loss of coal-mining jobs, many industry insiders concede that it has been the accelerating shift of electric utilities using cheaper and cleaner-burning natural gas that is the primary culprit.  Pruitt has also sought to cast doubt on the consensus of climate scientists that the continued burning of fossil fuels is the main driver of global warming. Scientists say climate change has already triggered rising seas and more extreme weather, including killer heat waves, worsened droughts and torrential rains.  A Government Accountability Office report released earlier this month concluded that the impacts from climate change are already costing the federal government money, and those costs will likely increase over time.  U.S. taxpayers spent more than $350 billion over the last decade on disaster assistance programs and insurance payouts from floods and crop failures. That tally does not include the massive toll from this year’s wildfires and three major hurricanes, expected to be among the most costly in the nation’s history.  The report predicts these costs will only grow in the future, averaging a budget busting $35 billion each year by 2050 — a figure that recent history would suggest is a conservative estimate.  Bill Price, an organizer for the Sierra Club based in West Virginia, worried that by holding the public hearing where support for both Trump and coal are the strongest, the administration hoped that those opposed to that agenda might be more reticent to speak out.  “There is a concern that the scheduled hearing in West Virginia has all the markings of a sham, that only gives a dying industry a venue to intimidate people,” Price said. “It is our hope that the hearing will provide a safe place where all viewpoints can be heard.”  ___  Register to comment on the EPA’s proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan:  https://www.epa.gov/stationary-sources-air-pollution/electric-utility-generating-units-repealing-clean-power-plan  ___  Follow Associated Press environmental writer Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck",53.0,62.0

President Donald Trump struck a deal with Democratic congressional leaders House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) on September 6 to increase the debt limit and fund the government for three months, according to The New York Times. The Times noted that by accepting the Democrats' offer, Trump “blindsid[ed] his own Republican allies” and “signaled that he was willing to cross party lines to score some much-desired legislative victories.” From the September 6 Times article:  President Trump struck a deal with Democratic congressional leaders on Wednesday to increase the debt limit and finance the government until mid-December, blindsiding his own Republican allies as he reached across the aisle to resolve a major dispute for the first time since taking office. The agreement would avert a fiscal showdown later this month without the bloody, partisan battle that many had anticipated by combining a debt ceiling increase and stopgap spending measure with relief aid to Texas and other areas devastated by Hurricane Harvey. But without addressing the fundamental underlying issues, it set up the prospect for an even bigger clash at the end of the year. In embracing the three-month deal, Mr. Trump accepted a Democratic proposal that had been rejected earlier in the day by Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin. Mr. Trump’s snap decision at a White House meeting caught Republican leaders off guard and reflected friction between the president and his party. After weeks of criticizing Republican leaders for failing to pass legislation, Mr. Trump signaled that he was willing to cross party lines to score some much-desired legislative victories. [The New York Times, 9/6/17]  Reporters and pundits declare Trump ""independent"" after short term debt ceiling agreement  Fox News’ Mo Elleithee: Trump is “not a partisan or an ideologically driven kind of guy.” Fox News contributor Mo Elleithee claimed that no one “should be all that surprised by,” Trump’s decision “to cut a deal with the Democrats,"" because Trump “proved during the campaign that he was not a partisan or an ideologically driven kind of guy.” From the September 10 edition of Fox Broadcasting Co.’s Fox News Sunday:  CHRIS WALLACE (HOST): Mo, extending the debt limit and funding for just three months, how much leverage does that give Pelosi and Schumer? MO ELLEITHEE: Look, I think Brit [Hume] was right in that the president has just lost a lot of leverage moving forward, and the Republican Party has just lost a lot of leverage moving forward. I don't think anyone should be all that surprised by what the president did for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is he proved during the campaign that he was not a partisan or an ideologically driven kind of guy. He was the kind of guy who was going to kind of look out for himself first, and here he was with the ability to cut a deal with the Democrats that would be completely antithetical to what his own party would want. And, frankly, antithetical to what he himself in the past had said. Right, it just wasn't that long ago that he was out there tweeting, attacking Republicans in Congress when they did a four-month deal to extend the debt ceiling difference, saying he was a terrible negotiator. [Fox Broadcasting Co., Fox News Sunday, 9/10/17]  Fox News’ Bret Baier: The president is “not dogmatic. He's not ideological. ... He is about the win.” Fox News anchor Bret Baier remarked that people should “not be surprised,” by Trump’s concessions to Democratic leaders because the president is “not dogmatic” or “ideological,” but rather, “he is about the win.” From the September 8 edition of Fox News’ America’s News Headquarters:  HARRIS FAULKNER (HOST): Are the Democrats more reliable than the people in your own political party for the president? BRET BAIER: Listen, the president clearly has expressed himself on Twitter and in interviews and speeches saying that he's frustrated with the GOP leadership, with the GOP establishment. And that he’s -- and he suggested in the Cabinet Room yesterday that he's ready to change the dynamic, to shake things up. People should not be surprised about this. We've had a day and a half of kind of absorbing what happened in the Oval Office with the GOP and Democratic leadership. But he talked about this in his inauguration speech, that what matters is not what party controls government, but that the government is controlled by the people. He's not dogmatic. He's not ideological. He is about the W. He is about the win. And sometimes, day-to-day, it depends on which team you're going to turn to. [Fox News, America’s News Headquarters, 9/8/17]  CNN’s David Gregory: Trump is “not an ideological president.” CNN political analyst David Gregory argued that “there's always been the promise that Donald Trump … would buck his own party,” adding that Trump’s deal with Democrats in Congress is “evidence” that, “He’s not an ideological person, he’s not an ideological president.” From the September 8 edition of CNN’s New Day:  ALISYN CAMEROTA (CO-HOST): OK David, let's talk about this somewhat surreal new bond, newfound friendship between Donald Trump and Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. I mean, their names to Donald Trump's base, Schumer and Pelosi, are like synonymous with the bogeyman. But Donald Trump seems to be -- I mean, The New York Times this morning is reporting how much he's enjoying the media coverage, saying he's forging this new sort of bipartisan spirit. It's impossible, obviously, to ever predict what President Trump will do. But this is shaking things up in Washington in an interesting way. DAVID GREGORY: Look, I think there's always been the promise that Donald Trump is so unpredictable that he would buck his own party, that he would make things uncomfortable for Democrats, he would make things comfortable for them, he'd work with them. He's not an ideological person, he’s not an ideological president. We're seeing some of the evidence of that. [CNN, New Day With Chris Cuomo and Alisyn Camerota, 9/8/17]  NY Times: Trump’s is “in many ways, the first independent to hold the presidency since the advent of the current two-party system.” The New York Times suggested that Trump is “in many ways, the first independent to hold the presidency since the advent of the current two-party system around the time of the Civil War.” The Times also wrote that Trump “abandoned Republican congressional leaders,” and showed that he “does not feel beholden to his party” by making a deal with Democrats. From the September 9 article:  Now in the White House, President Trump demonstrated this past week that he still imagines himself a solitary cowboy as he abandoned Republican congressional leaders to forge a short-term fiscal deal with Democrats. Although elected as a Republican last year, Mr. Trump has shown in the nearly eight months in office that he is, in many ways, the first independent to hold the presidency since the advent of the current two-party system around the time of the Civil War. [...] While some conservatives complained about the apostasy of cutting deals with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, others applauded his assault on establishment Republican leaders like Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. By the week’s end, pundits speculated about whether Mr. Trump might seek re-election in 2020 as an independent. [...] But it showed that Mr. Trump does not feel beholden to his party. “I never viewed Trump as a strict adherent to Republicanism,” said Ned Ryun, a Trump supporter and founder of American Majority, which trains political activists. “He gave Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell almost nine months to get something accomplished, and all they accomplished was to really remove all doubts about their legislative incompetence.” [The New York Times, 9/9/17]  AP: Trump “now appears unbound by ideology and untethered by party allegiances.” The Associated Press alleged that Trump’s deal with Democrats displayed that he is “unbound by ideology and untethered by party allegiances.” From the September 10 article:  A president who spent months catering to the Republican conservative wing now appears unbound by ideology and untethered by party allegiances. It’s not a complete surprise to his fellow Republicans. They long have worried that Trump, a former Democrat, might shift with the political winds. But Trump’s overtures to Democrats have left Republicans in an awkward and perplexing position, undercut by their leader and unsure of what’s next. [The Associated Press, 9/10/17]  Daily Caller contributor Brian Joondeph: “Trump is not a partisan ideologue. ... he is a deal maker.” Daily Caller contributor Brian Joondeph asserted that Trump’s deal with Democrats in Congress is evidence that the president “is not a partisan ideologue,” but rather “he is a deal maker and wants to get stuff done.” From the September 8 piece:  Trump is not a partisan ideologue. Once a Democrat, he is now a Republican. His beliefs and agenda are far more aligned with Republicans than Democrats but ultimately, he is a deal maker and wants to get stuff done. Executive orders have their limits. Legislation is the only lasting solution. The GOP Congress is not delivering and Trump has had enough. The GOP chooses to snooze. And as Mitch and Paul recently learned, they will lose. Along with the Republican Party. [The Daily Caller, 9/8/17]  Wash. Post’s Robert Costa: “In spirit, Pres. Trump isn't a Democrat or a Republican. He's a freewheeling, transactional pol who looks for wins.”  In spirit, Pres. Trump isn't a Democrat or a Republican. He's a freewheeling, transactional pol who looks for wins. https://t.co/HAEfKyXJDT — Robert Costa (@costareports) September 9, 2017  [Twitter, 9/9/17]  In reality, Trump is governing like a ""conventional Republican president""  NY magazine's Jonathan Chait: Trump ""has governed almost exclusively as an orthodox movement conservative."" New York magazine's Jonathan Chait wrote that while Trump ""undermined his own party"" in the debt ceiling negotiations, Trump ""has governed almost exclusively as an orthodox movement conservative."" From the September 7 article:  Yesterday, an impatient and irritable President Trump undermined his own party’s negotiations and agreed to to a debt-ceiling increase on a timetable proposed by Democrats. At that point, all hell broke loose. The far-right wing of the Republican Party irrationally blamed Paul Ryan for the debacle. But just as irrational has been the response of the Republican Establishment, which has likewise used the deal as a pretext to unleash pent-up recriminations. [...] What made the debt-ceiling compromise so noteworthy is that it represents the first time Trump bargained with the opposing party in any meaningful way. He has governed almost exclusively as an orthodox movement conservative. Trump has done nothing on trade, has abandoned his plan to spend a trillion dollars on infrastructure, has thrown his support behind any repeal or rollback of Obamacare that Congress could pass (which turns out to be nothing), is trying to pass the largest regressive tax cut possible, and has diligently slashed regulations on business. [...] From the perspective of these conservatives, Trump’s fealty to right-wing orthodoxy was decidedly inconvenient. The debt ceiling presented a rare opportunity for them to present Trump as the figure they cast him as all along: the New York Democrat posing as a conservative Republican. The fact that they had to wait seven and a half months to find an example of his ideological heresy — and that the case they found was the picayune issue of a three-month debt-ceiling increase versus a six-month debt-ceiling increase — itself disproves their point. [New York, 9/7/17]  Political science professor Richard Skinner: ""Donald Trump increasingly seems to be governing like a conventional Republican president—albeit one who is showing signs of incompetence."" In a post for Brookings, political science professor Richard Skinner explained that Trump ""seems to be governing like a conventional Republican president--albeit one who is showing signs of incompetence and contempt for governing norms,"" adding that Trump has ""largely prioritized the most traditionally Republican items on his agenda.""

950,2455,10,23,2017,2017-10-23,Vox,Trump’s latest big interview is both funny and terrifying,"It’s not exactly a news flash at this point that Donald Trump isn’t very fluent on questions of public policy, but his interview over the weekend with Fox Business Channel’s Maria Bartiromo is really a sobering reminder of the levels of ignorance and dishonesty that the country is dealing with.  Bartiromo is an extraordinarily soft interviewer who doesn’t ask Trump any difficult questions or press him on any subject. That makes the extent to which he manages to flub the interview all the more striking. He’s simply incapable of discussing any topic at any length in anything remotely resembling an informed or coherent way. He says the Federal Reserve is “important psychotically” and it’s part of one of his better answers, since one can at least tell that he meant to say “psychologically.”  By contrast, it’s often hard to make any sense at all of Trump’s words. Asked whether he plans to tie an infrastructure plan to his tax plan, Trump says, “I was thinking about tying it, but there’s too many honestly.” Too many what? He then continues: “You lose a few votes, you gain a few votes. I don’t want to take any chances ’cause I feel we have the votes right now the way it is.” There is, of course, no tax bill at the moment, so there’s no way Trump has the votes for it.  It’s a funny interview in many ways. Along with being comically ignorant, Trump for some reason keeps referring to Chief of Staff John Kelly as “elegant.” But the prospect of a president of the United States who’s incapable of talking about any of the many issues he oversees in a reasonable way is also pretty scary.  Trump doesn’t know anything about any issue  As a table setter, here is Trump attempting to tout a report by his own Council of Economic Advisers arguing that cutting the corporate tax rate to 20 percent will raise the average American household’s wages by $4,000:  And I think that there’s tremendous appetite. There’s tremendous spirit for it, not only by the people we’re dealing with in Congress but for the people out there that want to see something — $5,000, almost. It can be $5,000 average per individual — per group. And so I’m really looking forward to it. Let’s see what happens.  Of course $4,000 and $5,000 are different amounts of money, as you will swiftly learn if you attempt to give someone $4,000 to discharge a $5,000 debt. And individuals aren’t households. Trump seems to have kinda sorta caught himself on this one and corrected himself from “per individual” to “per group.” But of course there are all kinds of groups.  That is Trump’s grasp of his administration’s analysis of his own No. 1 policy priority — he can’t remember either the amount of money involved or the unit of analysis. A bit later, Trump shows a similar grasp of detail in describing his view of the bipartisan health care legislation from Sens. Patty Murray (D-WA) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN):  Well, I’ve — I have looked at it very, very strongly. And pretty much, we can do almost what they’re getting. I — I think he is a tremendous person. I don’t know Sen. Murray. I hear very, very good things. I know that Lamar Alexander’s a fine man, and he is really in there to do good for the people. We can do pretty much what we have to do without, you know, the secretary has tremendous leeway in the — under the Obama plans. One of the things that they did, because they were so messed up, they had no choice but to give the secretary leeway because they knew he’d have to be — he or she would have to be changing all the time. And we can pretty much do whatever we have to do just the way it is. So this was going to be temporary, prior to repeal and replace. We’re going to repeal and replace Obamacare.  Trump has no information about, interest in, or knowledge of the substance of the bill. Instead, he judges it entirely on the basis of his personal impressions of the legislators involved. Except while he vouches that Alexander is “a fine man,” he hasn’t bothered to get to know Murray at all, even though she’s the top Democrat on the committee with jurisdiction over health care and health care was his main legislative initiative for the first nine months of his administration.  Bartiromo keeps ineptly trying to cover for Trump  Another signature quality of the interview is that since Trump is actually totally incapable of answering softball questions, Bartiromo has to try to lead him by the nose to delivering on-message propaganda. Trump, however, is not that cooperative with this agenda.  Cutting taxes on the rich, for example, is unpopular. So the White House’s plan to get tax cuts on the rich passed is to lie about it and pretend they’re actually proposing a big middle-class tax cut. Bartiromo tries to get Trump to say that, but he keeps getting distracted by his desire to tell a name-dropping story about the owner of the New England Patriots:  BARTIROMO: If the top earners pay 80 percent of the taxes, why are you so afraid to cut taxes on the top earners? TRUMP: I think this, look, you know, I am very happy with the way I’ve done part of this in my civilian life, all right. BARTIROMO: Of course. This is not about — TRUMP: Other people — well, it’s about me representing rich people. BARTIROMO: Okay. TRUMP: Representing — being representative of rich people. Very interesting to me Bob Kraft was down. He was very nice. He owns the Patriots. He gave me a Super Bowl ring a month ago. And he — BARTIROMO: Well, Putin took his — TRUMP: Which was very nice. That’s right. But he left this beautiful ring, and I immediately give it to the White House and they put it some place, and that’s the way it is. BARTIROMO: That’s great. TRUMP: He said to me — he’s a good man. He said to me you have to do us all a favor, give the tax decrease to the middle class, we don’t need it. We don’t need it. We don’t want it. Give it to the middle class. And, I’ve had many people, very wealthy people, tell me the very same thing. I’ve had very few say I want more, I want more.  Then Trump meanders off message and admits that what he’s really backing is a huge tax cut for rich business owners:  TRUMP: So that’s a big factor, but we have so many things that are going to be so great; bringing the corporate tax down maybe is the most important. And we have a lot of most important, but bringing it down from 35 down to 20 percent, that’s a massive — that’s the biggest that we’ve ever done. BARTIROMO: It’s a big deal in the corporate rate for sure. TRUMP: That’s a big deal for companies; that’s a big deal for investment. I think one of the other ones is expensing, you know when you write something off in one year as opposed to, you know, over many years, I think that’s going to be tremendous.  Trump undermines his own “tough on Iran” policies  In a really striking moment, Trump seems to repudiate his own policy toward Iran, disavowing any interest in getting foreign countries to crack down on trade with a country that he’s accused of all manner of misdeeds:  BARTIROMO: Do you think they're going to get Europeans to support you in terms of sanctions, in terms of not selling technology to Iran? TRUMP: Honestly, I told them. They're friends of mine. They really are. I get along with all of them. Whether it's Emmanuel [Macron] or whether it’s Angela [Merkel], I get along — I really like those people. I told them, just keep making money. Don’t worry about it. We don’t need you on this. You just keep making money. When Iran buys things from Germany and from France and from the various — by billions of dollars, even us, they were going to buy Boeings. I don’t know what's going to happen with the deal. We'll see what happens with the deal, but — but when they buy those things, it's a little harder for those countries to do something. Would they do it if I really was insistent? I believe they would. I told them just keep making money. Don’t worry. We don’t need you on this one.  The reality is that precisely because the United States has been sanctioning Iran since the embassy crisis in 1980, the vast majority of the incremental leverage that was applied to the Iranians over their nuclear weapons program came from sanctions imposed by European and other foreign nations. It’s unlikely that the US could persuade those countries to go back to their pre-deal sanctions just because Trump has decided he doesn’t like the multilateral deal. But if you disavow any intention of getting Europeans to sanction Iran, there’s absolutely no point to the whole exercise.  And of course it’s no surprise that Trump can’t get any of his policy analysis right, since he keeps misstating very basic facts.  Trump gets all kinds of facts wrong  Sometimes Trump’s factual errors are just a little bit of puffery.  Bartiromo says, “You see the job creation, as well this year,” to which Trump replies, “It’s been fantastic.” In reality, job creation this year — while okay — has been somewhat slower than job creation in 2016 or 2015.  He also gets numbers wrong, like when he says, “If we pick up one point on GDP that’s $2.5 trillion if you think of.” The right number would be $185 billion, so Trump missed the mark by a couple of trillion bucks — which is a lot of money even for a rich guy.  Trump also brags of last quarter’s 3.2 percent GDP growth that “we haven’t been there in a long time; it’s been a long time.” In fact, we had a stronger growth quarters in Q1 of 2015, Q3 of 2014, Q2 of 2014, Q4 of 2013, and Q3 of 2013. There’s nothing particularly unusual about it, in other words.  Trump, however, compounds his vague misstatement with some extra detail, saying, “As you know, the previous administration didn’t hit it for the year for eight years,” which isn’t remotely true, before reiterating, “In eight years it didn’t hit it at all.”  He says the trade deficit with Mexico is “almost $70 billion a year” when the right number is $55 billion, and that “there is hardly a country” with which the United States runs a trade surplus. “I can name two,” Trump concedes. The Census Bureau, however, has a full top 10 list, starting with Hong Kong, the Netherlands, and Belgium but also featuring Australia, Brazil, Egypt, and the United Kingdom.  Trump claims to “have made more progress against ISIS in the last nine months than in the last eight years,” when ISIS is only about four or five years old.  This is how we live now  Over the course of the interview, Trump also claims to be working on a major infrastructure bill, a major welfare reform bill, and an unspecified economic development bill of some kind.  Under almost any other past president, that kind of thing would be considered a huge news-making get for an interviewer. But even Fox didn’t tout Bartiromo’s big scoops on Trump’s legislative agenda, because 10 months into the Trump presidency, nobody is so foolish as to believe that him saying, “We’re doing a big infrastructure bill,” means that the Trump administration is, in fact, doing a big infrastructure bill. The president just mouths off at turns ignorantly and dishonestly, and nobody pays much attention to it unless he says something unusually inflammatory.  On some level, it’s a little bit funny. On another level, Puerto Rico is still languishing in the dark without power (and in many cases without safe drinking water) with no end in sight. Trump is less popular at this point in his administration than any previous president despite a generally benign economic climate, and shows no sign of changing course.  Perhaps it will all work out for the best, and someday we’ll look back and chuckle about the time when we had a president who didn’t know anything about anything that was happening and could never be counted on to make coherent, factual statements on any subject. But traditionally, we haven’t elected presidents like that — for what have always seemed like pretty good reasons — and the risks of compounding disaster are still very much out there.",16.0,27.0

There is a cable from the Central Intelligence Agency to its officers in Santiago after a failed operation in October 1970 to prevent Allende from assuming office, which he did that November. The C.I.A. provided weapons for the plan, which resulted in the killing of the commander in chief of the army, Gen. René Schneider, and the agency later sent money to help some of the plotters flee the country.  “The station has done an excellent job of guiding Chileans to a point today where a military solution is at least an option for them,” the cable says, commending the officers, even though their plot was foiled.  The exhibition includes only a small sample of the 23,000 documents on Chile that the Clinton administration declassified between 1999 and 2000 in response to international requests for evidence on Pinochet’s crimes. The former Chilean dictator was arrested in London in October 1998 and awaited extradition to Spain to face trial on charges of human rights abuses during his rule.  As several other European countries also sought Pinochet’s extradition based on the principle of universal jurisdiction, Mr. Kornbluh, the curator, led a campaign to persuade the White House to release classified records that could serve in an eventual trial against the general.  Documents on Chile from 1968 to 1991 from seven United States government agencies, some of them heavily redacted, were released as part of the State Department’s Chile Declassification Project. Most were declassified months after Pinochet was sent home from London for humanitarian reasons, but just in time to contribute to new judicial investigations in Chile.",1.0,7.0

The National Rifle Association joined the Trump administration and top congressional Republicans in a surprising joint embrace of a gun control measure, albeit a narrow one: to regulate “bump stocks,” legal devices the Las Vegas shooter apparently used to effectively automate his weapons _ to lethal effect. Ryan added his support, too, as have other top Republicans. “Obviously we need to look at how we can tighten up the compliance with this law so that fully automatic weapons are banned,” the Wisconsin Republican told reporters at an event in Chestertown, Md. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)  WASHINGTON (AP) — The National Rifle Association joined the Trump administration and top congressional Republicans Thursday in a swift and surprising embrace of a restriction on Americans’ guns, though a narrow one: to regulate the “bump stock” devices the Las Vegas shooter apparently used to horrifically lethal effect.  The devices, originally intended to help people with disabilities, fit over the stock and grip of a semi-automatic rifle and allow the weapon to fire continuously, some 400 to 800 rounds in a single minute. Bump stocks were found among the gunman’s weapons and explain why victims in Las Vegas heard what sounded like automatic-weapons fire as the shooter rained bullets from a casino high-rise, slaughtering 58 people in a concert below and wounding hundreds more.  Thursday’s sudden endorsements of controls came almost simultaneously from the NRA and the White House.  The NRA, which famously opposes virtually any hint of new restrictions, said in a statement: “The National Rifle Association is calling on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) to immediately review whether these devices comply with federal law. The NRA believes that devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations.”  Congressman John Lewis joined fellow Democratic representatives outside the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday to call for action on gun legislation. He indicated Republicans were not focusing on the issue at hand after the deadly Las Vegas shooting. (Oct. 4)  Moments after, at the White House, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders praised the announcement.  “We welcome that and a conversation on that,” Sanders said. “It’s something we’re very open to.”  House Speaker Paul Ryan added his support, as have other top Republicans.  “Obviously we need to look at how we can tighten up the compliance with this law so that fully automatic weapons are banned,” the Wisconsin Republican told reporters at an event in Chestertown, Maryland.  It was a rare concession for all concerned. The nation’s largest gun lobby and most Republicans have stood firmly in recent years against stricter gun regulations, even as one mass shooting after another horrified the nation. They blocked background check legislation after the shooting deaths of elementary school children in Connecticut in 2012, and took no action despite intense pressure from Democrats, including a House floor sit-in, after last year’s bloodbath at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Even gunfire that left House Majority Whip Steve Scalise near death at a baseball practice earlier this year didn’t change the equation.  But this time, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, combined with the opportunity to back a limited change that could potentially be accomplished administratively, spurred a shift.  Robert Spitzer, chairman of the political science department at SUNY Cortland, who watches the gun industry closely, said he was surprised.  Still, he said, “it’s a pretty small concession in the realm of gun stuff. We’re not talking about banning assault weapons here. It’s a very specific accessory.”  The device, which retails for around $200, is not known among gun dealers as an item that is hugely popular. It was created ostensibly to help people with disabilities more easily fire AK- and AR-platform long guns.  The device causes the gun to buck back and forth, repeatedly “bumping” the trigger against the shooter’s finger. Technically, that means the finger is pulling the trigger for each round fired, keeping the weapon a legal semi-automatic. Because it creates a significant rocking motion it also means that the gun is “spraying” bullets and it’s difficult to hit a target.  The stocks have been around for less than a decade. Many Capitol Hill Republicans said this week they had never even heard of them before the shooting in Las Vegas. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms during the Obama administration gave its seal of approval to their sale in 2010 after concluding that they did not violate federal law.  Now, some Republicans appear inclined to blame the Obama administration for allowing their use in the first place.  “We have to get more education on what they are,” Ryan said. “Was it a regulatory misstep by ATF some years ago?”  The issue of bump stocks came up aboard Air Force One as President Donald Trump traveled back from visiting Las Vegas on Wednesday, according to GOP Rep. Mark Amodei of Nevada, who was on board and said Trump sounded open to a change.  But Democrats insisted that a regulatory change by the ATF would not be sufficient.  “Federal regulations won’t be able to fully close this loophole,” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, who introduced a bill this week to ban the devices. “Legislation would make crystal clear that Congress is banning all devices that allow a weapon to achieve an automatic rate of fire, regardless of how a weapon is altered.”  It was uncertain whether Congress would go that far.  At the same time, the attention on the devices was already causing an industry response. Slide Fire, the leading maker of bump stocks, suspended sales of the items. In a post on its website, the company said it was not taking any new orders “to provide the best service with those already placed.”  ___  Associated Press writer Lisa Marie Pane contributed from Atlanta.",1.0,4.0
1177,2765,10,27,2017,2017-10-27,Vox,Congress is a breeding ground for harassment,"As more and more women go public with allegations of sexual harassment against public figures, Congress is coming under scrutiny.  Conversations with congressional aides in the wake of the revelations about Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein all indicate a not-so-surprising reality on Capitol Hill: Everyone has heard of someone who has gone through hell in the workplace — from sexual assault to office abuses.  But in this major power center, workplace harassment isn’t a conversation congressional offices have until it absolutely needs to be had — whether because of a bombshell news report or a victim’s push for internal review.  While national media homed in on the details of the Weinstein case in mid-October, a pro-life Republican, Pennsylvania Rep. Tim Murphy, resigned after news broke that he had pressured his mistress to have an abortion. The scandal unveiled a history of harassment in Murphy’s office, including an abusive chief of staff who established a toxic work environment of mental abuse and strong-arm leadership.  Reports from Politico and Washington Post indicate the problem is much more pervasive. These accounts detail that Congress didn’t develop a reporting system for harassment until 1995, after Republican Sen. Bob Packwood resigned in disgrace over harassment claims. Since then, it’s become clear there’s more work to be done.  “It is not a victim-friendly process. It is an institution-protection process,” Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA), told the Washington Post. “I think we would find that sexual harassment is rampant in the institution. But no one wants to know, because they’d have to do something about it.”  All too often, these stories bubble up in Washington: The high-stakes, high-pressure environment and striking power imbalance between low-paid employees and the nation’s politicians allow for unfettered corruption and misconduct.  Congress is a breeding ground for harassment  There are certain factors that lead to higher levels of workplace harassment:  In male-dominated environments, women experience high levels of harassment.  Workplaces that revolve around the approval of a powerful figure of authority create a risk for harassment.  Those in low-wage positions experience high levels of harassment because they do not have bargaining power to push back.  Congress checks those boxes.  “Wherever there are big power disparities with people working closely together, that is a risk factor for work place harassment,” Emily Martin, general counsel and vice president of workplace justice at the National Women’s Law Center, said. “When you have a congressman working with a woman who is in her first job after college, that is a dynamic that can risk work place harassment.”  Working relationships are currency on Capitol Hill, where the future of people’s careers hinges on supporting a person in power. Staff positions are low-paid and have high turnover — and moving jobs often requires having a good reputation.  For those experiencing harassment, there’s a constant fear of tarnishing that reputation. And it’s a well-founded concern — a 2015 analysis of complaints to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission shows 75 percent of women who report harassment experience retaliation, a real fear on Capitol Hill.  “I was in the position of having no choice but reacting in a way that was going to make a big deal out of it in front his staff or his wife, or acting like nothing was happening. I chose the latter,” Ally Coll Steele, a former Democratic senator’s intern, told the Washington Post, about the senator grabbing her buttocks at the 2004 Democratic National Convention.  Time and time again, these stories come to the surface. In 2015, Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-TX) settled a sexual harassment case with his former communications director Lauren Greene, after a series of inappropriate comments. Farenthold still holds office. In 2011, Rep. John Ensign (R-NV) resigned after acknowledging having an affair with a staffer. In 2010, Rep. Eric Massa (D-NY) resigned after allegations that he had groped a male staffer. In 2014, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) shared personal accounts of sexual harassment from her Senate colleagues. The list goes on.  For many staffers, the best solution is often to change offices, a practice that can allow a serial offender to affect more individuals. There’s no question that most cases in Congress are going unreported.  Solutions are few and far between. In 2014, Speier introduced legislation that would mandate members and staff undergo harassment training — which is mostly effective in helping people identify harassing behavior not necessarily preventing it. Currently, no one in the Capitol is required to undergo harassment training. Now Speier is planning to introduce legislation to revamp Congress’s oversight entity, and is encouraging people to come forward with their own stories.  “The chief of staff held my face kissed me and stuck his tongue in my mouth,” Speier said in a video campaign calling on congressional staffers and members to share their experiences of harassment. “I know what it’s like to keep these things hidden deep down inside. … Congress has been a breeding ground for a hostile work environment for far too long.”  There’s a system for oversight in Congress. It’s not accessible.  What transpired in Murphy’s office was an apparent breakdown of structures put into place to address civil rights and labor violations — a perversion of a code of conduct that went unreported.  But it’s not an uncommon story.  “In a lot of ways each member’s office is run like a small business,” one congressional aide told Vox. “They decide how to spend money on personnel, travel, etc., and create their own office culture. It’s true offices don’t end up having an HR department — we just aren’t given the resources for that.”  Technically, there is oversight — The US Congress Office of Compliance handles workplace complaints and received 198 harassment claims in 2016, slightly up from previous years. Legally, congressional lawmakers and staff — from senators and representatives to Capitol police — are offered protections through the 1995 Congressional Accountability Act, which enacted civil rights, labor, workplace safety, and health laws to Congress and agencies under the legislative branch.  “We encourage employees to call our office to speak to a counselor on any workplace issue so it does not escalate into a violation,” Pamela Sumberg, COO deputy executive director, said.  Speier has called the system “toothless” — and conversations with staffers support her claim.  “There seems to be a lack of awareness that there is a process available,” Martin said. “I have heard from staffers that say we don’t have HR … it’s not part of the standard procedures. These offices are not especially large and function informally as a result.”  The official substitute for individual HR departments is a confusing network of oversight bodies that address different complaints in various ways. It’s a difficult system to navigate, and one that can have unsatisfactory results.  There’s an independent body that oversees that law’s enforcement — the Office of Compliance, where all staffers can report harassment and undergo confidential counseling or mediation, or file a federal suit. And in the House and Senate, ethics committees investigate members’ offices in violation of House and Senate rules of conduct. There is a fourth entity, the Office of Congressional Ethics, where members and staff can file complaints for them to be referred to the ethics committees. Not every claim is considered by the congressional ethics committees — and complaints that are can often lead to investigations and reviews that can take years.  “I didn’t even know it existed as a resource,” a former congressional staffer told Politico of the compliance office. “You don’t have an HR Department on the Hill. There’s no one place that you go. Nobody on the Hill has any idea how you report and deal with sexual harassment.”  According to Martin, the solution isn’t to only mandate workplace harassment training — although that would be a good start. To truly help remedy the situation requires establishing more formalized structures within congressional offices, strengthening the relationship with the Office of Compliance, and creating more avenues for anonymous reporting.",13.0,16.0

Tim Kaine, D-Va., Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., speak informally on tax reform and the elections with reporters in the Senate Press Gallery at the Capitol in Washington. It’s an article of faith among Republicans that the GOP’s electoral fortunes next year hinge on whether they succeed in their longstanding dream to redraft the nation’s complex, inefficient tax code. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)  WASHINGTON (AP) — It’s an article of faith among Republicans — reinforced by the party’s drubbing in this week’s off-year elections in Virginia and New Jersey — that the GOP’s electoral fortunes next year hinge on whether they succeed in their longstanding dream to redraft the nation’s complex, inefficient tax code.  Without a win on tax reform, the argument goes, Republicans are sunk in next year’s midterm elections. Core Republican voters and donors would lose faith. GOP lawmakers would have few accomplishments to run on.  “One of the things you do have to do is pass the things that you ran on,” said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., former chair of the campaign committee for House Republicans. “The other side is already whipped up. There’s nothing you can do about that. But your own side loses faith and you get a depressed turnout. If you don’t get them done, you’re guaranteed a bad midterm.”  The head of the Republican National Committee, Ronna Romney McDaniel, said GOP voters are looking to see what Congress can achieve.  “I can’t say that’s going to be the make-or-break of 2018,” she said, adding that Republicans are “facing headwinds in the coming midterms.”  “I think it’s important that we get this done,” she added.  Democrats agree that failure on tax reform would be a political disaster for Republicans. But passing the coveted tax measure wouldn’t necessarily save them from a bad midterm. The downside risk of failure, both sides say, far exceeds the upside reward.  “Without tax reform I think we’re in the minority,” said Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho. “But that doesn’t mean it’ll save us by any stretch of the imagination. I think yesterday kind of demonstrated that.”  The pending House bill, little understood by the public, performs poorly in public opinion polls. Voters are generally unenthusiastic about tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy and are skeptical that they’ll see a tax cut.  An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll taken last month found that people by large margins believe the Trump-backed tax plan helps wealthy people and corporations. Just over four in 10 in the poll said they believe that it helps middle-income individuals and families, slightly more than the number who thinks it hurts them.  Losing Virginia GOP gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie ran on a promise of across-the-board tax cuts that failed to catch on.  “We had an experiment on tax cut politics in Virginia through Ed Gillespie’s campaign. And the tax cut gambit really fell flat,” said Geoff Garin of Hart Research, lead pollster for the campaign of the Democratic governor-elect, Ralph Northam. “If the Republicans think somehow that tax cut politics will heal their problems of having to run with Donald Trump and all the damage they’ve already done to themselves on health care, the laboratory experiment we had in Virginia yesterday makes it very clear that that will not happen for them.”  The tax measure, at least as currently drafted by House Republicans, would impose tax increases on many of the affluent suburban voters who just turned against Republicans not only in Virginia, but in New Jersey and New York’s Westchester and Nassau Counties. The measure would repeal a number of deductions cherished by upper middle-income taxpayers, including the state income tax deduction, while limiting the deductibility of mortgage interest on home loans exceeding $500,000.  “Look, it’s a lose-lose for them,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. “I think even if they pass the bill, as people learn all the things that are taken away it’s going to hurt them. But I think if they can’t pass a bill their ability to get things done is questioned, even by the deep Trump supporters. So it’s a lose-lose.”  Schumer has been urging Republicans to follow the model of the successful 1986 tax reform bill, in which former President Ronald Reagan worked with both Democrats and Republicans to gore special interest provisions while lowering tax rates.  Two weeks after Reagan signed the bill, however, Republicans suffered a drubbing in the 1986 midterms, losing control of the Senate with an eight-seat loss.  In the aftermath of Tuesday’s drubbing, Republicans sought to portray an air of calm, cautioning against reading too much into the results in two states — Virginia and New Jersey — that went for Democrat Hillary Clinton in last year’s election. They said that passage of their tax overhaul bill would pay off.  “I think that’s going to bear fruit politically, but most importantly it’s going to help people,” said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., at a Wednesday morning event held by The Washington Examiner. “If anything, this just puts more pressure on making sure we follow through.”  Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said of Virginia: “I see it as a blue state staying blue.”  ___  Associated Press writer Tom Beaumont in Des Moines, Iowa, contributed to this report.",6.0,4.0

The Fox News Channel says the company knew a news analyst planned to file a sexual harassment lawsuit against O'Reilly when it renewed the popular personality's contract in February 2017. The New York Times reported Saturday, Oct. 21, 2017, the company renewed the TV host's contract after he reached a $32 million settlement with the analyst. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)  NEW YORK (AP) — The parent company of the Fox News Channel says it knew a news analyst planned to file a sexual harassment lawsuit against Bill O’Reilly when it renewed the popular personality’s contract in February.  The New York Times reported Saturday the company renewed O’Reilly’s contract after he reached a $32 million settlement with the analyst, Lis Wiehl.  In a statement, 21st Century Fox defended its decision because it said O’Reilly had settled the matter personally. It also said O’Reilly and Wiehl had agreed the financial terms would be kept confidential.  The company says O’Reilly’s new contract had added protections that allowed Fox to dismiss him if other allegations surfaced.  O’Reilly was ousted months later when it was revealed Fox had paid five women a total of $13 million to keep quiet about harassment allegations.  Mark Fabiani, a spokesman for O’Reilly, said in a statement Saturday that after 21st Century Fox fired founding CEO Roger Ailes in 2015 following harassment charges, dozens of women accused scores of male employees at Fox News Channel of harassment. The 77-year-old Ailes died in Palm Beach, Florida, last May.  21st Century Fox paid out close to $100 million dollars to settle all the cases, Fabiani said, adding that in O’Reilly’s 20 years working at the channel not one complaint was filed against him by a co-worker, even on an anonymous hotline.  Wiehl’s allegations included repeated harassment, a nonconsensual sexual relationship and the sending of gay pornography and other sexually explicit material to the woman, according to people briefed on the matter who spoke to The New York Times.  As part of the terms of their agreement, she signed an affidavit, dated Jan. 17 and obtained by the newspaper, stating that the two sides had resolved their dispute and that she had no claims against O’Reilly concerning any of the allegations in the draft complaint. All photos, text messages and other communications between the two would be destroyed, the newspaper reported.  The Associated Press emailed Wiehl on Saturday seeking comment.  The settlement was by far the largest of a half dozen deals made by O’Reilly or the company to settle harassment allegations against the host, according to the newspaper.  It was reached in January. A month later, 21st Century Fox granted O’Reilly a four-year extension on a $25 million-a-year contract. In April, it fired him.  Fabiani said the newspaper’s account was false and taken out of context. The New York Times said it stands by its reporting.  “Mr Fabiani addresses everything but what the story actually says. This article, like our previous reporting on the subject, is accurate and deeply reported and we welcome any challenge to the facts,” the newspaper said in a statement to The Associated Press on Saturday.  The most-watched figure in cable TV, O’Reilly has called his firing from the Fox News Channel a “political hit job” and that his network’s parent company made a business decision to get rid of him. O’Reilly also has said his conscience was clear in how he dealt with women.  The company said it has taken numerous steps to change its workplace environment.  “21st Century Fox has taken concerted action to transform Fox News, including installing new leaders, overhauling management and on-air talent, expanding training, and increasing the channels through which employees can report harassment or discrimination,” Fox said in a statement emailed to the AP. “These changes come from the top, with Lachlan and James Murdoch personally leading the effort to promote civility and respect on the job, while maintaining the company’s long-held commitment to a diverse, inclusive and creative workplace.”  O’Reilly hosts his “No Spin News” podcast on his website, www.billoreilly.com, contributes to Glenn Beck’s radio program on TheBlaze and continues to write books in his best-selling series of historical “Killing” books, including his newest release, “Killing England: The Brutal Struggle for American Independence.”  ____  This story has been corrected to say Ailes died in Palm Beach, Florida, not Los Angeles.",77.0,112.0
169,985,9,16,2017,2017-09-16,The New York Times,Bump in U.S. Incomes Doesn’t Erase 50 Years of Pain,"Starting with 1957, the team looked at actual earnings during the prime working years — the ages of 25 to 55. For a while, it saw a clear pattern: Younger men could expect to make more over their lives than older ones. Every year the starting rewards were higher and kept growing. So men who turned 25 in, say, 1960 would end up with a higher median cumulative income by 55 than men who had turned 25 in 1959. And the ’59ers would, in turn, do better over three decades than those who had turned 25 in 1958.  But that steady progress stopped in the late 1960s. Then, instead of increasing, lifetime earnings for men made an about-face and began to decline. They have been dropping pretty much ever since. The result was that a 25-year-old man who entered the work force in 1967 and worked for the next three decades earned as much as $250,000 more, after taking inflation into account, than a man who had the same type of career but was 15 years younger.  “That’s enough to buy a medium-size house in the United States,” said Fatih Guvenen, an economist at the University of Minnesota and a co-author of the study. “That is what you are missing from one generation to the next generation.”  And the trend appears to be continuing. “Every new cohort made less in median lifetime income than the previous one,” Mr. Guvenen said.  The result is widening lifetime inequality as well. That’s because nearly all of the financial gains have been funneled to those at the top of the income scale. For four out of five men, there was no real growth.  “And it all starts at age 25,” Mr. Guvenen said. The decline in lifetime earnings is largely a result of lower incomes at younger ages rather than at older ages, he said, and “that was very surprising to us.”",2.0,6.0
1100,2678,10,27,2017,2017-10-27,Fox News,Fit or miss? Retailers offer new tools to help shoppers,"Stores watching Amazon take a larger share of clothing sales are trying to solve one of the most vexing issues for online shoppers: Finding items that fit properly.  The retailers are unleashing tools that use artificial intelligence to replicate the help a salesperson at a store might offer, calculate a shopper's most likely body shape, or use 3D models for a virtual fitting room try-on. Amazon, which some analysts say would surpass Macy's this year as the largest U.S. clothing seller, is offering some customers an Alexa-powered device that doubles as a selfie-stick machine and a stylist.  Retailers want to reduce the rate of online returns, which can be up to 40 percent, and thus make customers happier — and more likely to be repeat shoppers. And the more interaction shoppers have with a brand, the more the technology will learn about shoppers' preferences, says Vicky Zadeh, CEO of Rakuten Fits Me, a tech company that works with QVC and clothing startup brands.  ""It's all about confidence,"" she says. ""If they have the confidence to buy, they will come back to the retailer time and time again.""  The push is coming from big names like Levi's and The Gap and startups like Rhone and Taylrd.  Levi's new Virtual Stylist texts back and forth with online customers to offer recommendations, based on their preferences. Marc Rosen, Levi's president of global e-commerce, says early tests show the chatbot is driving more browsers to become buyers.  Rakuten Fits Me, which works with QVC and other companies, fine-tuned its fit technology this summer and says its retail partners now offer garments that should fit shoppers' body shapes when the customer first does the initial search. Shoppers provide three measurements — height, weight, and age — and then it calculates a person's most likely body shape, not size, to determine the fit for any garment and offer more accurate recommendations.  And Gap Inc. has an augmented reality app in collaboration with Google and startup Avametric that allows shoppers to virtually try on clothes. Shoppers enter information like height and weight and then the app puts a 3D model in front of them. However, the tool only works on Google Tango smartphones.  Sebastian DiGrande, executive vice president and strategy and chief customer officer at Gap, says its augmented reality app has received good feedback, but it's still determining whether shoppers really want a virtual 3D model.  Clothing brand Tommy Hilfiger similarly has built its mobile app around the camera and image recognition. It has an augmented reality feature enabling shoppers to see what the clothes look like on a virtual runway model — but not their own body type.  And men's online clothier Bonobos, now owned by Walmart, launched an app that offers customers a virtual closet to see items they bought and saved. The app is converting browsers to buyers at a faster rate, says Andy Dunn, founder of Bonobos.  Companies are smart to offer new tools, but many are too ""gimmicky,"" says Sapna Shah, principal at Red Giraffe Advisors, which makes early stage investments in fashion tech.  ""If it's not Amazon, will brand-specific apps be the way for people to shop in the future?"" she continued. ""How many apps are people going to have on their phone?""  And all the companies need to win over customers who prefer to touch and see things in person.  ""It's great that they're busting their tail with all these apps, but I am skeptical,"" said Doug Garnett of Portland, Oregon. Garnett says he buys some clothes online when he knows and understands the brands, but otherwise, he says, ""I really need to see them on my body before I act, and really prefer that to be in a store.""  As Amazon dives further into fashion, it could use its base of data to spur trends and personalize offers for its customers. Its Echo Look features a built-in camera that photographs and records shoppers trying on clothes and offers recommendations on outfits. It works with its Style Check app using machine learning and advice from experts. The potential: learn shoppers' styles and recommend outfits to buy. Amazon reportedly is exploring the idea of quickly fulfilling online orders for custom-fit clothing.  The company also reportedly acquired Body Labs, which creates true-to-life 3D body models.  ""We're always listening to our customers, learning and innovating on their behalf and bringing them products we think they will love,"" said Amazon spokeswoman Molly Wade. She wouldn't comment on the prospect of custom-fit or the reports about Body Labs.  Steve Barr, the U.S. retail and consumer sector leader at consultants PwC, says that Amazon is trying for a curated experience based on massive data analytics. But he thinks it has limitations against well-loved brands.  ""No matter how great Amazon is with artificial intelligence and predictive behaviors,"" Barr said, ""they can't put a red tab on a pair of a jeans or a swoosh on a pair of shoes.""  _____  Follow Anne D'Innocenzio at https://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio",55.0,69.0

966,2506,10,24,2017,2017-10-24,Vox,The infamous Trump/Russia dossier was funded in part by Hillary Clinton’s campaign lawyer,"It’s long been known that research that went into the “Steele dossier” — an infamous document filled with lurid allegations about Donald Trump’s links to Russia that eventually drew FBI interest — was funded by Trump’s political enemies, including some Democrats.  But now, thanks to a new report from the Washington Post’s Adam Entous, Devlin Barrett, and Rosalind Helderman, we’ve learned just who those Democrats were: Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and the DNC. (Politico soon confirmed the report.)  Per the Post, in April 2016, lawyer Marc Elias, working on behalf of the Clinton campaign and the DNC, started paying the opposition research company Fusion GPS to look into Trump’s ties to Russia. Former British spy Christopher Steele did this work for Fusion, and authored what became known as the Steele dossier, which contained salacious (and uncorroborated) political financial, and sexual allegations about Trump and his top associates.  Before that point, Fusion GPS had reportedly already done research into Trump, on behalf of a Republican client. But we don’t yet know who that Republican client is.  As the Russia scandal has swirled, Republicans, including President Trump, have for months tried to call greater attention to the question of just who paid for the research behind the dossier. GOP congressional committees have been investigating the matter, and conservative media outlets have often sought to portray this as the real Russia scandal.  Workers of firm involved with the discredited and Fake Dossier take the 5th. Who paid for it, Russia, the FBI or the Dems (or all)? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 19, 2017  Republicans have questioned whether the dossier contained either disinformation peddled by Russians or deliberately false smears peddled by Trump’s political enemies. They have also inquired about the FBI’s approach to the dossier — the bureau reportedly started looking into its allegations last year, and there have been questions about whether the FBI at some point last year paid Steele for the dossier.  Now, however, we know that the dossier’s research during much of 2016 was funded by a top lawyer working for the Clinton campaign itself. That of course doesn’t necessarily mean the information in it is deliberately false — campaigns usually try to dig up opposition research that is true, if they can.  But it certainly presents the possibility that the research of the dossier and subsequent circulation of it were more akin to a dirty trick than a genuine, disinterested effort to find the truth about Trump and Russia. After all, if a campaign hires a firm to find dirt on their opponent, that is what that firm will try to deliver, even if what it turns up is dubious or thinly sourced.  Overall, viewing this uncorroborated document very skeptically was always a good idea, and the fact that its funders were Trump’s biggest opponents only makes that more the case.",15.0,16.0

He is accompanied by the chiefs of some of the most ambitious and influential American companies: Boeing, Goldman Sachs, Westinghouse Electric and Qualcomm, among others.  The expected outcome? Not much, to the frustration of some American business executives.  Mr. Trump’s meetings this week with Xi Jinping, China’s president, and other Chinese leaders come at a difficult time for both countries. Each has been consumed with domestic issues, from West Wing infighting and a special counsel investigation in Washington to a sensitive leadership transition in Beijing.  The Trump administration in particular has been stretched thin on trade. It has been slow to fill important trade-related positions, because of distractions and the lengthy congressional confirmation process. The administration has been preoccupied with rewriting the North American Free Trade Agreement and a United States trade deal with South Korea.  Trade has also been supplanted by North Korea as the most talked-about issue in Northeast Asia for President Trump, and an issue on which he wants Chinese cooperation, not confrontation. With the administration also trying to push tax policy changes through Congress, two top economic officials are not even joining the trip, but staying in Washington — Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Gary D.

330,1666,10,6,2017,2017-10-06,Breitbart,Trump Administration Rescinds Obamacare’s HHS Contraceptive Mandate,"President Donald Trump has followed through with his promise to Americans who object to the Obamacare contraceptive mandate for religious or moral reasons by officially ending the Obama-era rule.  As expected, the Trump administration announced the end of the controversial mandate that has required employers to provide free contraception, sterilization procedures, and abortion-inducing drugs to their employees through health insurance plans.  In early May, Trump signed an executive order protecting free speech and religious liberty for American faith groups. Part of the order directed the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to reexamine the contraceptive mandate.  A senior official with the administration said on background in a press briefing Thursday evening the new rule provides full protection for Americans with religious beliefs and moral convictions and acknowledges that the contraceptive mandate concerns serious issues of moral concern, including those involving human life.  According to the official, the rule will nevertheless leave free contraception in place for the vast majority of women since the new rule only covers moral and religious objections.  The mandate was inserted into Obamacare by former HHS secretary Kathleen Sebelius – an abortion activist – and bureaucrats in her department. Following objections by many religious employers to the requirements of the mandate, the Obama administration devised “accommodations” that only gave the appearance the religious groups would not be either footing the bill for, or passively approving of, the federal government’s mandate of the offensive contraceptive drugs and sterilization procedures.  Planned Parenthood – which benefits financially from wider distribution of contraceptives – NARAL, and other feminist groups have attempted to portray Trump and other Republicans as intent on taking away women’s birth control by reversing the mandate. The Obama administration itself, however, actually exempted at least 25 million Americans, through various exemption allowances, from its own rule.  The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty – which represented the Little Sisters of the Poor in its case against the HHS mandate, noted the Obama administration had exempted large corporations such as Chevron, Exxon, Visa, and Pepsi Bottling from the rule, as well as the U.S. military and large cities like New York City.  The Little Sisters – which provides care for the elderly poor – became a central focus of the HHS mandate when the religious order stood to receive onerous fines of up to $70 million at the hands of the federal government for not complying with the Obamacare requirement to provide drugs and procedures that violate their faith principles.  Becket Law said a new rule by the Trump administration would fulfill the Supreme Court’s ruling in Zubik vs. Burwell last year as well as President Donald Trump’s promise to Americans of faith and moral convictions.  The Supreme Court’s decision in Zubik to send back the case of the Little Sisters and other faith organizations to the lower courts in effect protected groups such as the Little Sisters from the contraceptive mandate’s onerous fines. The new Trump administration rule will now protect a larger group of employers from the mandate, and not just the “closely held” private companies – such as Hobby Lobby – which the U.S. Supreme Court also ruled could be exempt due to religious objections.  According to senior administration officials, the new rule expands exemptions to include other nonprofit organizations and for-profit groups – both closely-held and some that are publicly traded if they have religious objections, as well as other kinds of employers with religious objections.  Colleges and universities with religious objections that provide health insurance for students may also be exempt from the contraceptive mandate according to the new rule.  The mandate’s end also means that individuals with religious or moral objections may receive an exemption if their employer or the insurance company that issues their health insurance is willing to provide them with a plan consistent with their beliefs.  Insurance companies themselves may be exempt under the new rule, according to senior HHS officials, though only to the extent that they offer a plan to groups or individuals who themselves have an exemption based on religious or moral objections.  During his presidential campaign, Trump had promised faith leaders and employers relief from the Obamacare mandate.  In a letter to the Catholic Leadership Conference in October of 2016, Trump told Catholic leaders just prior to his election that Hillary Clinton’s support for the HHS mandate “is a hostility to religious liberty you will never see in a Trump Administration.”  Trump wrote:  On life, I am, and will remain, pro-life. I will defend your religious liberties and the right to fully and freely practice your religion, as individuals, business owners and academic institutions. I will make absolutely certain religious orders like The Little Sisters of Poor are not bullied by the federal government because of their religious beliefs.  The president invited the Little Sisters on stage with him at his first National Day of Prayer event at the White House in May and said to them, “I want you to know that your long ordeal will soon be over.”  “We will not allow people of faith to be targeted, bullied, or silenced anymore,” the president said. “We will never ever stand for religious discrimination.  “No American should be forced to choose between the dictates of the federal government and the tenets of their faith,” Trump added.",1.0,5.0

1109,2687,10,27,2017,2017-10-27,The New York Times,U.S. Economy’s 3% Spurt Emboldens Tax Cut Supporters (and Critics),"Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement on Friday that “our economy produced solid growth last quarter” and went on to say that tax reform was a way to “continue this growth” and “reinvigorate America’s economy.”  On Friday, Mr. Hassett and the Council of Economic Advisers released projections of how one prospective provision of the tax plan — a reduction in corporate tax rates to 20 percent from 35 percent — would affect economic growth. They said it would expand output by 3 to 5 percent over the long run, a period left unspecified.  The complication is that faster growth could undermine the party’s case that tax cuts are needed to add fuel to an economy that is already running with low unemployment — and it could lead the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates more quickly, which could dampen the effects of any tax bill.  Liberal economists said the report showed the success of Ms. Yellen at the Fed and undermined the case for the Republican tax bill. “The underlying trend in G.D.P. growth is clearly telling us two things,” Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser to President Barack Obama who is now at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said by email. “Keep on rockin’ steady with Yellen at the Fed, and there’s no need for a big, wasteful tax cut.”  The Fed, judging that the economy is growing about as fast as it can, is on course to raise its benchmark interest rate in December to a level Fed officials have described as likely neither to encourage nor to discourage growth. The Fed’s plans do not reflect the potential economic impact of a tax cut.  Aside from the details of the legislation, the Fed’s reaction may also depend on its leadership. Mr. Trump is expected to announce next week whom he will nominate to lead the Fed after Ms. Yellen’s term ends in early February.  The growth figure released on Friday was the government’s first estimate of economic output for the quarter, and it will be revised twice. Economists initially expected that Hurricanes Harvey and Irma would deal a blow to the country’s steady growth — a prospect reinforced by a net job loss in September — but became more optimistic in recent weeks.",33.0,47.0
1037,2614,10,25,2017,2017-10-25,Associated Press News,Study: More evidence links earthquakes to energy waste wells," In this June 21, 2014, file photo, signs warn against trespassing at a well injection site in Azle, Texas. Researchers at the University of Colorado have found more evidence that an increase in earthquakes on the Colorado-New Mexico border since 2001 was caused by wells that inject wastewater from oil and gas production back underground. Quakes in Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas have also been linked to the practice. (AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez, File)  DENVER (AP) — Scientists say they have more evidence that an increase in earthquakes on the Colorado-New Mexico border since 2001 has been caused by wells that inject wastewater from oil and gas production back underground, similar to human-caused quakes in Oklahoma and other states.  A paper published last week by researchers at the University of Colorado concluded that the wastewater caused a big enough increase in underground pressure to make rock formations slip along fault lines.  “You find that the pressure changes at a given depth are enough to trigger earthquakes,” said Jenny Nakai, the paper’s lead author and a doctoral student at the university.  The paper, published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth, is the latest to link wastewater injection wells to earthquakes.  Most oil and gas wells produce at least some wastewater that is too salty to use, so regulators allow energy companies to pump it back underground to get rid of it. Researchers have linked earthquakes in Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas to wastewater injection.  Oklahoma had only a few dozen earthquakes of magnitude-3.0 or greater in 2012 but had more than 900 in 2015. The number dropped to closer to 600 last year after state regulators directed energy companies to close some injection wells or reduce the volume of water they inject.  In the Raton Basin of northern New Mexico and southern Colorado, earthquakes began to increase in 2001, about two years after large-scale wastewater injection began, the U.S. Geological Survey said. The wastewater comes from wells that extract natural gas from underground coal beds.  The biggest quake in the basin since 2001 was magnitude-5.3 in 2011. It caused minor damage to buildings in Trinidad, Colorado, about 15 miles from the epicenter.  A 2014 paper by the Geological Survey blamed injection wells for the area’s quakes. The new University of Colorado study went further, using computer models and records of wastewater injection to conclude that enough pressure built up to cause the quakes.  Justin Rubinstein, a geophysicist with the Geological Survey who was the lead author of the 2014 paper, said the computer models have been used in other locations but not in the Raton Basin before now.  Rubinstein was not involved in the University of Colorado study and said he was not familiar with all its details but that the general conclusions made sense.  “It’s consistent with what my research has shown,” he said.  The University of Colorado study also found that the Raton Basin earthquakes were more widespread than previously thought, said Nakai, the lead author.  Earlier studies focused on the Colorado portion of the basin because that was the site of a 2001 swarm of 12 quakes — the strongest was magnitude-4.6 — as well as the 5.3 quake in 2011.  But seismometers recorded 1,881 quakes in the area between 2008 and 2010, and 1,442 of them were in New Mexico, Nakai said. The strongest was magnitude-3.8.  The 2008-2010 data came from a temporary deployment of seismometers as part of two other research projects funded by the National Science Foundation, Nakai said.  ___  Follow Dan Elliott at http://twitter.com/DanElliottAP .

On Sunday, Oct. 1, 2017, Stephen Paddock opened fire on the Route 91 Harvest festival killing dozens and wounding hundreds. Paddock left behind little clues about what led him to carry out the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. He killed 58 and wounded nearly 500 before killing himself. Paddock's brain is being sent to Stanford University for a months-long examination after a visual inspection during an autopsy found ""no abnormalities,"" Las Vegas authorities said. Doctors will perform multiple forensic analyses, including an exam of the 64-year-old's brain tissue to find any neurological problems. (Courtesy of Eric Paddock via AP, File)  LAS VEGAS (AP) — Scientists are preparing to do a microscopic study of the Las Vegas gunman’s brain, but whatever they find, if anything, likely won’t be what led him to kill 58 people in the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history, experts said.  Stephen Paddock’s brain is being sent to Stanford University for a months-long examination after a visual inspection during an autopsy found no abnormalities, Las Vegas authorities said.  Doctors will perform multiple forensic analyses, including an exam of the 64-year-old’s brain tissue to find any possible neurological problems.  The brain will arrive in California soon, and Stanford has been instructed to spare no expense for the work, The New York Times reported. It will be further dissected to determine if Paddock suffered from health problems such as strokes, blood vessel diseases, tumors, some types of epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, degenerative disorders, physical trauma and infections.  Dr. Hannes Vogel, Stanford University Medical Center’s director of neuropathology, would not discuss the procedure with The Associated Press and referred questions to officials in Clark County, where Las Vegas is located. They also refused to provide details.  Vogel told The Times that he will leave nothing overlooked to put to rest much of the speculation on Paddock’s health as investigators struggle to identify a motive for the shooting.  The examination will come about a month after Paddock unleashed more than a thousand bullets through the windows of a 32nd floor suite at the Mandalay Bay casino-hotel into a crowd below attending an outdoor country music festival. After killing 58 people and wounding hundreds more, Paddock took his own life with a shot through his mouth, police say.  Investigators working around the clock remain frustrated by a lack of clues that would point to his motive. Authorities have resorted to putting up billboards in southern Nevada seeking tips and now the intensive brain study that medical experts say likely won’t yield definitive answers.  If a disease is found, experts say it would be false science to conclude it caused or perhaps even contributed to the massacre, even if that explanation would ease the minds of investigators and the world at large.  “There’s a difference between association and causality, and just because you have anything, doesn’t mean it does anything,” said Brian Peterson, president of the National Association of Medical Examiners and chief coroner of Wisconsin’s Milwaukee County.  The microscopic study is not a standard practice but is regularly used as needed. Families sometimes request such a detailed examination to better understand their own genetic risks.  Peterson said it’s also common in high-profile cases such as Paddock’s, where so much is riding on the results that all forensic options must be exhausted.  Douglas Fields, a neuroscientist who studies the rage circuit in brain systems, said horribly violent events, such as mass shootings and terrorism, rarely involve actual brain abnormalities but can be triggered by psychiatric problems.  Perpetrators often are suicidal psychopaths who are motivated to commit heinous crimes because they have internalized their isolation and anti-social behavior as an existential threat for themselves, he said.  “When police look for motive, it’s kind of misplaced in cases like this because they appear to be crimes of rage. There’s no motive for crimes of rage. It’s a crime of passion,” Fields said.  One such case involved the University of Texas shooter Charles Whitman, who fatally shot 13 people in 1966 from a clock tower on the Austin campus. Whitman was found to have a pecan-sized tumor in his brain, though the suggestion that it caused his rampage is still debated decades later.  Peterson, who is not involved in the Paddock case, said an initial inspection that is standard for any autopsy would generally include dissecting the brain at one-centimeter intervals to look for issues identifiable to the trained eye — infection, tumor, symmetry, bleeding and blood vessel abnormality.  A further study would involve a microscopic focus on the tissue cells, such as using stains to determine different types of dementia and other degenerative diseases, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which is sometimes found in people who have suffered repetitive brain trauma.  There also would likely be a review of the brain at a molecular level though DNA, Peterson said.  Experts say the brain study on Paddock will be a worthy effort for scientific reasons.  Dr. Paul S. Appelbaum, a psychiatry expert at Columbia University, said that at minimum, it might yield something even tangential that can be passed on to the public, such as awareness for psychological disorders or brain diseases.  “Are we ever going to know for certain what caused his brain to do that?” Appelbaum asked. “Probably not from a neuropathological examination, but it’s not unreasonable to ask and see whether it might contribute to our understanding of what occurred.”  ___  Follow Sally Ho at https://twitter.com/_sallyho.",7.0,3.0

Bannon was speaking at an event organized by the institute: “Countering Violent Extremism: Qatar, Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood” in Washington, D.C. Bannon was referring to the Arab Islamic American Summit held in Saudi Arabia in May, where Trump met with Arab leaders to organize a united front against ISIS and to stop the financing of terrorism.  Bannon said that specifically, the point of the summit was to stop the financing of the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas, and also Iran’s aggressive anti-Western strategy.  ‘I don’t think it’s just by happenstance that two weeks after that summit that you saw the blockade of the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain [and] Egypt and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on Qatar,” he said.  Just eight months into Trump’s term, Bannon also noted, ISIS has largely been wiped out after major defeats in Mosul, Iraq, and Raqqa, Syria. The latter is arguably a more significant defeat for the terror group as Raqqa was the group’s de facto capital in the Middle East. But last week it fell to U.S.-backed troops.  As Breitbart News reported last week, analysts caution that ISIS has not been destroyed, but with these twin defeats, it has been broken down from a terror state back into a terrorist organization.  Bannon noted that despite Trump being criticized during the campaign for his perceived lack of foreign policy knowledge, he has achieved a victory that would have been seen as almost impossible just a year ago.  “President Trump has accomplished something that I think people would have mocked and laughed at him in the campaign,” Bannon said. “Raqqa fell the other day, the physical destruction of ISIS’s caliphate, which shocked the world with its rapid rise.”  He put the victory down to changing the strategy from a war of attrition, to a war of annihilation.  “In eight months of President Trump’s strategy, executed by General Mattis, and that strategy was not a war of attrition, he was very specific from day one, this is a war of annihilation: ‘we will annihilate the caliphate’ and that’s been accomplished,” he said.

789,2218,10,20,2017,2017-10-20,The New York Times,Obama Attacks Tactics of Republican Candidate for Governor in Virginia," Former President Barack Obama, returning to the campaign trail on Thursday for the first time since leaving the White House, issued an unexpectedly stinging attack on the immigration-focused campaign of the Republican candidate for Virginia governor.  Seeking to lift the candidacy of Lt. Gov. Ralph S. Northam, the Democratic nominee for governor, Mr. Obama abandoned nine months of self-imposed political silence to accuse Ed Gillespie, the Republican, of fear-mongering tactics that he called “damaging and corrosive to our democracy.”  While not mentioning President Trump by name, Mr. Obama seemed to have the racially tinged 2016 presidential campaign on his mind as he denounced a controversial commercial that Mr. Gillespie has aired that targets the gang MS-13 — which has roots in Central America — and features a group of heavily tattooed Salvadoran prisoners.  “What he’s really trying to deliver is fear,” Mr. Obama said of Mr. Gillespie. “What he really believes is that if you scare enough voters, it might score just enough votes to win an election.”",67.0,65.0
1005,2563,10,25,2017,2017-10-25,Fox News,"Trump rips Clinton link to Fusion GPS dossier as a 'disgrace,' says Russia 'hoax is turned around'","President Trump, in a wide-ranging sparring session with reporters Wednesday afternoon, blasted Hillary Clinton over new revelations her campaign helped fund a salacious anti-Trump dossier last year – calling the project a “disgrace” and claiming the tables have turned on Democrats over the “Russia hoax.”  “They’re embarrassed by it, but I think it’s a disgrace,” Trump told reporters, before heading to Texas for a briefing on Hurricane Harvey recovery efforts and a Republican fundraiser. “It’s a very sad commentary on politics in this country.”  In the midst of a court case that threatened to reveal the dossier’s funding, it emerged Tuesday night that political consulting firm Fusion GPS was retained last year by Marc E. Elias, an attorney representing the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign. The firm then hired former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele to write the dossier that contained unverified and lurid allegations about Trump and his team’s ties to Moscow.  The Washington Post first reported on the connections, which were confirmed by Fox News.  Trump, though, repeatedly said Wednesday that this information only came out because the court case would have revealed it. Amid a series of Russia-related controversies that have Democrats – at least for now – on defense, Trump suggested the allegations of Russia collusion with his campaign have boomeranged and are hurting Democrats.  “The whole Russia thing … this was the Democrats coming up with an excuse for losing the election,” Trump told reporters. “They lost it and they lost it very badly. And they didn’t know what to say, so they made up the whole Russia hoax.”  Trump added: “Now it’s turning out that the hoax is turned around, and you look at what’s happened with Russia and the uranium deal and the fake dossier, and it’s all turned around.”  'The whole Russia thing...this was the Democrats coming up with an excuse for losing the election' — President Donald Trump  Trump was referring not only to the dossier but the Obama administration’s 2010 approval of a Canadian mining company’s sale to a Russian firm that gave them partial control of U.S. uranium reserves.  The law firm that retained Fusion GPS reportedly was paid millions in legal fees by the Clinton campaign and the DNC.  Sources, however, told The Post that neither the Clinton campaign nor the DNC specifically directed Steele’s work, labeling the intelligence officer simply as a Fusion GPS subcontractor.  The Democratic National Committee, meanwhile, stressed that the current leadership was not involved in the arrangement.  “Tom Perez and the new leadership of the DNC were not involved in any decision-making regarding Fusion GPS, nor were they aware that Perkins Coie was working with the organization,"" DNC Communications Director Xochitl Hinojosa said in a statement. ""But let’s be clear, there is a serious federal investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia, and the American public deserves to know what happened.”  A spokesman for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., who led the DNC at the time, told Fox News on Wednesday that, “She did not have any knowledge of this arrangement.”  What exactly Hillary Clinton knew is unclear. But Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement that, “I personally wasn’t aware of this during the campaign.” However, he said, “if I had gotten handed it last fall, I would have had no problem passing it along and urging reporters to look into it.”  The Washington Post report noted that while Elias and his law firm retained Fusion GPS in April 2016, the firm’s research before that was funded by an “unknown Republican client” during the GOP primary.  Asked Wednesday if he knows who that was, Trump teased the media.  “I think I would know but I won’t say,” he said. “I have one name in mind. … It will probably be revealed.”  During his Q&A with reporters on the White House lawn, the president pivoted to a range of other subjects, including Republican unity as compared with Democratic unity.  “I’ll tell you what—honestly, the Republicans are very, very well united,” Trump said, while claiming there’s “hatred, division and animosity” between Democrats like Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton.  The president covered immigration, tax reform and opioid abuse.  Trump told reporters he would “love to do a DACA deal,” but he needed something “very substantial” to complete legislation helping so-called dreamers -- listing “the wall” and the ability to “stop drugs from pouring in” to the U.S. Trump again vowed that at some point, the administration would declare a “national emergency” for the opioid epidemic.  Trump jumped to tax reform, promising an “incredible” plan.  “We’re going to bring back $4 trillion, I think at least, from overseas, and that money is going to be put back into our country,” Trump said.  He also defended his phone conversations with Gold Star families, amid controversy over one phone call with the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, who was killed in Niger.  “It’s a rough time for these people. It’s a tough time. It couldn’t be tougher. But I have such respect for those families,” Trump said.  Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., as well as the widow, Myeshia Johnson, had criticized Trump’s tone during that call.",12.0,21.0
774,2193,10,18,2017,2017-10-18,Associated Press News,Ohio seeks technology ideas to solve national opioid crisis," Ohio launched an $8 million effort Wednesday to attract ideas for using technology to solve the national opioid addiction crisis that has touched scores of families, including that of Columbus mother Jacqueline Lewis, who said solutions can’t come too soon.  During a news conference announcing the Ohio Opioid Technology Challenge, Lewis detailed her 29-year-old son’s struggle with addiction to painkillers and heroin. She said she supports any effort that encourages understanding that addiction is a disease, not a choice.  “To me, what this is all about is the possibilities with this in educating and raising that awareness and seeing all the entities coming together. That is so necessary,” she said. “It’s like a village raising the children. You need that; you need everybody in the same boat.”  Ohio is pitching the challenge globally. It’s similar in its mission to an effort the NFL used to generate new ideas to diagnose and prevent concussions.  It was launched after Republican Ohio Gov. John Kasich used his State of the State speech this year to call on the state’s Third Frontier Commission to provide funding to help accelerate scientific and technological breakthroughs that could help solve the U.S. opioid problem. Ohio is among the hardest hit U.S. states.  Development Services Director David Goodman, who chairs the commission, said the challenge is exciting and original.  “This is a tool, an opportunity to have a forum with folks from all over the world, the billions of people that live on this planet who are aware of this and who have that light bulb go off in their head: ‘I have this idea, I’ve told people about it, I don’t know what to do with it,’” Goodman said. “Now you have a tool to use.”  The challenge will roll out in three phases: the idea, challenge and product stages.  The idea generation phase begins immediately and lasts through Dec. 15. It allows both technical and non-technical audiences — researchers, caregivers, entrepreneurs and civilians alike — to submit their unique concepts. Ideas are being accepted through a dedicated website established for the project.  Up to five ideas deemed to have the highest likelihood of leading to a solution to the opioid abuse and addition crisis that’s ravaged the nation will be selected for cash awards of $10,000. Forty runners-up — 20 civilians and 20 technical professionals or experts — will be entered into a drawing to win $500 cash prizes.  Winning ideas will be advanced during the second and third phases. Keith Jenkins, opioid programs director of the Third Frontier Commission, said $6.5 million will be invested during those phases to start. Corporations are being solicited to add additional money to the challenge.  NineSigma North America CEO Andy Zynga, whose firm was selected to run the challenge, said such contests are known to encourage ideas across industries.  He said the Head Health Challenge launched by the NFL, GE and Under Armour generated some 1,000 ideas that included new helmet safety technologies developed from plastics and medical devices resembling “tricorders like on Star Trek” that could scan for brain injuries.  “Who knows? There may be a technology from food and beverage that has high-impact polymers that can be used for something like this,” he said. “Breakthroughs are shown to happen when you have technologies from other domains that are applied in different ways in the innovators’ domain.”",4.0,8.0
1292,2891,11,1,2017,2017-11-01,Vox,Poll: 59% of Americans said this is the lowest point in US history they can remember,"For a recent poll, the American Psychological Association asked Americans, “How stressed are you about the future of the country?” The answer, on average, was:  The APA has been conducting its Stress in America poll every year since 2007, and the latest one finds that 63 percent of Americans say the future of the country is a very significant source of stress in their lives.  Even more tellingly, 59 percent said this is the “lowest point in our nation’s history that they can remember.” And this sentiment transcended generations: A majority of baby boomers, Gen X-ers, millennials, and adults over the age of 72 felt it.  To help underscore just how difficult people perceive the current moment to be, the APA made a graphic to remind us of the most horrible events each generation has lived through, including World War II, the Vietnam War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the September 11 terrorist attacks. And again each group all said now is the worst time.  The poll was conducted — in both English and Spanish — with 3,440 people throughout the month of August and has been weighted to reflect the demographics of the country. (Read about the methodology here.)  But there’s other data to suggest people are feeling pretty pessimistic this year. An October Gallup poll found just 21 percent of Americans are satisfied with the direction the country is heading in.  Also: Just look around.  In August — during the time the APA poll was conducted — white supremacists descended on Charlottesville, and the resulting chaos there left one woman dead. And the beginning of the year was filled with uncertainties: About the future of health care, about the future of American leadership in the world. “When asked what specific issues in our country cause them stress, Americans’ most common responses were health care (43 percent) and the economy (35 percent),” the APA found.  And it seems safe to assume the nation’s mood probably hasn’t lifted since this survey was conducted. We’ve had a historically bloody mass shooting that made October 2 the saddest day ever recorded on Twitter. And there’s been the continued drip-drip of news about how Russia successfully influenced the 2016 election, Cabinet officials resigning in scandal, massive debilitating hurricanes and an ongoing humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico, increased tensions with a nuclear North Korea, and a president constantly picking fights on Twitter.  Fifty six percent of APA survey respondents said watching the news is stressful. No kidding.  The APA hadn’t asked the question about whether this is the lowest point in US history before this year, so we don’t know how this year really compares. But other measures suggest the national mood probably isn’t at a historic rock bottom. In October 2008, during the worst of the financial crisis, just 7 percent of respondents said they were satisfied with the direction of the country, per Gallup.  There is also some (relatively) good news in the APA survey. Overall, Americans are reporting around the same levels of stress as last year. On average, Americans rate their stress at a 4.8 out of 10. Though “Americans are more likely [than last year] to report symptoms of stress, which include anxiety, anger and fatigue,” the APA finds.  Young people are most stressed out of all. “Millennials continue to have the highest reported stress levels, with this year’s survey finding an average stress level of 5.7, a slight increase from 2016,” the APA reports. There’s no clear reason why (though two out of five millennials say the economy is a stressor in their lives). Boomer and Gen X-er stress actually went down a bit, on average, from last year.  Stress is awful. It impacts our health in a subtle, sinister way: keeping us up at night, keeping our muscles tense, and straining our hearts. Breathe deep, America. Breathe deep.

1513,3181,11,7,2017,2017-11-07,Vox,Ed Gillespie’s loss shows Donald Trump has made Trumpism toxic,"Ed Gillespie was the quintessential establishment Republican: senior adviser to President George W. Bush, chair of the Republican National Committee, founder of a bipartisan lobbying firm. He was also the GOP’s nominee for governor in Virginia, and he was losing.  Then he embraced Trumpism. He began running bizarre, fearmongering ads about Hispanic gangs and sanctuary cities. The polls narrowed, Democrats panicked, Trumpists began celebrating. Two days ago, Steve Bannon, Donald Trump’s former chief strategist, told the New York Times that Gillespie had “closed an enthusiasm gap by rallying around the Trump agenda … in Gillespie’s case, Trumpism without Trump can show the way forward.”  This was the Democrats’ worst nightmare: that Trumpism might work better without Trump. That Gillespie could take Trump’s culture-war playbook — his attacks on immigrants and diversity and disorder — and, in severing it from Trump’s erratic personal behavior, do what Trump couldn’t: win blueish states like Virginia.  Except Gillespie lost. He lost by more than Trump did. He lost by more than other Republicans running in Virginia. Trumpism without Trump didn’t just fail to win. It collapsed.  The reason, I suspect, is that Bannon had it exactly backward. The age of Trumpism without Trump isn’t ahead of us. It’s behind us, at least for now. Trumpism without Trump was possible before Trump was president. It might be possible after he’s president. It’s not possible while he’s president.  In 2016, Trump had the advantage of being a true outsider: He had no record to answer for, no unemployment rate to explain, no votes to justify. For all his oddities and eccentricities, he was a blank slate — a businessman to those who wanted a businessman, a culture warrior to those who wanted a culture warrior, a pragmatist to those who wanted a pragmatist, a conservative to those who wanted a conservative, and so on. He was theory severed from practice; “ism” without the reality check of is.  But now we have Trumpism with Trump, and the American people don’t much like it. Trump is no longer an abstraction, Trumpism no longer an idea. Instead, we are watching the real thing: a White House in chaos, a legislative agenda in shambles, a world in which nuclear war is likelier and America’s global leadership is diminished. Trump isn’t merely unpopular; he is less popular than any president at this point in their term since the advent of modern polling, and he is that unpopular even though the economy is growing and Americans are not dying in large numbers overseas.  The result is that a wave election appears to be building. As Vox’s Matt Yglesias notes, across the special elections held over the past year, Democratic candidates have outperformed Hillary Clinton’s 2016 margin by 11 points and Barack Obama’s 2012 margin by 9 points. If you average recent polls, Democrats hold a 9-point advantage on the generic congressional ballot. Tonight, in Virginia, Republicans saw what that means.  It is still possible that the theory was correct, that Trumpism without Trump might have been a winning formula. For now, however, that will remain untested. Trump is the president of the United States, and so there is no such thing as Trumpism without Trump, there is only Trumpism with Trump, and the dysfunction and disappointment and backlash it creates.",1.0,5.0
432,1777,6,13,2017,2017-06-13,Vox,Persuasive proof that America is full of racist and selfish people,"“Google is a digital truth serum,” Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, author of Everybody Lies, told me in a recent interview. “People tell Google things that they don't tell to possibly anybody else, things they might not tell to family members, friends, anonymous surveys, or doctors.”  Stephens-Davidowitz was working on a PhD in economics at Harvard when he became obsessed with Google Trends, a tool that tracks how frequently searches are made in a given area over a given time period.  He spent five years combing through this data. The idea was that you could get far better real-time information about what people are thinking by looking at Google Trends data than you could through polls or some other survey device.  It turns out he was right.  As a barometer of our national consciousness, Google is as accurate (and predictive) as it gets. In 2016, when the Republican primaries were just beginning, most pundits and pollsters did not believe Trump could win. After all, he had insulted veterans, women, minorities, and countless other constituencies.  But Stephens-Davidowitz saw clues in his Google research that suggested Trump was far more serious than many supposed. Searches containing racist epithets and jokes were spiking across the country during Trump’s primary run, and not merely in the South but in upstate New York, Western Pennsylvania, Eastern Ohio, rural Illinois, West Virginia, and industrial Michigan.  Stephens-Davidowitz saw in the Google Trends data a racially polarized electorate, and one primed to respond to the ethno-nationalist rhetoric of Trump.  There were earlier signs, too. On Obama’s 2008 election night, Stephens-Davidowitz found that “one in every hundred Google searches that included the word ‘Obama’ also included ‘KKK’” or the n-word. Searches for racist websites like Stormfront also spiked.  “There was a darkness and hatred that was hidden from traditional sources,” Stephens-Davidowitz says. “Those searches are hard to reconcile with a society in which racism is a small factor.”  Racial attitudes are just one of the many interesting discoveries in Stephens-Davidowitz’s research. He also explores the disconnect between our social media lives and our actual lives, between what we talk about publicly and what we think about privately.  I spoke with him about the book and why he thinks Google Trends is ""the most important data set ever collected on the human psyche."" I also ask him about his most startling finding, which is that America is experiencing a crisis of self-induced abortions in places where access to abortion clinics is sparse.  Our lightly edited conversation follows.  Sean Illing  You refer to Google as a digital truth serum. What does it tell us about ourselves?  Seth Stephens-Davidowitz  People tell Google things that they don't tell to possibly anybody else, things they might not tell to family members, friends, anonymous surveys, doctors. People feel very comfortable confessing things to Google. In general, Google tells us that people are different than they present themselves. One way they're different, I have to say, is that they’re nastier and meaner than they often present themselves.  I've done a lot of research on racism, for example, and I was shocked by how frequently people make racist searches, particularly for jokes mocking African Americans. This concealed ugliness can predict a lot of behaviors, particularly in the political realm.  Sean Illing  Speaking of politics, you believed way back in early 2016 that Trump was a serious candidate. You were looking at Google search activity, saw a spike in racist and misogynistic searches, and thought that was a sign of things to come.  Seth Stephens-Davidowitz  Yeah, I did say that I thought Trump was going to win very, very early, but I'm not sure if that was based purely on the data or just because I'm a total pessimist. I always have been fairly pessimistic about this kind of thing.  Sean Illing  Welcome to the club.  Seth Stephens-Davidowitz  I'm always predicting horrible things are going to happen, with or without data. But I think there were definitely some clues on the internet that Trump should have been taken more seriously than other people were taking him.  Sean Illing  What were you seeing exactly?  Seth Stephens-Davidowitz  The first thing was that the level of racism in this country was a lot higher than I had realized. I think a lot of people thought that Trump would be done as soon as he started saying all these racially charged things. I think when you look at this internet data, you see the demand for this type of material.  I mean, I had even been studying white nationalist sites like Stormfront for a long time, long before most people knew about it, and still I was shocked by how widespread the appeal of these sites were.  Sean Illing  This is what we should’ve been paying attention to, not these outdated polling methods.  Seth Stephens-Davidowitz  You can't really predict using surveys who's going to turn out in an election because everybody says they're going to vote, nobody wants to admit that they have no intention of voting. But you can predict who's going to vote based on their Google searches. People search how to vote, or where to vote, or polling places weeks before an election and that predicts that turnout will be high.  In this election, you saw very, very clearly in the data that there was a huge decrease in these searches in cities with enormous African-American populations, for example. It was very clear in the Google search data that black turnout was going to be way down in 2016, and that was one of the reasons Clinton did so much worse than the polls predicted.  Sean Illing  The political utility of this data is obvious, but it seems like there’s no limit to what we can learn about ourselves. In the book, you call it ""the most important data set ever collected on the human psyche.""  Seth Stephens-Davidowitz  I think the only real competition is Facebook, and I don't think that's as interesting a data set because people are so much less honest on Facebook. People are really, really honest on Google, so they tell Google things that they don't tell anybody else. They search for answers to questions they won’t ask anyone else. I've found this over the past few years: Take any subject area and look at Google searches and you can find something new and interesting and surprising that we didn't know. Whether it's hatred or abortion or child abuse or political views or pregnancy or anxiety or depression. Pretty much every time I turn to Google data, there's something there that is interesting.  Sean Illing  I guess polls are still useful, but search histories are a much better way to get a sense of what people are thinking about controversial or personal subjects.  Seth Stephens-Davidowitz  Yeah, and those are the most interesting things.  Sean Illing  No doubt.  Seth Stephens-Davidowitz  They are also often the most important. One of the studies I talk about in the book is a study of Islamophobia. It's not really Islamophobia, it's like Islamo-rage, or something like that. It’s essentially people with horrifically violent thoughts toward Muslim Americans. People search things like “kill Muslims” or “I hate Muslims” or “Muslims are evil.” These people are basically maniacs and you can actually see minute-by-minute when these searches rise and when these searches fall.  What’s interesting about this is that we’re talking about a relatively small group of maniacs. The average American does not search “kill Muslims” or “I hate Muslims”; it's a small group but it's also an important group because these types of people can create a lot of problems. They are the ones who tend to commit hate crimes or even murder Muslims.  That’s what I mean when I say you can get insights on topics that are truly important.  Sean Illing  Let’s zoom back a bit and get a broader sense of the American psyche as revealed by Google. What do Americans fear the most or worry about the most?  Seth Stephens-Davidowitz  I'd say that one's own body is a pretty big one. If you look at Google AdWords data on bodily insecurity, people who go around looking for ways to lose weight or improve their body, these are almost as popular among men as among women, which is not usually talked about. Twenty percent of searches looking to change one's breasts are from men looking into how to get rid of man boobs. I think male bodily insecurity is not usually talked about but is extremely prevalent.  Sean Illing  That’s interesting.  Seth Stephens-Davidowitz  Yeah, and also not what you’d expect given our cultural biases.  Sean Illing  Have you found that people are basically dishonest about they actually care about? In the age of social media, everyone’s a warrior for justice — you post an article or two, proclaim your outrage or support, and boom you’re an “engaged” person. But that’s not real activism and it doesn’t require any real commitment.  Seth Stephens-Davidowitz  It’s a good question. I’ve explored this is in some of my Trump-related research. I think a lot of people exaggerate the extent to which they're anxious about Trump. It's kind of a game that people play. If you look at what really keeps people up at night, what really wakes them up at 3:00 am in a cold sweat, it tends to be economic concerns or health paranoia or legal fears — basically selfish concerns. But I think there's something a little bit unpleasant about that fact.  People like to say that they're anxious about more global concerns about Trump and what he might do to the world, rather than more selfish concerns about one's own economics or health or legal problems. I think people exaggerate. There's a lot of lying about what we actually care about and what actually moves us and what actually makes us sad, what actually makes us anxious.  Sean Illing  What’s the most shocking finding of your research?  Seth Stephens-Davidowitz  I'm pretty convinced that the United States has a self-induced abortion crisis right now based on the volume of search inquiries. I was blown away by how frequently people are searching for ways to do abortions themselves now. These searches are concentrated in parts of the country where it's hard to get an abortion and they rose substantially when it became harder to get an abortion. They're also, I calculate, missing pregnancies in these states that aren't showing up in either abortion or birth rates.  That's pretty disturbing and I think isn't really being talked about. But I think, based on the data, it's clearly going on.  Sean Illing  That’s appalling if it’s true. Give me some good news. Have you discovered anything pleasant?  Seth Stephens-Davidowitz  I think it’s refreshing to learn that we’re not alone in our anxieties or insecurities or desires. Alcoholics Anonymous has this phrase, don't compare your insides to other people's outsides. But that's hard because we don't see other people's insides, but I think with this search data, we actually, for the first time, do see other people's insides, and it shows that we should be easier on ourselves.  Sean Illing  Do you think we should spend less time online?  Seth Stephens-Davidowitz  Well, I want people to spend a lot of time online so that the data gets better and I can do more research.

Mr. Kim made his comments on Saturday at a meeting of the Central Committee of his ruling Workers’ Party, the official Korean Central News Agency reported on Sunday. He also reconfirmed his policy of simultaneously seeking progress in his nuclear weapons program and pushing for economic growth in the face of expanding international sanctions.  The remarks indicated that Mr. Kim had no intention of retreating under American pressure even as South Korean officials and analysts worry that the North will conduct a major weapons test to observe the anniversary on Tuesday of the founding of the Workers’ Party.  North Korea’s nuclear weapons are a “powerful deterrent firmly safeguarding the peace and security in the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia,” Mr. Kim was quoted as saying, citing “protracted nuclear threats of the U.S. imperialists.”",13.0,13.0

Corey’s brave admission of his experiences in Hollywood should have been treated as a public service announcement for parents who had child actors working in Hollywood, as he was giving them a “heads up” to take the extra steps to protect them. Instead, he was shamed…  Feldman appeared in a 2103 episode of The View where Barbara Walters and Star Jones went out of their way to discredit and shut him up.  “I’m saying there are people that were the people that did this to both me and Corey [Haim] that are still working. They’re still out there, and that are some of the richest most powerful people in this business. Walters tried to interupt, but Feldman continued, “And they do not want me saying what I am saying right now.”    Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?

They want me dead!”  Star Jones quickly jumped in to try to shut Feldman up so he doesn’t scare parents who want their kids in the industry.  Feldman clarified, that he’s just warning parents to “be careful what you wish for. Don’t go into it with naivety.” Instead of considering Feldman’s warning, that may be of interest to parents who have children in the industry, Walters interrupted him to admonish him, “You’re damaging an entire industry!”  Feldman apologized, “I’m sorry.”  After several years of being shamed by his peers and high-profile women in the industry like Barbara Walters, child actor Corey Feldman may finally find someone who will finally take him seriously, now that Harvey Weinstein has been exposed.  Cernovich – The recent exposure of serial sexual predator and Hollywood Democrat kingpin Harvey Weinstein raises, even more, questions than it answers.  In a now famous photo, Weinstein can be seen grabbing young actress Emma Watson in a compromising position.  While the public controversy currently centers around Weinstein’s sexual abuse of power over young women, the question remains – how young were Weinstein’s victims?  Former child actor Corey Feldman has publicly stated that “I was molested and passed around,” while discussing how in Hollywood adult males in the industry would pass young stars “back and forth to each other.” Feldman revealed that his co-star Corey Haim was raped at 11-years-old.  Actor Elijah Wood confirmed Feldman’s claims in May 2016, describing Hollywood as a den of “vipers” in an interview, and saying “If you can imagine it, it’s probably happened.”  Wood said he was protected from abuse by his mother, who didn’t let him go to Hollywood parties, but he said other young child actors were regularly “preyed upon” by those in power.  Wood also compared Hollywood’s sexual predators with known pedophile and English TV personality Jimmy Savile.“You all grew up with Savile,” Wood said. “Jesus, it must have been devastating. Clearly something major was going on in Hollywood. It was all organized.”  X-Men director Bryan Singer is among those publicly accused of sexual abuse of young boys in Hollywood.",6.0,9.0
208,1245,9,22,2017,2017-09-22,Associated Press News,"In new setback, Uber to lose license to work in London","In new setback, Uber to lose license to work in London  FILE - This Wednesday, June 21, 2017, file photo shows the building that houses the headquarters of Uber, in San Francisco. Transport for London says it won't renew a license for Uber to operate in the British capital. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File)  LONDON (AP) — Uber will lose its license to operate in London because it may be endangering public safety and security, the local regulator said Friday, in a severe blow to a company already facing big questions over its corporate culture.  The company, which has been beset by a litany of scandals over its management style — from accusations of sexism to the illegal use of software to trick regulators — was told it was not “fit and proper” to keep operating in London, where it has 3.5 million passengers and 40,000 drivers.  The regulator, Transport for London, said it “considers that Uber’s approach and conduct demonstrate a lack of corporate responsibility in relation to a number of issues which have potential public safety and security implications.”  It cited instances in which Uber failed to report serious criminal offences as well as its penchant to deceive regulators in its decision to not renew its license when it expires on Sept. 30. Uber said it will appeal, during which time it can continue operating.  The decision startled many — even though the ride-hailing business has many critics. The city’s black-cab drivers — who spend years learning the city streets to pass the famed “Knowledge” test — objected to the interlopers who undercut their business. Unions objected to the company’s treatment of its workforce.  In a city where the Labour Party is in the majority, many of these issues — particularly in terms of its treatment of employees — would have resonated with the opposition party’s voters. Labour Mayor Sadiq Khan was quick to endorse the decision of an agency he supervises.  “It’s a technical decision that picks up the spirit of the age,” said Tony Travers, an expert on local government at the London School of Economics.  Uber had been warned. Earlier this year, Transport for London renewed its license on a limited basis, giving it six months to address concerns.  Khan said that any operator of taxi services in the city “needs to play by the rules.”  “Providing an innovative service must not be at the expense of customer safety and security,” he said. “I fully support TfL’s decision — it would be wrong if TfL continued to license Uber if there is any way that this could pose a threat to Londoners’ safety and security.”  For its part, Uber accused the city of caving in to special interests “who want to restrict consumer choice.” It issued a statement to its users, starting an online petition to reverse the decision that had 375,000 signatures late Friday. Uber said the ban would show that London is closed to innovative companies.  Uber’s new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, in a note to employees obtained by The Associated Press, wrote that he disagreed with the decision but it was based on past behavior.  “The truth is that there is a high cost to a bad reputation,” he wrote. “It really matters what people think of us, especially in a global business like ours.”  If its ban is upheld, Uber will have to show that it is changing in order to get back into the lucrative London market, said Jan Dawson, chief analysts for Jackdaw Research in California.  “The fact that Uber is so mature and broadly used in London means it’s very unlikely that it will be permanently banned there - the political fallout would just be too great.”  Uber drivers like James Farrar, the chairman of the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain’s United Private Hire Drivers branch, wondered how they would pay their bills.  “This is a devastating blow,” he said, noting that many people now “face losing their job and being saddled with unmanageable vehicle-related debt.”  Uber, founded in 2010 in San Francisco, has often faced opposition as it expanded. Taxi drivers complain that Uber drivers don’t have to comply with the same licensing standards, giving the ride-hailing service an unfair advantage and placing the public at risk.  The company, which provides a smartphone application that connects passengers with drivers who work as independent contractors, argues it isn’t a traditional transportation company.  Police in London accused Uber last month of not reporting a sexual assault by a driver on a passenger, allowing the driver to strike again. Metropolitan Police Inspector Neil Billany suggested in a letter that the company was putting concerns for its reputation over public safety.  At the time, Uber said it was surprised by the letter and that it had a good working relationship with the police.  But the company has been dogged by questions on its workplace culture. In July, former CEO Travis Kalanick resigned following criticism of his management style. Some 20 people, including some managers, were fired in June amid allegations of sexual harassment and bullying.  Its aggressive corporate culture has resulted in litigation around the world. John Colley, a strategy professor at Warwick Business School, said poor values ultimately bring companies down. Uber is now largely banned from France, Spain and Belgium, and it is facing litigation and investigations around the world, he said.  “There is a very long list of businesses who have suffered for failing to uphold the level of values necessary,” Colley said. “Until Uber gets this message then it will suffer lost trade as a result of its deteriorating reputation.”  In the meantime, many Uber users could be left by the side of the road. More traditional services, like the black cabs or private-hire cars, are more expensive.  Restaurant worker Rio Kato cited the company’s cheaper rates as the reason for using Uber.  “For me it is bad news, because I work at the restaurant — a Japanese restaurant — and it finishes very late,” Kato said. “And sometimes there is no bus service, no Underground (metro), so sometimes I use Uber. If it is finished, I have a problem.”  __  Tom Krisher in Detroit contributed to this story.",4.0,8.0

Trump's recent threat to decertify the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, “makes us look foolish and small and plays right into Iranian hands,” Clinton said last week.  ""That is bad not just on the merits for this particular situation, but it sends a message across the globe that America's word is not good,"" said Clinton, who spoke in advance of Trump's announcement Friday that he wants Congress and the other nations that negotiated the deal to toughen the requirements for Iran.  ""This particular president is, I think, upending the kind of trust and credibility of the United States' position and negotiation that is imperative to maintain.""  ""This particular president is, I think, upending the kind of trust and credibility of the United States' position and negotiation that is imperative to maintain."" — Hillary Clinton  For his part, Trump says that Clinton, as secretary of state under former President Barack Obama, helped negotiate a “terrible” deal with Iran.  Getting tough on Iran is the right approach, the president said.  “We will not continue down a path whose predictable conclusion is more violence, more terror and the very real threat of Iran’s nuclear breakout,” Trump said Friday, according to the Washington Times. “Iran is not living up to the spirit of the deal.”  Clinton also denounced Trump's bellicose language toward North Korea, saying his verbal aggression has rattled U.S. allies.  ""We will now have an arms race — a nuclear arms race in East Asia,"" Clinton predicted. ""We will have the Japanese, who understandably are worried with missiles flying over them as the North Koreans have done, that they can't count on America.""  Clinton stressed that a diplomatic solution was preferred, and suggested the inflammatory rhetoric played into Kim Jung Un's hands. She bemoaned Trump's public undercutting of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson when he tweeted ""Save your energy, Rex"" after the nation's top diplomat had suggested negotiations.  “Diplomacy, preventing war, creating some deterrents is slow, hard-going, difficult work,” said Clinton, who declined to answer when asked whether Tillerson should resign. ""And you can't have impulsive people or ideological people who basically say, 'Well, we're done with you.'""  Trump on Sept. 21 signed an executive order calling for a new round of economic sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.  The president said the actions were aimed at “a complete denuclearization of North Korea,” the Washington Times reported.  “North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile development is a grave threat to peace and security in our world,” Trump said. “It is unacceptable that others financially support this criminal rogue regime.”  Clinton, who recently released a book that recounts her election defeat to Trump, has been an aggressive critic of the president.  In an interview with Britain’s BBC on Friday, Clinton called Trump a “sexual assaulter.”  Clinton made the comments when asked about the allegations of sexual assault made against Democratic mega-donor and Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.  “This kind of behavior cannot be tolerated anywhere, whether it's in entertainment, politics,” Clinton said. “After all, we have someone admitting to being a sexual assaulter in the Oval Office.”  In the same interview, Clinton referred to the sexual transgressions of her husband – former President Bill Clinton – as being “clearly in the past,” Fox News reported.  Clinton’s comments on Iran and North Korea were scheduled to air Sunday on CNN. The White House did not immediately return a request to respond to her remarks.

104,607,9,9,2017,2017-09-09,Vox,Seattle should make a pitch to be Amazon’s 2nd headquarters,"Amazon’s announcement that it wants to essentially duplicate its massive home office presence by constructing a second corporate headquarters in North America set off an irresistible frenzy of speculation. And from the company’s point of view, the best part is that it will also set off an irresistible race to the bottom as cities compete to shower subsidies on the company in hopes of luring the proposed 50,000 jobs spread across 8 million square feet of offices at an average compensation of $100,000 a piece.  But one city is weirdly missing from the speculation: Seattle.  Seattle checks all the boxes. It’s a large, amenity-rich city whose metro area population is well over 1 million. It’s also an unusually well-educated city, with plentiful college graduates and a local business culture rich with experience in both engineering and retail with companies like Microsoft, Starbucks, and (historically) Boeing headquartered there. Its airport, though modest in size, serves all the major international business destinations — places like London, Tokyo, Beijing, Shanghai, Frankfurt, Seoul, Dubai, Taipei, Paris, Toronto, and Shenzhen.  There’s a thriving cultural scene, Washington State’s public schools are relatively high performing, and the kind of young, affluent, educated workers Amazon is looking to attract will appreciate the opportunity to live in a culturally progressive state that also doesn’t levy an income tax.  Seattle isn’t thought of as one of America’s great mass transit cities, but it is investing heavily in expansion of its offerings and the situation is set to continue improving.  Perhaps best of all, Seattle is where Amazon’s headquarters is already located. That will spare executives the need to fly to some satellite headquarters in another city, facilitate collaboration between rank-and-file colleagues across the company, and avoid the linguistic absurdity of a company claiming to have two different HQs.  Seattle can grow  This, of course, is exactly the problem.  Seattleites, reflecting a paucity of ambition that has become endemic to coastal American cities, have convinced themselves that their city is somehow tapped out of potential growth. It’s choking on dastardly Amazon’s determination to lease office space and employ people who, in turn, demand houses and other local services. This thinking has, apparently, penetrated into the upper ranks of the company itself which is now seeking a second home in which to grow and expand.  But this sense that Seattle is already experiencing run-amok growth and bursting at the seams deserves some scrutiny and historical perspective.  In 1980, Seattle had about 493,846 residents. By 2016 it had added about 210,00 people and reached an estimated population of 704,352. That’s a reasonably fast-growing city, but consider that back in 1980 there were only 385,164 people in Fort Worth and today there are 854,113. Back when Detroit was an up-and-coming high tech city it went from 465,766 residents to 993,678 in just 10 years and then added 750,000 more people in the next 20 years after that.  Amazon could keep growing with Seattle if Seattle grew faster, and Seattle could grow faster if it wanted to. And it ought to want to.  Let them build it and they will come  The fundamental problem Seattle is facing is that the city, county, and state governments are trying to funnel demand for growth into a comparatively tiny patch of the city. Downtown and select other areas zoned for high rises are, in fact, seeing a huge boom in high rise construction.  But (depending on exactly how you count) somewhere between 57 and 65 percent of the city’s land area is zoned exclusively for single-family homes. The recent devastating flooding in the famously zoning-free city of Houston has sparked a mini-renaissance of enthusiasm for restrictive land use planning. But as Richard Kahlenberg wrote in August, the actual history of single-family zoning in the United States has nothing to do with flood control and everything to do with racial segregation. Houston itself, meanwhile, through parking requirements, largely manages to recreate many of the pathologies of single-family zoning.  There’s nothing wrong, of course, with owning a single-family home if you have the means and desire to do so. The United States is a relatively land-rich country in the scheme of things, so there’s no reason the majority of people shouldn’t live in single-family homes. But land is almost by definition not plentiful in urban cores, and it’s absurd for the majority of the land in a central city to be set aside exclusively for suburban-style housing.  To accommodate growth, Seattle needs what growing cities have traditionally had — not just luxury high-rises on a narrow swathe of land, but the ability to sprinkle duplexes, triplexes, garden apartments, and rowhouses throughout the city and for strip malls and low-rise retail corridors to grow and evolve into secondary business districts. Right now, the number three city of the West Coast has considerably less population density than Boston, Philadelphia, DC, or even Providence, Rhode Island.  But nor should all the weight be put on the city proper. In Seattle, like in all American cities, the majority of the population and the vast majority of the land is in the suburbs. But King County, which contains the city itself, has only about a quarter the population density of Nassau County in the New York suburbs. Some of this stems from a laudable desire to preserve unspoiled natural landscapes. But much of it is simply large-lot zoning, a desperately underbaked commuter rail system, and a lack of ambition. Mercer Island, for example, isn’t a wilderness preserve — it’s a rich snob-zoning enclave where most of the land is set aside for lots of at least 8,000 square feet.  Make Greater Seattle even Greater  The solution to Amazon’s problem of wanting, over the years, to hire a bunch more people to work at its headquarters is obvious — keep expanding its Seattle headquarters.  And the solution to the Seattle area’s “problem” of being home to too many successful companies that are adding high-paid employees too quickly is almost comically simple — take advantage of the situation.  The City of Seattle has already moved aggressively to take advantage of the booming economy by establishing a nation-leading minimum wage to try to ensure that prosperity is broadly spread. The next step is for the city, state, and county government to come together and present an ambition plan for growth. Instead of the lavish tax subsidies other cities will offer, they should pitch the basic convenience of staying put and promise the investments and policy changes that Greater Seattle needs to grow alongside Amazon. That means even bolder investments in the city’s bus and light rail network, upgrading Sounder Commuter Rail to something resembling a viable rail link to Tacoma, and rezoning for growth.  The city should accept its own expert committee’s 2015 proposal to end single-family zoning, and the state and county should step up with measures to increase housing density throughout the area’s already-developed stretches of suburb.  Amazon might, of course, end up saying no anyway. Perhaps the lure of tax credits offered by Chicago, Philadelphia, or Atlanta will be too much to turn down. Perhaps Jeff Bezos just wants to prove he can make it in the Big Apple or exercise political influence in Washington. Maybe America’s anti-immigrant turn makes the idea of a Toronto-based pipeline to international talent irresistible. In life, you win some and you lose some.  But it would be absurd for Seattle to simply give up and accept the premise that one of the country’s most forward-thinking and dynamic cities is fated to play second-fiddle to Fort Worth in population growth and force its most successful company to seek its fortunes elsewhere. The whole point of the headquarters is that you only have one, and Seattle should pitch to keep it that way.",2.0,2.0

Acaba was barely outside an hour when he had to replace one of his safety tethers. Spacewalking astronauts always have more than one of these crucial lifelines in case one breaks. They also wear a jetpack in case all tethers fail and they need to fly back to the space station. (NASA via AP)  CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — A spacewalking astronaut successfully replaced a blurry camera outside the International Space Station on Friday, but had to contend with a balky jetpack and a frayed safety tether.  Both jetpacks and safety ties are crucial for saving a flyaway astronaut.  NASA said Joe Acaba was always securely attached to the orbiting outpost and never in any danger during the nearly seven-hour spacewalk.  But one of his tethers had to be replaced shortly after he and station commander Randy Bresnik floated outside. Mission Control noticed the red lifeline was frayed and worn. Bresnik went back to the air lock to get Acaba a spare.  Then five hours into the spacewalk, Mission Control saw that the right handle on Acaba’s emergency jetpack was popped open — again. Bresnik once more went to his crewmate’s assistance, even offering some tape to keep it down.  After consulting for several minutes in Houston, flight controllers declared the jetpack unreliable and ordered Acaba back inside, once he was done greasing the new robot arm on the space station’s big robot arm. He finished the lube job, then headed in.  Bresnik acknowledged things didn’t go as planned, “with all the stuff that happened today and the challenges we had.” But he thanked everyone for their hard work and diligence.  In the end, only a couple minor chores were left undone.  “Great work today,” Mission Control radioed as the spacewalk came to a close.  It was the third spacewalk in two weeks for U.S. astronauts. Bresnik went out on all three; he was accompanied by Mark Vande Hei to install the new robotic hand on Oct. 5 and lubricate it on Oct. 10.  Each spacewalker wears a jetpack for use in an emergency. It’s available in case an astronaut’s multiple tethers fail and allows the spacewalker to fly back to the station. It’s been tested by orbiting astronauts — years ago — but never called into urgent action.  Earlier, Acaba provided necessary focus to the space station’s robot arm.  He unbolted a blurry camera from the new robotic hand installed two weeks ago. He then popped in a spare, which flight controllers quickly tested from Houston. The replacement provided crisp, clear views.  Sharp focus is essential when the space station’s robot hand grabs an arriving supply ship and anchors it. The next delivery is a few weeks away, prompting the quick camera swap-out.  Orbital ATK, one of NASA’s commercial shippers, plans to launch a cargo ship from Virginia on Nov. 11.  Acaba and the station’s commander, Randy Bresnik, were supposed to go spacewalking earlier this week. But NASA needed extra time to add the camera repair to their chores.  Friday’s spacewalk — expected to be the last one for the year — also saw the astronauts installing a high-definition camera, replacing a fuse and removing thermal insulation from spare electronics. Early next year, astronauts will replace the hand on the opposite side of the 58-foot robot arm, Canada’s main contribution to the space station. The original latching mechanisms are showing wear and tear since the arm’s launch in 2001.  The 250-mile-high complex is currently home to three Americans, two Russians and one Italian.  A one-time high school and middle school teacher, Acaba is the first astronaut of Puerto Rican heritage; his parents were born there. He ventured out on Friday’s spacewalk as the station soared above the hurricane-ravaged island, where much of his extended family lives.  “There’s a whole line of people looking up and smiling today as you get ready to head out the door,” Bresnik told him.",5.0,9.0

Ms. Yellen has charted a steady course for monetary policy in the coming years: gradual increases in interest rates and a gradual reduction in the Fed’s bond holdings. But some of the candidates Mr. Trump is considering, including Mr. Warsh and Mr. Taylor, have argued that the Fed should raise rates and reverse its postcrisis buildup of bonds more quickly.  The Fed chairman also plays a leading role in financial regulation and will have to navigate calls by Republican leaders, including Mr. Trump, to roll back some of the rules put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. Ms. Yellen was a principal architect of those more stringent regulations and has said the financial system is much stronger as a result. Mr. Trump has criticized many of the banking rules, saying they are excessive and impeding economic growth. The candidates to replace Ms. Yellen all share those concerns to varying degrees.  Given the high stakes, Mr. Trump’s decision has become a source of intrigue in political and economic circles this year. There is also a growing sense of urgency: Both Ms. Yellen and her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke, were nominated in October, leaving ample time for the Senate to hold confirmation hearings. Mr. Trump has said he does not plan to make a decision until later in the year, leaving little time for the Senate to act given the tight calendar. Aides say he is not yet focused on the search. Additional candidates could ultimately be considered.  The administration officials and the other person with knowledge of the search requested anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the job in question. A White House spokeswoman had no immediate comment, and Mr. Cohn, Mr. Taylor and Mr. Warsh did not respond to requests for comment. A Fed spokeswoman said Ms. Yellen and Mr. Powell declined to comment.  The next Fed chairman is likely to begin the four-year term in an atmosphere of relative tranquillity during one of the longest economic expansions in American history. But the Fed is confronting a number of difficult issues. One question is whether it can do more to increase economic growth. Another is whether the Fed will be ready for the next economic downturn.",14.0,17.0

The EU on Monday Nov. 13, 2017 banned arms sales to Venezuela and set up a system to slap asset freezes and travel restrictions on Venezuelan officials as it seeks to ramp up pressure on President Nicolas Maduro. The move was decided by EU foreign ministers at talks in Brussels. (AP Photo/Ariana Cubillos, File)  CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Foreign investors walked a red carpet at a state palace Monday eager to hear strategies for reorganizing Venezuela’s billions in debt, but they left minutes later having learned no concrete plans to address the country’s financial crisis.  Vice President Tareck El Aissami, who headed the talks, used much of his time to rail against U.S. President Donald Trump and foreign lenders for leading what the government calls an “economic war” against this oil-rich nation.  But he also tried to assure creditors that debts will continue to be paid, echoing statements by President Nicolas Maduro that Venezuela has made more than $70 billion in debt payments since 2013.  “The state has fully honored its national and international commitments, especially with regard to external debt service,” El Aissami said in a televised broadcast. “Even with great sacrifice, we have paid every penny of our debt service.”  Those few investors who bothered to show up had few expectations for the meeting, which from the start was clouded in confusion.  Maduro invited investors to Caracas a little more than a week ago while announcing his goal of renegotiating a foreign debt that he said has become impossible to repay because of a U.S.-led financial “blockade” of the socialist-run country.  As Venezuela spent heavily on social programs under the late President Hugo Chavez, a time when global oil prices soared, its debt skyrocketed to over $120 billion, about half of which is in the form of dollar-denominated bonds. The drop in crude prices has ravaged the country that sits atop the world’s largest oil reserves, leading to widespread shortages amid triple-digit inflation.  Strained relations between Venezuela and the United States are compounding the situation.  The Trump administration has sanctioned a growing list of Venezuelan officials, including the government’s top two debt negotiators, Economy Minister Simon Zerpa and El Aissami. The vice president is accused of being a major drug trafficker.  Washington has also barred U.S. companies from lending new money to Venezuela because of human rights abuses committed during months of anti-government protests and Maduro’s efforts to squash the opposition.  But in a sign the Trump administration might be willing to soften its stance, the Treasury Department said last week that it would consider allowing Americans to deal in new debt if any restructuring plan was backed by Venezuela’s opposition-controlled congress, whose authority has been steadfastly ignored by Maduro’s government.  Russ Dallen, managing partner of Caracas Capital Markets, said several U.S. investors he represents told him they wouldn’t bother attending. One said he couldn’t get a visa on such short notice and another reported planning to send an intern, citing the lack of information.  “You’d think they’d put it on the table and let you study it if there was some kind of proposal,” Dallen said. “There’s nothing. Just crickets.”  Also Monday, at an informal meeting to discuss Venezuela at the U.N. Security Council, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley called Venezuela “an increasingly violent narco-state” that threatens the world.  Venezuela’s U.N. ambassador, Rafael Ramirez, responded by denouncing the session.  “This is a hostile act from the United States and an interference that violates the sovereignty principles of a country that is a member of the United Nations,” he told reporters.  In Brussels earlier in the day, the European Union banned arms sales to Venezuela and set up a system to slap asset freezes and travel restrictions on Venezuelan officials as it seeks to ramp up pressure on Maduro. The weapons ban would stop sales of military equipment that could be used for repression or surveillance of Venezuelans.",1.0,4.0

Time for everyone else to catch up.,"Trump wants credit for economic progress, but the continued recovery has little to do with him  President Donald Trump has been promoting record high valuations on the Dow Jones industrial average as proof of his supposed economic accomplishments and has attacked news outlets for not covering the stock market gains and steady job creation during the first six months of his presidency. In response to both his boasts and his frequent criticism, journalists have been quick to point out that Trump deserves little credit for positive economic trends that predate his administration given his lack of substantive policy accomplishments while in office.  Trump promotes jobs report, stock market gains as proof of his success  Trump takes credit for steady job creation, business confidence, and record stock market values. In the past week, President Donald Trump has tweeted praise for “record levels” of American business enthusiasm and “all-time” high stock market valuations while bemoaning that “mainstream media seldom mentions” the recent financial surge. On August 4, Trump boasted about the “Excellent Jobs Numbers” released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) while claiming that his work as a job creator had “only just begun”:  Business is looking better than ever with business enthusiasm at record levels.

On the August 3 edition of MSNBC’s Morning Joe, analyst Steve Rattner pointed out that stock market increases during Trump’s first six months in office actually underperformed stock market growth during Obama’s first six months in office. Further undermining Trump’s boasts, Rattner added that in reality, “the stock market is for wealthy people” and not a good proxy for broad economic gains, which are better reflected by monthly job growth figures that are lagging slightly behind the pace set in 2016. Rattner also reminded viewers that the president had no real reason to brag about his economic record because the Trump administration has had “zero impact” on the economy in terms of policies enacted.

On the August 3 edition of CNN’s Early Start, co-host Alison Kosik called Trump the stock markets’ “cheerleader-in-chief,” but she noted that while the rally at the start of Trump’s administration was prompted by the president’s calls for tax reform, Trump’s agenda has since fallen apart and the market is instead looking toward corporate earnings. In fact, Kosik reported it was Apple’s earnings report on August 2 that surged its stock and pushed the Dow Jones industrial average above 22,000 points for the first time ever -- not Trump. [CNN, Early Start, 8/3/17]  MSNBC’s Ali Velshi: Trump’s claims on the economy are ""nonsensical"" and ""disingenuous.""

Benen reported that the stock market had tripled under the last president, and he cautioned Trump that stocks are not a “presidential report card,” noting that gains can just as easily reverse regardless of the president’s policy agenda. Benen also questioned whether Trump would take ownership of such a market correction in the same way he has tried to take credit for the recent expansion (emphasis original):  1. The stock market is not a presidential report card. Though Trump administration officials have explicitly argued otherwise, to see the markets as a barometer of economic health is a mistake. Sometimes the markets go up during tough economic times, sometimes they go down during good economic times. 2. Live by Wall Street, die by Wall Street. Will Trump World continue to see the markets as the only metric that matters if there’s a correction? Somehow, I doubt it. 3. Obama. Under Trump’s predecessor, the markets nearly tripled in value. If Wall Street performance is a measure of a president’s economic successes, Trump must see Barack Obama as a legendary genius. 4. We still remember Trump’s pre-election rhetoric. As recently as last year, Candidate Trump said the markets were inflated, stuck in a “bubble,” and poised to crash. Whatever happened to those concerns? 5. Roosters like taking credit for the sunrise, but that doesn’t make it so. Yes, the markets have steadily gained this year, just as they’ve steadily gained in recent years. Is there any reason to believe this is a reflection of Trump’s policies? Given that the president hasn’t actually done anything in terms of economic policy, it’s a stretch. [MSNBC.com, 8/2/17]  CNN: Trump should take note that the stock market has hit an “all-time high in 30 of the last 54 months.” An August 2 article on CNN.com reported that Trump should take note that stocks have repeatedly hit new all-time highs over the last several years. CNN reported that the while the Dow Jones did hit 22,000 on August 2 -- a new record -- the same stock index had set record highs in 30 of the last 54 months. [CNN.com, 8/2/17]  Politico: Stock performance has little to do with the economy. In an August 2 Politico article titled “Trump is fooling himself with the Dow,” Assistant Editor Danny Vinik reported that economists have found a weak connection at best between stock market performance and economic growth. Vinik continued that if Trump wanted to better assist his voters he should focus on labor participation and productivity growth:  The Dow, of course, isn’t unrelated to the economy. The index of 30 large publicly traded companies is a popular proxy for the health of America’s largest businesses. If the Dow were crashing, it would be a real sign of trouble. But economists have frequently found little relationship between returns on stock investments and real economic growth. For example, a major 2002 study, from three economists, looked at equity returns and per capita gross domestic product growth for 16 nations from 1900 to 2000 and found little evidence that stronger equity returns correlated with stronger long-run economic growth. [Politico, 8/2/17]  Vice: The stock market is just for rich people. On August 2, Vice staff writer Eve Peyser wrote that the stock market overwhelmingly benefits the wealthiest households and mocked Trump for cheering on the stock market because of “something he saw on FOX & Friends.” Peyser pointed out that the wealthiest 10 percent of Americans own 90 percent of investments, and that would mean Trump’s administration is little more than a boon for the big business and the rich:",1.0,1.0

Mrs. May’s long-awaited intervention, during a speech in Florence, Italy, was being watched closely in capitals on the Continent and in London, where members of her cabinet have been fiercely divided over Britain’s tortuous divorce from the bloc. The speech aimed to open the way to serious negotiations on what is commonly known as Brexit, and to a broader and more productive discussion about Britain’s relationship with the bloc.  However, while offering some concessions designed to do that, Mrs. May did not give any fresh insight into the type of ties she ultimately wants Britain to have to the bloc — a question that divides her cabinet and her Conservative, or Tory, Party.  The European Union’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, issued a cautious response, saying in a statement that, “We look forward to the United Kingdom’s negotiators explaining the concrete implications of Prime Minister Theresa May’s speech. Our ambition is to find a rapid agreement on the conditions of the United Kingdom’s orderly withdrawal, as well as on a possible transition period.”",6.0,8.0

Email *  Email      “Pumpkin spice just doesn’t taste as good when you add a shot of racism,” a feminist leader explained as the fall flavor began to pop up in coffee shops around the country. This is a shockingly weird claim, but it shouldn’t be surprising.  In an editorial published last month, we wrote about the Left’s effort to broaden the boundaries of concepts such as white supremacy and racism in a way that impugns the conduct of well-meaning people. Now, a feminist nonprofit is running a campaign to convince festive imbibers of Pumpkin Spice Lattes they’re unknowingly boosting the cause of white supremacy.  The co-founder of UltraViolet issued the “shot of racism” statement Sept. 6. I knew Starbucks had a secret menu, but the baristas must really be keeping these racism shots on the down low.  A social media post from the group informed readers: “That favorite fall drink of yours is funding rent payments to white supremacy.”  Given the severity of the campaign’s language, one may assume profits from sales of Starbucks’ beloved PSLs are being surreptitiously redirected to the Klan or neo-Nazi groups. In fact, UltraViolet’s actual complaint is that a couple of Starbucks’ 24,000 locations happen to be in properties owned by the Trump Organization.  According to UltraViolet’s logic, by patronizing any of Starbucks’ thousands of stores, average consumers of the signature fall beverage are directly boosting the cause of white supremacy. How increased latte profits to the Trump Organization (not even the White House) impact the president’s policies on racial matters is left unclear.  Read more: WE",16.0,21.0

Insurers and other experts who testified before the Senate health committee said such a program could help substantially lower premiums. But states may be able to use innovation waivers to establish such programs themselves. Alaska has already had such a waiver approved by the Trump administration.  The insurers were generally supportive of the plan, and one of the main associations, America’s Health Insurance Plans, came out with a statement in favor of the proposed bill. But some emphasized that the legislation does not fix all of what ails the market. “We’ve stated repeatedly that the individual market is not stable,” said Joseph R. Swedish, the chief executive of Anthem, a large for-profit insurer that offers Blue Cross plans in several states, although he praised lawmakers’ efforts to provide more certainty in 2019.  The deal’s prospects in Congress remain uncertain. Though some senators from each party have endorsed its approach, several Republicans have spoken out against it. In the House, a spokesman for Speaker Paul Ryan said that “the Senate should keep its focus on repeal and replace of Obamacare.”  But even if the deal moves forward quickly, it is unlikely to affect next year’s health plans. Carriers in most states have raised their prices substantially to make up for the canceled federal payments, and there is little time for them to lower them again if the payments are restored. (The draft bill tries to address this problem, by asking states to establish a new rebate program, where carriers who get paid twice would need to pay back the federal government.)  “For 2018, it probably won’t happen in time,” said Timothy Jost, an emeritus professor of law at Washington and Lee University, who monitors health legislation closely. “The carriers are thinking now about 2019, and it’s very important for 2019.”  Insurance plans for each year go on sale during the prior fall, but the process of devising plans and setting prices begins months earlier. This year, many current insurers announced their exits from the 2018 Obamacare markets months ago, some explicitly naming President Trump’s threats about the cost-sharing payments as a reason. Analysts said it was unclear whether the plan might lure reluctant insurers back into the markets, but they said the funding would cause many insurance premiums to fall in 2019.  But the lengthy planning process of insurers means that the proposed bill’s two-year funding cycle could lead to another round of price increases in 2020, if an extension bill isn’t passed far in advance. Many insurers had been hoping that the Alexander-Murray legislation would make the funding permanent.",13.0,13.0
736,2150,10,17,2017,2017-10-17,The New York Times,How Dennis Overbye Makes Space-Time Relatable,"Still, Mr. Overbye’s stories often live where the earthly meets the cosmic. His first book, “Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos,” recounts the birth of cosmology through the personal dramas of its founders and was nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1991. And in 2014, he was named a Pulitzer Prize finalist for his reporting on the race to discover the Higgs boson, which focused on the lives of just a handful of the thousands of scientists swept up in the search for “the God particle.”  Once Mr. Overbye identifies a story, he said, the work is in putting it in terms people can understand. “Metaphors are very important to the way I write,” he said. The results are vivid descriptions that surpass mere translation. Einstein’s epiphany that space-time is distorted by gravity, for instance, renders the universe as “the ultimate sagging mattress,” and elementary particles derive mass from the Higgs boson “the way politicians draw succor from cheers and handshakes at the rope line.”  “I once compared the Milky Way galaxy to a piñata that the Kepler spacecraft had whacked and hundreds or thousands of new planets had fallen out,” Mr. Overbye said.  Sometimes the effect can be rhapsodic. Astronomers on Monday announced the first detection of a kilonova, the collision of hyperdense dead stars thought to be responsible for creating many of the heavier elements in the universe, including gold, silver, platinum and uranium. As Mr. Overbye describes it: “All the atoms in your wedding band, in the pharaoh’s treasures and the bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and still threaten us all, so the story goes, have been formed in cosmic gong shows that reverberated across the heavens.”",5.0,5.0
857,2314,10,20,2017,2017-10-20,Vox,"An Indiana county just halted a lifesaving needle exchange program, citing the Bible","“People will absolutely die as a result.”  That’s how Chris Abert of the Indiana Recovery Alliance described the consequences of an Indiana county’s decision to stop a needle exchange program, which provides clean syringes to drug users in an effort to stop the spread of infectious blood-borne diseases like HIV and hepatitis.  Lawrence County commissioners’ reasoning: morals — and the Bible.  “It was a moral issue with me. I had severe reservations that were going to keep me from approving that motion,” County Commissioner Rodney Fish, who voted against the program, told NBC News. “I did not approach this decision lightly. I gave it a great deal of thought and prayer. My conclusion was that I could not support this program and be true to my principles and my beliefs.”  Before he cast his vote, Fish quoted the Bible — specifically, 2 Chronicles 7. It says, “If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people; if my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.”  The empirical evidence, however, is on the needle exchange programs’ side. Abert said that it’s led to a 50 percent decrease in hepatitis C cases in Lawrence County so far this year. And multiple reviews of the evidence by the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and others have overwhelmingly supported needle exchanges.  Abert also argued that, if anything, the Bible teaches people to help those in need — exactly what a needle exchange program aims to do. “Christians believe their spiritual life is defined by how well they mirror Christ’s work in their daily lives,” he told me.  But that didn’t persuade commissioners, and they voted against the program.  Indiana’s troubled history with needle exchanges  This isn’t the first time needle exchange programs have proven controversial in Indiana.  In 2015, the southeastern part of the state suffered an HIV epidemic linked to the injection use of Opana, a prescription painkiller that’s been widely misused throughout the opioid crisis. Back then, state lawmakers — including then-Gov. Mike Pence — were opposed to a needle exchange program. It was only after the HIV epidemic worsened that Pence finally relented, allowing a needle exchange program in Scott County and later signing a law that lets counties set up needle exchange programs if they prove they have an epidemic.  But some counties have been resistant to the concept. NBC News reported that earlier this year, Madison County also shut down a needle exchange program due to pressure from the local prosecutor and Indiana Attorney General Curtis Hill, who was elected in November and opposes needle exchange programs.  Lawrence County was among the several that got permission for a needle exchange program. But this month, the program was halted pending reapproval from county commissioners. The law requires county approval for the program on an annual basis, even though the needle exchange does not use county or state funding.  On Tuesday, county commissioners voted against the needle exchange program. They heard from some members of the community who were opposed to the program, but Abert said that a drug court judge, academics, and health care providers also testified in favor of it. Ultimately, the commissioners sided with the opposition.  “It came down to morally, they’re breaking the law. I can’t condone that,” County Commissioner Dustin Gabhart said, according to Indiana Public Media. “Yes, it’s a problem. Yes, it needs to be resolved. I could not give them the tools to do it.”  Needle exchanges save lives. Period.  The common argument against needle exchange programs, echoed by Indiana officials, is that they enable drug use by providing people with the tools to use drugs. And, they claim, that may lead to more drug use.  The claims are not borne out by the evidence. A 1998 study from researchers at Johns Hopkins University found needle exchange programs generally reduced the spread of HIV without increasing drug use. A 2004 study from the World Health Organization, which analyzed two decades of evidence, produced similar results. A 2016 review of 15 studies by the CDC did as well.  As one example, the CDC noted that once Washington, DC, was able to implement a needle exchange program, an evaluation “showed a 70 percent decrease in new HIV cases among [injection drug use] and a total of 120 HIV cases averted in two years.”  This is, frankly, not a remotely controversial topic in the research: Needle exchange programs save lives. Many people are going to find ways to use drugs no matter what, and providing them with clean syringes at least eliminates some of the risk tied to that drug use.  Experts also say needle exchange sites can be crucial for linking people to addiction treatment. For an upcoming story, John Brooklyn, an addiction doctor in Vermont, told me that these programs can be critical for “meeting people where they are.” The idea is simple: Addiction treatment staff can drop by these needle exchange programs and offer their services. People won’t always take up the suggestion, but it helps reinforce that treatment is around and available.  Indiana’s story, though, shows the one thing holding back these successful public health programs: stigma that treats addiction as a moral failure instead of a medical issue.  So despite the public health evidence, officials will often cite moral objections to needle exchange programs. And more people will die as a result.",9.0,9.0
1569,3242,11,9,2017,2017-11-09,Vox,A new study compared opioids and over-the-counter painkillers in ERs. Opioids didn’t do so well.,"For years, doctors have deployed opioids in emergency room settings as a standard response to severe acute pain. A new study, however, is questioning that practice in some cases.  The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association this month by researchers at Albany Medical College and Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, looked at four alternative approaches to acute pain in an emergency department: three treatments with opioids and one with over-the-counter, non-opioid painkillers. The researchers concluded that “there were no statistically significant or clinically important differences in pain reduction at 2 hours” between the opioid treatments and the non-opioid variant.  In other words, the kind of pain studied — acute shoulder, arm, hip, or leg pain in an emergency room setting — was treated equally well with non-opioids as it was with opioids. That’s promising, given that opioids generally carry greater risks in terms of addiction, misuse, and overdose — as the nation’s opioid epidemic has shown.  Now, the study does not say that opioids have no place in pain care. Andrew Chang, the lead author of the study, told me he’s worried that in the response to the opioid crisis, we may overcorrect and limit opioids too much. “I do also worry that we might be swinging the pendulum too far in the other direction,” he wrote in an email, “and I hope we don’t end up creating arbitrary regulatory restrictions that prevent patients who appropriately need opioids from receiving opioids.”  But his research demonstrates that it may be possible to cut back on the amount of opioids used in at least some acute pain care settings without inflicting harm. As policymakers and health care providers respond to the opioid epidemic, that’s good to know.  What the study found  The study looked at more than 400 patients going to the Montefiore Medical Center in Bronx, New York, for acute extremity pain from bone fractures, dislocated shoulders, sprained ankles, and other injuries or conditions.  The patients were then randomly divided into four groups, with each group getting a different combination of drugs to treat their pain. The non-opioid group got 400 mg of ibuprofen and 1,000 mg of acetaminophen, which are often sold over the counter as Advil and Tylenol, respectively. The opioid groups got 5 mg of oxycodone and 325 mg of acetaminophen, 5 mg of hydrocodone and 300 mg of acetaminophen, or 30 mg of codeine and 300 mg of acetaminophen.  On a scale of zero to 10, the patients in the study reported, on average, an initial pain score of 8.7, with no significant differences between the groups. One and two hours later, they reported their pain scores after getting their assigned medication.  Across all groups, patients’ pain scores fell over the two hours: by 4.3 in the ibuprofen and acetaminophen group, 4.4 in the oxycodone and acetaminophen group, 3.5 in the hydrocodone and acetaminophen group, and 3.9 in the codeine and acetaminophen group. The reductions were statistically equivalent across all four groups.  “Some (not all) physicians reflexively think fractures require opioids, but this study lends evidence that opioids are not always necessary even in the presence of fractures,” Chang told me, cautioning that there are likely exceptions for worse and more complicated injuries.  The study was a randomized clinical trial, which is considered the gold standard for medical research. When I asked Stanford drug policy expert Keith Humphreys, who was not involved in the research, what he thought of it, he said that it was a “[g]ood study in a good journal.”  There were limitations in the study. For one, the findings only apply to this specific emergency room setting and over two hours. The researchers also explicitly excluded chronic conditions, such as sickle cell disease, because they wanted to focus on acute pain. More research will be needed to see not just if the study’s findings can be replicated, but also if they apply to other settings, other conditions, or over greater periods of time.  Another big caveat: Even if future studies produce similar findings, that does not mean that everyone will be able to use non-opioids for acute pain. As Chang told me, “[I]t’s important to recognize that the lack of a difference in our study among the four groups is on average, and that any individual patient might receive better pain relief with a particular analgesic.” In short, just because something might be generally true does not mean it can apply to every single individual.  For example, patients who require more pain relief may benefit from a higher dose of opioids than what was provided in the study. Chang’s study used a fairly high dose of ibuprofen and acetaminophen; anything higher could risk serious health problems, since ibuprofen can be hard on the kidneys, among other side effects. But the doses used in the opioid groups, while common in ER settings, weren’t close to the maximum safe dose, so they could be scaled up with fewer potential health risks than the ibuprofen-acetaminophen combination.  Kidney donors or people with kidney disease would also likely benefit more from the opioids. Any loss in kidney function makes ibuprofen inadvisable, so it might be better for these types of patients to get opioids regardless of what the study found.  And for patients in end-of-life care, it’s possible that opioids are simply better because the risk of addiction is, frankly, not a very big concern for someone who is terminally ill. So it might be better to use what can be more easily scaled up to higher doses.  Other caveats may apply, depending on the kinds of conditions and circumstances that a patient is going to the hospital with.  The study also did not measure adverse effects. The researchers pointed to another that did: A “similar [emergency department]-based study lasting 90 minutes had an incidence of adverse events of 1.6% in the codeine group, 3.3% in the nonopioid group, and 16.9% in the oxycodone group, with lightheadedness accounting for 70% of adverse events in the oxycodone group.” But since that study used higher doses for opioids than Chang’s research, the findings aren’t comparable to what Chang and his colleagues found.  So the study isn’t the final word. Still, it gives promising insight in a crucial area of public health.  We can pull back on opioids without doing harm  This research falls under the shadow of the opioid epidemic. The current overdose crisis has over time changed to involve all kinds of opioids — painkillers, heroin, and fentanyl. But it originally began with the overprescription of opioid painkillers, which allowed the supply of the prescription drugs to explode. That led opioids to proliferate, landing in the hands of not just patients but also teens rummaging through their parents’ medicine cabinets, other family members, friends of patients, and the black market. (More on the opioid epidemic’s causes and evolution in Vox’s explainer.)  The crisis has led policymakers and health care providers to look at cutting back on prescription opioids. But this comes with a challenge: Policymakers and health care providers also want to make sure that the drugs are available to patients who truly need them.  The study shows that this really might be possible, at least in the kind of emergency room setting that the researchers looked at. If nothing else, it should lead some doctors to rethink the default mode they might have when it comes to acute pain — to always reach for the opioid.  As Chang told me, “If we can administer a combination of non-opioids to patients while they are in the [emergency department] and show them (as well as the treating physician) that it provides comparable pain relief to opioids, then the patient will likely be more accepting of a non-opioid upon discharge, and the physician may feel less pressure to prescribe an opioid.”  Several weeks ago, I underwent surgery for a minor heart condition. (Don’t worry; I’m not going to die — yet, anyway.) In my hospital room, I reported my pain score after the procedure as a six out of 10, and I was vocally resistant to getting opioids. The nurses gave me opioids anyway. I turned out fine, as most people who get opioids in these settings do. But Chang’s study suggests I could have been just as fine if I got a high dose of ibuprofen and acetaminophen instead. Yet there seemed to be a bias in favor of the opioids.  In general, this is what the response to the opioid epidemic has been about: weakening that bias in favor of opioids for treating pain — while ensuring that patients who truly need opioids can still get them.  This applies to chronic pain as well. The evidence for opioids treating chronic pain is very weak (despite their effectiveness for acute pain), while the evidence that opioids cause harm in the long term is very strong. And a recent study found that doctors can wean some chronic pain patients off opioids and actually improve their pain outcomes. More research is needed in this area, but the current evidence suggests that the risks of opioids might not be worth the gains, if there actually are any, for most chronic pain patients.  As with acute pain, that does not mean opioids will never be useful in chronic pain cases. When prescribed carefully on a schedule that works to diminish the excessive buildup of tolerance, they can work for some people. Stanford pain specialist Sean Mackey previously told me that opioids should not be a first-line treatment due to the risks, and alternatives should be tried first — but they can work for some chronic pain patients, and keeping them from such patients can cause unnecessary harm and suffering.  So opioid policy, as with many public health issues, is a balancing act. But studies like Chang’s and other research suggest that it is possible to moderate our opioid use and not inflict unnecessary harm on patients. That could be a crucial step in confronting the ongoing drug epidemic and preventing more crises like it in the future.",1.0,2.0

If President Trump could collect rent for all of the time he lives in the liberal heads of MSNBC hosts Mika and her mamby-pamby boyfriend, Joe Scarborough, he could be an even richer man…  A former governor of Puerto Rico shut down a question from MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski on Wednesday when she asked about President Donald Trump’s treatment of San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz.  Trump and Cruz’s interactions and criticisms have drawn national attention during the process of helping Puerto Rico recover from Hurricane Maria, with Cruz charging that the Trump administration has been too slow in delivering federal assistance. Trump tweeted criticism of her over the weekend, saying she exhibited “poor leadership” and that others in Puerto Rico were not doing enough to “get their workers to help.”  Trending: AMERICA’S BIGGEST LOSER Explains Why Multiple Sexual Assault Claims Against Bill Clinton Are Not As Serious As Kavanaugh’s…Calls For CIVIL WAR!

Luis Fortuño to the show, she asked him what he made of Trump’s treatment of Cruz.  “I’m very sorry, Mika, but I’m not going to get into local politics,” Fortuño said.  Brzezinski did a double take upon hearing his answer.  “If she’s running for governor, there are different parties—I don’t care,” Fortuño said. “I care about results.”  “Is that what you think it is?” Brzezinski asked. “You think it was politics that had him attacking her?”  “I have no idea,” he said. “All I can tell you is we need results. We have people that desperately need help. As long as we get that help, we should not be talking about politics at this moment.”  –WFB",1.0,3.0
972,2512,10,24,2017,2017-10-24,Vox,6 key quotes from Sen. Jeff Flake’s speech blasting Trump,"On Tuesday, Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona became the latest politician to question the health of American democracy in the age of Trump. In a speech announcing he would not seek reelection in 2018, Flake delivered a searing rebuke of Trump and blasted members of his own party for failing to speak out against the president.  The speech seems likely to become part of Flake’s political legacy. You can read the full transcript here, but here are six of the most memorable lines:  Flake decries the “indecency of our discourse and the coarseness of our leadership”  From the beginning of his speech, the Arizona senator did not mince his words and started by calling America’s leadership “coarse” and national discourse “indecent” under the Trump presidency:  I rise today with no small measure of regret. Regret because of the state of our disunion, regret because of the disrepair and destructiveness of our politics. Regret because of the indecency of our discourse. Regret because of the coarseness of our leadership. Regret for the compromise of our moral authority, and by our, I mean all of our complicity in this alarming and dangerous state of affairs. It is time for our complicity and our accommodation of the unacceptable to end.  He warns against a “new normal”  Flake warned against this kind of behavior becoming common in Washington politics, and described it as unhelpful to American voters:  The personal attacks, the threats against principles, freedoms, and institutions, and the flagrant disregard for truth and decency, the reckless provocations, most often for the pettiest and most personal reasons, reasons having nothing whatsoever to do with the fortunes of the people that we have been elected to serve. None of these appalling features of our current politics should ever be regarded as normal.  He jabs directly at President Trump’s behavior  Several times throughout his speech, Flake addressed Trump directly. And throughout, he decried Trump’s behavior and said it has a chilling effect on a healthy democracy:  Reckless, outrageous, and undignified behavior has become excused and countenanced as telling it like it is when it is actually just reckless, outrageous, and undignified. And when such behavior emanates from the top of our government, it is something else. It is dangerous to a democracy.  Flake makes an appeal to his fellow Republicans  In addition to his indictment of the president, Flake also castigated his Republican colleagues for not doing more to speak up against Trump, and said that past excuses for Trump’s behavior from lawmakers can no longer be believed:  When the next generation asks us, why didn't you do something? Why didn't you speak up? What are we going to say? Mr. President, I rise today to say, enough. We must dedicate ourselves to making sure that the anomalous never becomes the normal. With respect and humility, I must say that we have fooled ourselves for long enough that a pivot to governing is right around the corner, civility and stability right behind it. We know better than that. By now, we all know better than that.  He says Trump’s tweets are a threat to the “stability of the entire world”  As fellow Republican Sen. Bob Corker has done, Flake talked about a very real concern among Republicans and Democrats alike that Trump is too unstable to lead, and that the president’s social media outbursts could have extreme real-world consequences. Earlier this month, Corker said that Trump’s threats could “start World War III,” and Flake echoed that sentiment in his speech on Tuesday:  If I have been critical, it is because I believe it is my obligation to do so, and as a matter and duty of conscience, the notion that one should stay silent as the norms and values that keep America strong are undermined and as the alliances and agreements that ensure the stability of the entire world are routinely threatened by the level of thought that goes into 140 characters, the notion that we should say or do nothing in the face of such mercurial behavior is ahistoric and, I believe, profoundly misguided.  He questions his place in the current Republican Party  Flake was not shy about criticizing the members of his own party for, as he put it, abandoning their core principles and forgetting about the people they were elected to serve. He called on his fellow Republicans to return to the party’s core values rather than support Trump’s brand of politics:",5.0,9.0
19,145,8,30,2017,2017-08-30,Associated Press News,"Harvey knocks out more refineries, shifting global oil flows","ADDS NAME OF REFINERY - This aerial photo shows the Flint Hills Resources oil refinery near downtown Houston on Tuesday, Aug. 29, 2017. (AP Photo/D1avid J. Phillip)  DALLAS (AP) — Hurricane Harvey is sending pump prices higher for U.S. motorists and causing temporary shifts in the flow of oil and gasoline around the world after taking down a huge chunk of U.S. refining capacity.  It will be days or even weeks before the energy sector in the southeast Texas Gulf Coast is back to normal operations as it deals with flooding in the aftermath of Harvey, which has been downgraded to a tropical storm. The region from Corpus Christi, Texas, where Harvey made landfall, to the Louisiana state line accounts for about 3 percent of the U.S. economy and is a crucial export market for oil and chemicals.  Wednesday brought news that the nation’s biggest refinery, which was already running below half-speed, had begun a complete shutdown. The Motiva Enterprises plant in Port Arthur, Texas, run by a unit of the state-owned oil company of Saudi Arabia, was the latest domino to fall among Gulf Coast refineries.  More than one-fifth of U.S. refining capacity has been shuttered, according to S&P Global Platts.  With that, gasoline futures headed higher for a third straight day. They had climbed 10 cents to $1.88 a gallon Wednesday  Retail gas prices climbed, too, up 2 cents a gallon on Wednesday and 7 cents in the past week, to a national average price of $2.42 per gallon, according to Gasbuddy.  “In terms of product price increases, it might get worse before it gets better,” said Rob Smith, an energy analyst with IHS Markit.  It could take two weeks or longer before big refineries in the Houston area can recover from a record-setting deluge and resume normal operations. That assumes they didn’t suffer serious damage, which is still unknown.  Harvey isn’t the first big storm to hit the refinery-rich Gulf Coast, but the oil industry has undergone big changes since the last major interruption from Hurricane Ike in 2008.  The so-called shale revolution has led to a surge in oil production in the U.S., increasing the nation’s exports of crude oil and gasoline to Mexico and other places in Latin America, and diesel to Europe.  When the U.S. can’t produce enough gasoline or diesel to meet export demands, other regions are forced to look for replacement supplies “and the backfill has to come from further away,” said Richard Joswick, an analyst with S&P Global Platts. “It has to come from Asia even.”  The result will be higher prices, but it should be just a one- or two-week problem, Joswick said.  Patrick DeHaan, an analyst for GasBuddy, predicts that U.S. gasoline prices will top out around $2.50 or $2.55 a gallon, an increase of up to 20 cents since Harvey hit, with bigger spikes closer to the Gulf.  The recovery from Harvey will mimic the storm’s path from west to east. Flint Hill Resources’ refinery in Corpus Christi, where Harvey made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane, could begin to restart — a process that takes days — as early as Wednesday. Other refineries in the area are likely to do the same later this week.  “It takes some time to start up a refinery under normal circumstances, and it wouldn’t be surprising if they run into hiccups,” said Smith, the HIS Markit analyst. “It could be a week if not longer before Corpus Christi is at normal operations.”  Exxon, Shell and other companies have reported to Texas regulators that some of their storage tanks and other facilities near Houston were damaged by the torrential rains and flooding. Most of the reports seem to indicate relatively minor damage, but still it could be days before crews can assess matters and make repairs.  Even once the refineries are running, pipelines and ports are needed to carry their gasoline, diesel and other fuels to consumers.  A major pipeline supplying the East Coast with gasoline remains shut down — partly because with refineries closed, there is nothing to ship, but also because of damage in at least three areas. Another pipeline that carries crude from the big Permian Basin field in Texas to Houston-area refineries is also closed.  Other sectors are also slowly emerging from Harvey’s mess.  —INSURANCE: Damage estimates from wind, storm surges and flooding are soaring, with Moody’s Analytics putting them between $51 billion and $75 billion. RMS, a company that advises insurers, estimates the cost at $70 billion to $90 billion. TD Economics said Harvey will cut 0.1 to 0.4 points from U.S. third-quarter economic growth.  — SHIPPING: In a hopeful sign, port officials in Corpus Christi say that an initial check turned up some damage from Harvey’s landfall over the weekend, but they hope to restart shipping on Monday. First, however, the Coast Guard will have to declare the shipping lanes clear, and boat pilots will have to be satisfied it’s safe.  All four ports in the Houston area remain closed and aren’t likely to reopen for several days.  — TRAVEL: Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said Houston’s two airports would resume limited service late Wednesday afternoon.  United Airlines planned to operate three departures and three arrivals Wednesday night at Bush Intercontinental Airport, a spokesman said. Other carriers, such as American Airlines, planned to wait until Thursday. At Hobby Airport, Southwest Airlines, the dominant carrier, doesn’t plan any flights before Saturday, according to a spokeswoman.  More than 1,600 U.S. flights had been canceled by afternoon, most of them at the Houston airports, according to tracking service FlightAware.",1.0,1.0

How many of those same women were simultaneously begging Harvey Weinstein, who was apparently a well known sexual predator, for a job?  Well, today Harvey got some very bad news…  Harvey Weinstein, the disgraced co-founder and CEO of The Weinstein Company, has been fired effective immediately, his board of directors said on Sunday.  The statement said:  “In light of new information about misconduct by Harvey Weinstein that has emerged in the past few days, the directors of The Weinstein Company – Robert Weinstein, Lance Maerov, Richard Koenigsberg and Tarak Ben Ammar – have determined, and have informed Harvey Weinstein, that his employment with The Weinstein Company is terminated, effective immediately.”  The company has been under intense pressure since The New York Times broke an investigative story on Thursday detailing three decades of sexual misconduct, including propositioning actresses and harassing female employees. More ugly stories continued to dribble out over the weekend, including a vulgar report by a news anchor that Weinstein masturbated in front of her and other stories of inappropriate propositions.  Internally Weinstein continued to fight for his survival, insiders have told TheWrap. His advisors – including his brother Bob – told him that he needed to take the allegations seriously and not merely pay lip service. They wanted him to leave for six months and get treatment for sex addiction or whatever his behavior may be called.  Weinstein told TheWrap in an interview on Thursday that he was sincere in his apology and intention to make amends. But reports continued to leak out of the company internally that the CEO was determined to dictate the terms of his leave of absence and treatment.  Harvey and Bob Weinstein co-founded the indie film company Miramax in 1979 and grew it into a powerhouse brand that made art-house films mainstream — and reshaped the Academy Awards race with aggressive marketing and buzz.  The company was bought by Disney in 1993, where the brothers continued to run the company — and dominate the Oscar race — until they left in 2005 to launch the new privately held The Weinstein Company. The brothers have a 44 percent stake in the firm, according to the Times.  For entire story: The Wrap",49.0,67.0
589,1985,10,14,2017,2017-10-14,Associated Press News,Global finance leaders warn against complacency,"White House senior adviser Ivanka Trump accompanied by World Bank President Jim Yong Kim speaks at the forum Taking Women-Owned Business to the Next Level, on the sidelines of the World Bank/IMF annual meetings in Washington, Saturday, Oct. 14, 2017. ( AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Global finance leaders on Saturday appealed to central bankers to stick as long as possible with low-interest rate policies that have made borrowing attractive and helped safeguard an improving but still fragile world economic recovery.  Declaring the “recovery is not complete” even eight years after the 2008 financial crisis, the 189-nation International Monetary Fund wrapped up its fall meetings with a communique warning “there is no room for complacency” as nations confront new challenges to global growth from a range of threats, including cyber-security attacks and more violent weather patterns linked to climate change.  The meetings also dealt, at least on the sidelines, with efforts to better understand the policy implications of the Trump administration’s more forceful “America First” agenda.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he had productive discussions during nearly 20 one-on-one meetings with other countries plus the joint sessions of the IMF and World Bank policy committees, as well as two days of talks centered on the Group of 20 major industrial countries.  Donald Trump won the presidency with pledges to toughen enforcement of U.S. trade laws and trim huge U.S. trade deficits with nations such as China and Mexico, which Trump has accused of unfair trade practices that have cost millions of American manufacturing jobs.  Mnuchin said he agreed with an assessment of German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble that the discussions this week were more relaxed than the initial talks held earlier this year, when the Trump team had first taken office, because there was a better understanding of Trump’s goals.  “We believe in free and fair and reciprocal trade,” Mnuchin told reporters Saturday, saying the Trump administration is simply trying to make sure U.S. workers and companies are treated fairly in trade deals with other nations.  Mnuchin said he carried in his pocket a list of all the G-20 nations and the size of the trade balances the United States has with each of those nations. With most of the G-20 countries, the United States is running a trade deficit.  Schauble, the chairman of the G-20 finance group this year, said he believed the backlash against globalization was giving way to a greater understanding that the path toward rising prosperity for all depends on greater cooperation among countries.  But the Trump administration so far has been highly skeptical of various multilateral organizations. This week, the United States pulled out of UNESCO, the United Nations’ cultural agency. It has scrapped an Asia-Pacific trade deal and is threatening to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. And it is has balked at providing additional capital to the World Bank unless the anti-poverty agency rethinks the way it distributes loans.  In his speech Saturday to the IMF policy group, Mnuchin said he wanted to see the IMF be a more “forceful advocate” for strong global growth by imposing more stringent surveillance on the economic policies being pursued by its member countries and by taking a hard look at changes that needed to be made by countries running large trade surpluses.  While the IMF communique called on major central banks to protect the global recovery by being cautious in withdrawing the support it has had in place since the 2008 financial crisis, in many cases the trend seems to be moving in the opposite direction.  In the United States, the Federal Reserve has raised short-term interest rates twice this year and is beginning to reduce its large portfolio of bonds, a move that could push long-term rates higher. In Europe, the euro currency has risen since spring on expectations that the European Central Bank will withdraw its long-standing stimulus program. The ECB meets Oct. 26.  “Monetary policy should remain accommodative, where inflation is still below target and output gaps” still exist, the communique said.  On Saturday, Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and a White House adviser, appeared with World Bank President Jim Yong Kim to launch a World Bank initiative to support women entrepreneurs. The World Bank fund has raised $350 million, which is designed to allow the World Bank to deploy at least $1 billion in capital to finance women-owned businesses.  Ivanka Trump told the audience she wanted to “spend a lot of time offering any value that I can as a mentor.”",56.0,70.0
51,266,9,2,2017,2017-09-02,Fox News,A big opportunity for Scott Pruitt and Team Trump to demonstrate its support for American ingenuity and innovation,"The economy will be front and center when Congress returns next week with action on the debt ceiling, the budget and tax cuts coming soon. The Trump administration has already made significant strides toward getting the economy back on track, especially when it comes to regulatory reform – progress that’s been reflected in the markets.  The Trump administration, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in particular under the leadership of Administrator Scott Pruitt, have taken a “smart growth” approach to cutting red tape and rolling back regulations.  Contrary to what many on the left may say, Trump and Pruitt are not anti-regulation as long as regulations aren’t overly costly and burdensome and they don’t hinder or hurt American job growth that is the administration’s top priority.  As evidence, Pruitt was right to defend the EPA’s Significant New Alternatives Policy or SNAP program when companies from France and Mexico sued in federal court to have it scrapped. A three-judge panel ruled in a split decision, 2-1, to get rid of this program but there’s a chance the full court could reverse the ruling if Pruitt appeals.  This ruling was unfortunate, as it permitted foreign companies to transcend U.S. private sector investment and innovation that led to job growth here at home and the exporting of new technology around the world.  American ingenuity, combined with over a billion dollars of private investment – without a dime coming from the federal treasury – resulted in the development of new, safer environmental technology, only to see a court side with foreign companies.  The EPA program that created the landscape for these innovative, new technologies is actually rooted in the conservative environmental stewardship of former President Ronald Reagan and former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Pruitt should stand up for American investment, innovation and our workers by appealing this decision as there’s a chance the full court may side with him and the Trump administration.  In urging him to do so, former conservative presidential candidate Steve Forbes noted the ruling hurts U.S. companies and workers who invest and innovate. As Bloomberg News Intelligence chemicals analyst Christopher Perrella noted, “It’s good for the companies and it’s good for the planet. That’s a win-win regardless of your thoughts on climate change.”  Under the EPA’s program new chemical technologies that meet the market demand for certain products were developed with nary a dime from the federal treasury. These new chemicals, known as HFOs, are primarily used for refrigeration in homes, in cars, in mass transit and elsewhere.  If the ruling stands, private sector investment of over a billion dollars will have been for naught. The fallout could be even worse as the ruling will likely create a chilling effect (no pun intended) over American industry, as why should companies risk investing in the future only to have a court pull the rug out from under them?  Thus the ruling, while initially unfortunate, presents an opportunity for Pruitt and the Trump administration to demonstrate its support for American industry’s ingenuity and innovation – and the workers who provide it – as well as its support for effective environmental stewardship.  The economy is beginning to turn in the right direction and the United States is poised to be a leader on multiple fronts – including investment, development of needed technology, and the exporting of these products around the globe – which will only mean more good paying jobs for the American people.",1.0,2.0

598,1994,10,14,2017,2017-10-14,Vox,We need to change the way we think about the opioid crisis,"The way Americans are starting to get addicted to opioids has changed in the last 10 years, according to a new study published in Addictive Behaviors. As Dylan Scott explains on the October 13 episode of The Weeds: “In 2005, 80 percent of people who were dependent on opioids started with painkillers and 10 percent started with heroin. In 2015, that had shifted to about 50 percent of people started with painkillers and 33 percent started with heroin.”  Dylan, Sarah Kliff, and Matt Yglesias also discussed new findings on the opioid crisis and Trump’s decision to cut off some Obamacare subsidies, as well as the latest executive order on health care  This shift in the starting points of opioid addiction, with more people starting to use heroin first, is a challenge for lawmakers. “When starting with prescription drugs we know the policy levers to pull. There’s continuing medical education and prescribing deadlines. The policy levers with reducing the number of people starting on heroin seem more challenging,” Sarah said.  Dylan agreed, and said that members of the Senate Health Committee are focused mainly on prescription drugs, not heroin. “You go down to Capitol Hill and when the Senate holds a hearing on this, there seems to be a lot of talk of, ‘OK if we turn this lever, if he just make it harder for people to get a hold of prescription painkillers, then that will fix the problem,’ and this fundamental shift towards heroin proves that is not true,” Dylan said.  Here’s Dylan and Matt discussing the challenges of attacking heroin addictions:  Dylan: A repeated frustration that I have heard in talking to folks who work on this issue is that we focus almost entirely on the supply side of things, and whether that’s Donald Trump’s wall on the Mexican border or whether that’s better prescribing practices to preventing opioids from getting on the street, we don’t spend nearly as much time on how do we drive down the demand among a certain percentage of our population to want to abuse drugs. Matt: This is a really bad situation. When the move was made to crack down on pill suppliers, I think policy makers were aware that there was a risk that you were going to see a lot of people diverting into the heroin market. I think they did not fully understand the fentanyl situation. But they knew that this was going to take the stock of addicts and actually put them at greater risk for overdoses, and they decided that they had to make that call. That the only way to cut off the flow of new addicts was to make this choice. I think what you are seeing with the heroin initiations is that this sort of strategy to cauterize the wound and sacrifice a cohort of addicts to the streets and the black market but to cut off the new addicts, that that has not worked. That instead, this old stock of addicts has moved to heroin, and then the heroine dealers have now established a whole new pipeline into addiction that has nothing to do with the prescription drug market that the FDA can’t do anything about. Basically the whole discussion that we have been having is obsolete. Dylan: I went out to a city in southern Indiana last year that had a terrible HIV outbreak because of needle abuse. And you talk to people there and they are like, we need to change this on a cultural level, on an economic level. It is a really holistic problem that is not tailored to neat and tidy solutions like prescription drug monitoring programs.  Show notes:",5.0,6.0

The interview with local Australian TV has several delusional moments that reveal her continued bitterness and downright psychosis when it comes to the 2016 election loss to Donald Trump.  Trending: AMERICA’S BIGGEST LOSER Explains Why Multiple Sexual Assault Claims Against Bill Clinton Are Not As Serious As Kavanaugh’s…Calls For CIVIL WAR! [VIDEO]  “I think Assange has become a nihilistic opportunist who does the bidding of a dictator,” Clinton said, apparently referring to Russia’s Vladimir Putin.    Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court? Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?  Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court? * Yes, he will be confirmed. No, he will not be confirmed.        When the interviewer noted many people view Assange as a “martyr for free speech and freedom of information.”…Clinton wasn’t having it and shot back:  “I mean, he’s a tool of Russian intelligence. If he’s such a martyr for free speech, why doesn’t WikiLeaks ever publish anything coming out of Russia?”  The interviewer then did something our American media never does. She challenged Clinton with this question:  “Isn’t he just doing what journalists do which is publish information when they get it?”  HERE’S WHERE HILLARY GOES OFF THE RAILS:  “I don’t think so,” Hillary snapped. “I think for number one, it’s stolen information, and number two, if all you did was publish it, that would be one thing,” she asserted, before claiming there was a “concerted operation between WikiLeaks and Russia and most likely, people in the United States to, as I say, weaponized that information.”  Hillary Clinton says Julian Assange is a “tool of Russian intelligence”  HERE’S WHERE ASSANGE NAILS HILLARY:  Assange came back at Clinton with a PERFECT description of her “cold creepiness”. He tweeted out that people should “watch closely” and see that there is something “much darker” than the lying and “menacing glares”:    “There’s something wrong with Hillary Clinton. It is not just her constant lying,” he tweeted.  “It is not just that she throws off menacing glares and seethes thwarted entitlement. Watch closely. Something much darker rides along with it. A cold creepiness rarely seen.”  The interviewer goes on to ask Hillary about Fox News:  In more from the interview, it’s clear Hillary needs some therapy. She claims that Jim Comey “shivved her”. That is a prison term for being murdered with a knife. What the heck made her use that term? Now that’s REALLY creepy!  She also lied AGAIN and said our voting systems were attacked:",15.0,30.0
1117,2695,10,29,2017,2017-10-29,Associated Press News,Indonesia court upholds seizure of illegal fishing vessel," Indonesia says it has won a two-year court battle that confirms the legality of the government’s seizure of a Thai vessel linked to human trafficking and illegal fishing in Indonesian waters.  Minister of Fisheries and Maritime Affairs Susi Pudjiastuti said the “monumental” ruling from a court in Aceh province shows that governments can win in the fight against cross-border crime.  Pudjiastuti said in a statement this week that the ministry plans to make the refrigerated cargo ship Silver Sea 2 part of a museum to teach the public about illegal fishing.  The ship was seized by Indonesia’s navy in August 2015 amid a crackdown on illegal fishing and after an Associated Press investigation showed its links to human trafficking in the fishing industry.  Several months before its capture, the ship and Thai fishing trawlers had abruptly left an island in remote eastern Indonesia, where the Thai fishing industry held trafficked crew members captive, to escape a government crackdown on illegal fishing.  The AP, which was investigating slavery on fishing vessels, subsequently identified where the cargo ship had fled using satellite images from U.S.-based DigitalGlobe that became evidence in the Indonesian government’s court case.  Pudjiastuti said the vessel’s violations included intentionally turning off electronic systems that allowed the ship’s location to be tracked by maritime authorities and other vessels. DNA testing was used to prove that the $1.5 million of fish on board was from Indonesian waters.  When identified in the DigitalGlobe satellite images, the Silver Sea 2 was in Papua New Guinea waters, receiving illegal Indonesian catch from two fishing trawlers in a process known as transshipment.  It was captured by an Indonesian navy vessel off the island of Sumatra after returning to Indonesian waters. The Thai captain was detained and a probe launched into suspected human trafficking, transporting illegal fish and off-loading the catch at sea.  The Pulitzer Prize-winning AP investigation resulted in the freeing of more than 2,000 men from Myanmar, Cambodia, Thailand and Laos, more than a dozen arrests, the changing of U.S. legislation, and lawsuits. However, the global seafood industry continues to be plagued by illegal fishing and labor abuses at sea.",51.0,55.0
922,2413,10,22,2017,2017-10-22,Media Matters,"Of all the Sunday shows, only Dana Bash on CNN asked a GOP senator about changes to 401(k) contributions","CNN’s Dana Bash was the only host of a Sunday morning political show to ask a Republican lawmaker or official about a potential tax reform provision that is reportedly being considered that would limit pre-tax 401(k) contributions. Such a move would limit how much money millions of middle class Americans would be able to set aside for retirement.  The New York Times reported that Republicans are considering a proposal to put limits on how much American workers can contribute to their 401(k) accounts before taxes, potentially decreasing caps from $18,000 a year (or $24,000 for workers over 50) to “as low as $2,400.” The Times noted that this move would likely cause “a vocal backlash from middle-class workers who save heavily in such retirement accounts.” As CNBC reported in 2015, over 13 million people have 401(k) retirement plans.  While several Republican lawmakers and officials made the rounds on the Sunday morning political shows to discuss tax reform, Bash was the only host to ask one of them about the 401(k) proposal. In an interview with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) on State of the Union, Bash asked what he plans to do if Republicans were to take this path, which, she pointed out, “could mean higher taxes on the middle class.”  From the October 22 Edition of CNN’s State of the Union:  DANA BASH (HOST): Let me just drill down on one other aspect of taxes, and that is The New York Times reported this week that House Republicans are considering a plan to sharply reduce the amount of income that Americans can save in tax-deferred 401(k) accounts. If a Republican -- if your fellow Republicans in the House were to push to go down this path, it could mean higher taxes on the middle class. What do you want to do? Is this a nonstarter in the Senate? SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): Well, look, we're just beginning the process of actually crafting the bills that will be crafted in the Ways and Means Committee in the House, the Finance Committee in the Senate. It's way too early to predict the various details. But I can tell you, the goal here, the goal here is to get middle class taxes down, to prevent job exportation, -- which our current business taxes really encourage people to go offshore -- and to produce more jobs and opportunity for the American people. That's the goal. The details will be hashed out in these two committees in the coming weeks.  Juan Williams also appeared to allude to the proposal on Fox News Sunday.  DANA PERINO (HOST): If the Republicans add a millionaires tax, what would [Sens. Chuck] Schumer [D-NY] and Elizabeth Warren [D-MA] complain about? JUAN WILLIAMS: Still, I think Congressman [Jason] Chaffetz is onto something here, it’s still -- we don’t have a revenue source screen that would really offset the cost of the tax cuts. Let me just say, overall this was supposed to be about tax reform. Apparently, that’s not the issue now, we’re just on to tax cuts. So the argument coming from the Democrats is this really is disportionately beneficial to the very rich. You add the fourth bracket, but it still does nothing in terms of offsetting things like doing away with state and local deductions. PERINO: That’s a big issue. WILLIAMS: That’s a huge -- how about home mortgage. Imagine, no home mortgage deduction? Well, I’m sure K Street -- PERINO: Well, they're not saying that. WILLIAMS: Well, they are making the case. And then, also less in terms of your retirement contribution. So these are things that would squeeze the middle class.

1365,2966,11,4,2017,2017-11-04,The New York Times,"Salvador Minuchin, a Pioneer of Family Therapy, Dies at 96","He added: “We work with the family to get their conflicts out into the open, so that everybody can see that their problem isn’t that they have a little girl who won’t eat, but that the family is enmeshed — they are all into each other’s lives so much that the system simply can’t work. The children have no rights as children; the parents have no rights as parents.”  Dr. Minuchin said it made no sense to blame parents for their children’s psychosomatic disorders.  “There’s no perfect family; it’s a myth,” he said. “One set of circumstances might lead to an anorexic child, another to a depressive. Perfect parenting is an impossible thing, like being a perfect president or something like that. It’s trying to do good through a series of mistakes. It’s part of the human condition.  “No one,” he added, “knows how to do it right.”  Dr. Minuchin, a son of Jewish immigrants from Russia, was born on Oct. 13, 1921, in San Salvador, Argentina, north of Buenos Aires. His father, Mauricio, owned a small store and, after it failed during the Depression, herded horses. His mother was the former Clara Tolachier.  Salvador Minuchin was inspired to help young delinquents after a high school teacher, quoting the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, described them as victims of society. He later became active in leftist protests opposing the military government’s seizure of Argentine universities and was jailed for several months.  After earning a medical degree from the National University of Córdoba in Argentina, he enlisted in the Israeli Army during the 1948 war for independence.  Dr. Minuchin studied child psychiatry in the United States with Dr. Nathan Ackerman, who later established what is now the Ackerman Institute for the Family in Manhattan. He returned to Israel to treat Holocaust orphans and children displaced by wars, then came back to New York to train in psychoanalysis at the William Alanson White Institute.  He went on to work as a child psychiatrist at the Wiltwyck School for delinquent boys in the Hudson Valley, where he developed his theory of what became known as structural family therapy. He recounted his experiences with several co-authors in “Families of the Slums” (1967).",7.0,6.0
959,2474,10,23,2017,2017-10-23,Associated Press News,New flight paths lead to airplane noise complaints across US," Airliners began flying over Twila Lake’s bungalow-style house in a historic district three years ago, taking off every one to two minutes from the Phoenix airport and roaring over her neighborhood. It was a sudden change after rarely hearing jets in her previous 13 years in the downtown neighborhood.  Now, “it’s all day and night long,” complained the 71-year-old retiree, who said she sleeps with the television on to drown out aircraft noise. Some neighbors sold their homes and moved after the aviation highway entrance ramp was routed overhead.  The Federal Aviation Administration started revising flight paths and procedures around the United States in 2014 under its air traffic control modernization plan known as “NextGen.” The new procedures use more precise, satellite-based navigation that saves time, increases the number of planes airports can service, and reduces fuel burn and emissions.  Noise complaints exploded from San Diego to Charlotte, North Carolina, to New York as flights were concentrated at lower altitudes, in narrower paths and on more frequent schedules. The new paths often reduce the number of people exposed to noise, but those who get noise get it far more consistently.  In Phoenix, redrawn flights over vintage neighborhoods like Lake’s affect some 2,500 homes, prompting a court challenge from historic districts and the city.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Aug. 29 agreed with their assessment that the FAA was “arbitrary and capricious” in revising flight procedures. FAA officials asked for an extension, and the court this month pushed the petition deadline to Nov. 16.  Local governments and residents in more than a half-dozen other areas - including Washington’s Georgetown neighborhood and California’s Newport Beach, Laguna Beach, Orange County and Culver City - have similar petitions before the court.  Attorney Steven Taber, who represents several Southern California communities with complaints, predicted legal action over flight changes will be a continuing problem across the U.S.  Aviation experts said they don’t expect the Phoenix ruling to set a precedent for other cities, but it is forcing the FAA to be more responsive.  “We certainly view it as one of the most egregious cases of a lack of community involvement,” said Chris Oswald, vice president of safety and regulatory affairs with Airports Council International-North America. The FAA has since done more outreach elsewhere, he said.  Policy analyst Rui Neiva of the Eno Center for Transportation think tank in Washington said agency officials must find a middle ground.  “In some cases, they may have to settle on a path that is less efficient, or create several additional paths,” he said.  But David Grizzle, a former FAA chief operating officer, said it’s not possible to redesign procedures to address the problem and still reap NextGen’s technology advantages.  “There is an intrinsic issue of concentrating noise in particular places that comes with precision-based navigation that is inescapable,” he said.  FAA officials knew a decade ago some homeowners would suffer more noise because of the changes, but hoped their complaints would be offset by the people who benefited, Grizzle said. But those people haven’t spoken up.  The FAA said in a statement it is reviewing the Phoenix decision and working with residents near airports around the country through “noise roundtables” to balance community interests with needed improvements to the national airspace system.  In Phoenix, “simply reverting to previous air traffic control procedures is not viable,” the agency said. The new procedures are “interdependent,” and any changes to one would have a domino effect, it said.  FAA officials claimed a “categorical exclusion” for Phoenix, which they said allowed them to forgo the customary environmental assessment because any changes in flight procedures were not expected to have an adverse impact. When Phoenix filed a challenge, the FAA sought to have it dismissed, arguing it was not filed in a timely fashion.  The court ruled that by keeping people in the dark, the agency made it impossible for the public to submit views on the project’s potential effects - something the FAA is especially required to do for historic areas and parks.  People elsewhere also complain the FAA failed to adequately explain the planned changes or provide opportunities to comment. In some areas, people say they didn’t know changes were coming because the FAA advertised them in places people wouldn’t normally look, such as government webpages.  In the Washington metro area, Georgetown University and neighborhood groups complained the FAA left them out of the loop and failed to properly assess the effect of changes at Ronald Reagan National Airport.  Residents said that until spring 2015, departing flights traveled a straight line over the Pentagon, Arlington National Cemetery and commercial areas of Rosslyn, Virginia. Now, a major departure path routes planes alongside historic Georgetown.  Roberto Vittori said he didn’t know about the FAA’s plans when he bought his home near Georgetown University’s medical school. Vittori wrote in a legal declaration last year that he spent $12,000 on soundproof glass for the home’s double-paned windows, but it was “still inadequate to muffle the noise.”  In Maryland, residents have complained about aircraft noise from Reagan National and Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan recently ordered the state’s attorney general to prepare a lawsuit against the FAA over routes he said were making families “miserable in their own homes.”  Santa Cruz, California, residents have complained of noise from planes headed to San Francisco International Airport but said they decided to work with federal officials rather than go to court.  For some 30 years, San Francisco-bound aircraft traveled over unpopulated areas, but residents were surprised last year when planes began flying closer to their homes, Denise Stansfield said.  Through the Save our Skies Santa Cruz citizens group Stansfield founded, a committee of residents, elected officials and FAA representatives began meeting to devise less obtrusive flight procedures. The process is ongoing, but residents are optimistic.  Initially, the FAA “didn’t consider the impact for people on the ground,” group member Vicki Miller said. “I think they are reassessing.”  ___  Lowy reported from Washington.",73.0,116.0

Gasoline prices in the U.S. have risen to new high amid continuing fears of shortages in Texas and other states after Hurricane Harvey's strike. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)  DALLAS (AP) — The spike in gasoline prices in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey has hit the accelerator.  The national average for regular was $2.56 a gallon by late Friday afternoon, an increase of 20 cents in the last week, according to GasBuddy.  Prices jumped at least 10 cents a gallon in 24 hours in Texas, Ohio, Georgia and the Mid-Atlantic states, travel club AAA reported.  The nationwide average was already higher than most experts had given as a worst-case scenario when flooding from the devastating storm began knocking out refineries along the Texas Gulf Coast a week ago.  Two of the leading price-forecasting analysts, GasBuddy’s Patrick DeHaan and Tom Kloza of the Oil Price Information Service, now see the national average peaking as high as $2.75 a gallon in the next few days.  Many stations in the Dallas area were out of gas Friday, and those that had it were often charging more than $3 a gallon — and drawing long lines of desperate drivers.  Texas Gov. Greg Abbott tried to reassure drivers that there is plenty of gasoline.  “Don’t worry, we will not run out,” Abbott said, “and we will be back into our normal pattern before you know it.”  The analysts said interruptions in supply were isolated and lines were largely the result of people rushing out to top off their tanks. DeHaan said only one rack, or wholesale gasoline terminal, out of the six in the Dallas area was dry.  “There is enough gas out there,” he said. “It’s just a matter of getting it to the right places before motorists panic.”  Valero Energy, a major refiner for the Texas market, said it was shipping only slightly reduced volumes to major cities in the state, although deliveries in Houston were still hampered by flooding.  Long lines could pop up next in the Southeastern and Eastern states, as far north as New York, which get much of their gasoline from the Colonial Pipeline that taps into refineries in Texas and Louisiana. The operator doesn’t expect the pipeline to resume normal operations until Sunday. On top of that, analysts said some gasoline from the Northeast is being diverted to Florida, and gasoline exports are contributing to the higher prices.  The U.S. now exports large amounts of gasoline, especially to Mexico and other parts of Latin America, and buyers there are competing with domestic distributors and bidding up prices.  How long this lasts will depend on how quickly the Gulf Coast refineries are back in business, especially the giants like Motiva’s Port Arthur, Texas, plant and the Exxon Mobil refinery in Baytown, near Houston.  One Chevron station in downtown Dallas that was selling regular for $2.29 a gallon before Harvey bumped up its price to $2.99 on Thursday, and a nearby Shell station was asking $3.97.  QuikTrip, one of the nation’s largest convenience store chains, temporarily halted gasoline sales at about half its 135 stores in the Dallas-Fort Worth area to send the fuel to a few designated stores across the area, said company spokesman Mike Thornbrugh.  Ten Texas refineries remained shut down Friday and another 10 were running at reduced rates or restarting, according to the Energy Department. About 4 million barrels per day of refining capacity was shut down — more than one-fifth of the nation’s supply. Some of that supply is expected to return within a week.  Spiro Dounis, an energy analyst with UBS, said it could take three months for the industry to produce at normal rates based on the experience after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.  ___  Paul Weber in Austin, Texas, and Claudia Lauer in Dallas contributed to this report.",1.0,2.0
94,550,9,7,2017,2017-09-07,Fox News,Tax cut would bring long-awaited hope and change,"As the end of President Trump’s first year in office nears, Republicans are desperate for a victory. Following their failure to pass health care reform, polling shows they trail Democrats by nine percentage points in a generic 2018 House race. The GOP has one last hope to save its first year agenda: passing middle class and small business tax cuts.  Recent Gallup polling shows “significant” middle class tax cuts are supported by a sizable majority of Americans. For good reason. Too many hardworking taxpayers struggle to make ends meet.  Despite modest recent improvement, median wages have stagnated for most of this century. New survey data shows that four out of five full time employees are living paycheck-to-paycheck.  A recent Federal Reserve report finds that nearly half of Americans could not cover an unexpected $400 expense like a car repair or home appliance replacement. Meanwhile, health care, housing, and child care costs have skyrocketed. A tax cut is the most direct way to boost wages and provide these families some relief.    A tax cut for American small businesses, over which the economic recovery has largely passed, would do just as much good. It would allow small businesses to keep more of their earnings, reversing their decades-long decline and reinvigorating Main Streets in communities across the country.  Consider the results of a recent Job Creators Network nationwide poll of small business owners: Most respondents said they would reinvest their tax cut savings in the form of employee wage hikes, new hires, and expansion.    This suggests a tax cut could address the problem of stagnating wages twice. First, by directly giving all hardworking taxpayers an immediate raise in their take home pay. Second, by allowing small business employers the funds to provide a pay raise.    Whether your politics are left, right, or center, this is something we can all agree on: More money in more Americans’ pockets is a good thing for everyone.  More money in our communities and less shipped off to Washington D.C. would produce a major economic stimulus, helping the country get back to its historic economic growth rate above three percent. This economic growth would help offset the fiscal costs of a tax cut.  Americans have shouldered the costs of out-of-control Capitol Hill spending for too long. But rather than cut costs, Washington keeps hitting withdraw, withdraw, withdraw. The government treats taxpayer wages like a Take-a-Penny tray.  In order to highlight the substantial benefits of a tax cut for American small businesses, families, and communities, my organization, Job Creators Network, is launching a major tax cut campaign, which includes a nationwide bus tour with a rally stop at the IRS building in Washington D.C.  The message is simple: Pass a tax cut retroactive to January 1st and give working and middle class Americans a bigger paycheck by returning some of the money the government took from them last year – hundreds of dollars a month – to their wallets today.    Think of what a family of four could do with a few hundred extra dollars: cover unexpected expenses, keep up with out-of-control health care costs, buffer savings accounts, or even take a well-deserved vacation. And think of what a small business could do: raise wages for loyal employees, hire some weekend help, expand into new product lines, or give back to the community. It’s their money. They earned it. They should have the final say on how to spend it.  It’s time for Congress to come together and deliver results that actually matter at the dinner table. To recognize what hardworking taxpayers plainly need and deserve.  We’re not asking for a sweeping overhaul of the federal tax code. We’re not asking for a once-in-a-generation, bipartisan omnibus reform package. We’re asking for a simple, one-time tax cut that puts a few extra dollars back in people’s pockets in time for the holidays. By next year, it will be too late",2.0,2.0
1517,3185,11,7,2017,2017-11-07,Vox,"Democrats picked up 2 seats in the Georgia state legislature, too","As part of a larger wave of Democratic wins on Election Day 2017, Democrats picked up two seats in special elections held for Georgia’s House of Delegates.  Deborah Gonzales won House District 117 with 53 percent of the vote and Jonathan Wallace won House District 119 with 56 percent of the vote. Both seats are in the Athens area and both were vacant, hence the special elections. But not only were the two seats previously held by Republican incumbents, they were uncontested in the 2016 elections.  Superior Democratic recruiting in these kind of races is both a cause and a consequence of a national political environment that is now Democratic leaning. It’s much easier to get people excited about running for office when the climate is favorable, so the uptick in recruiting is itself a result of Donald Trump’s unpopularity. But it’s also the case that no matter how unpopular Trump is, you can’t win elections without fielding candidates. In 2016, Democrats didn’t have candidates in these races. In 2017 they did, and they both won.  The result in HD-117 should be particularly alarming for Republicans. Mitt Romney won it by a crushing 54-44 margin back in 2012. Donald Trump fared much worse than that, winning by just 49-46, but nonetheless winning. That’s a broadly similar pattern to what Jon Ossoff faced earlier this year in Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District. But while Ossoff failed to improve on Hillary Clinton’s narrow loss, Gonzales ran 7 points stronger than Clinton and flipped what had been an overwhelmingly Republican district as recently as five years ago.  In terms of practical consequences, the Georgia legislature remains overwhelmingly Republican, so losing two seats isn’t a big deal. But with Georgia as a whole being a state where Trump ran considerably weaker than Romney, Democrats are eager to take a big swing at the 2018 gubernatorial election and — if they can win it — have more influence on the post-2020 redistricting process and thus a better shot at the legislature. Special elections only tell you so much, but tonight’s wins bring Georgia Democrats that much more hope of winning a year from now.",2.0,1.0

According to several media reports, 95 percent of the U.S. territory is still without power after the category 4 hurricane battered the island weeks ago. Some estimates have said that a full restoration of power may not return to Puerto Rico for as long as six months.  Tesla has not responded to a request for comment from Fox News.  Big opportunity for Tesla  In addition to selling electric cars, including the recently introduced Model 3, Tesla has an energy storage business, selling battery packs to commercial utilities, as well as home residences. It also has a solar panel business, after it acquired Solar City, co-founded by Musk's cousin Lyndon Rive, for $2.6 billion in November 2016.  Tesla has powered such smaller islands as Kauai in Hawaii and Ta'u in American Samoa, according to the company's website. The populations of those islands is far less than the 3.4 million people living in Puerto Rico.  James Murdoch, the CEO of 21st Century Fox, parent of Fox News, is a member of Tesla's board of directors.

Trump repeatedly addressed interlocking issues of security and trade at the heart of his visit after arriving Tuesday, saying he would be meeting with generals about North Korea. “Ultimately it will all work out. Because it always works out. It has to work out,” he said.  And later, after receiving a formal welcome from South Korean President Moon Jae-in, Trump also praised Seoul’s expansive purchases of American military equipment, which he said goes a long way to making the trade relationship between the two nations more equitable.  Moon said he hoped Trump’s visit would be an opportunity to resolve “anxiety” in the region over North Korea.  “I know that you have put this issue at the top of your security agenda,” Moon said at the presidential residence known as the Blue House, “so I hope that your visit to Korea and to the Asia Pacific region will serve as an opportunity to relieve some of the anxiety that the Korean people have due to North Korea’s provocations and also serve as a turning point in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue.”  President Donald Trump, speaking in Japan, said the shooting that killed 26 people in a church near San Antonio, Texas is the result of a 'mental health problem at the highest level. (Nov. 6)  Trump, in his own brief remarks, said Pyongyang would be “front and center” of discussions but avoided the fiery language he has used so often against North Korea and its dictator, Kim Jong Un.  The president also said he had a “terrific” meeting scheduled on trade, adding, “hopefully that’ll start working out and working out so that we create lots of jobs in the United States, which is one of the very important reasons I’m here.”  Trump, during a visit to Camp Humphreys that began his visit, sat with troops for lunch in a large mess hall. Moon was also seated at the table. “Good food,” Trump told reporters as he chatted with U.S. and Korean service members.  U.S. and South Korean officials have said the base visit was meant to underscore the countries’ ties and South Korea’s commitment to contributing to its own defense. Burden-sharing is a theme Trump has stressed ever since his presidential campaign.  South Korea is the second stop on Trump’s five country Asian tour. In Japan, he refused to rule out eventual military action against the north and exhorted dictator Kim Jong Un to stop weapons testing, calling the recent launches of missiles over American allies like Japan “a threat to the civilized world and international peace and stability.”  Trump is skipping the customary trip to the demilitarized zone separating north and south — a pilgrimage made by every U.S. president except one since Ronald Reagan as a demonstration of solidarity with the South. A senior administration recently dubbed the border trip as “a bit of a cliche” and several other members of the administration, including Vice President Mike Pence, have visited the DMZ this year. And the White House believes that Trump has already made his support of South Korea crystal clear.  Trump and Moon agree on the need to pressure the North with sanctions and other deterrence measures. But Trump has warned of unleashing “fire and fury,” threatened to “totally destroy” the North, if necessary, and repeatedly insisted that all options are on the table. Moon, meanwhile, favors dialogue as the best strategy for defusing the nuclear tension and vehemently opposes a potential military clash that could cause enormous casualties in South Korea.  Trump backed up his strong words about North Korea by sending a budget request to Capitol Hill on Monday for $4 billion to support “additional efforts to detect, defeat, and defend against any North Korean use of ballistic missiles against the United States, its deployed forces, allies, or partners.”  And as he departed for South Korea, he tweeted that Moon is “a fine gentleman,” adding, “We will figure it all out!”  On a personal level, Trump and Moon have not developed the same close rapport as Trump has with Abe or even China’s Xi Jinping. Part of Moon’s mission during the visit will likely be to strengthen his personal ties with Trump, said Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution.  “Now poor President Moon is playing catch-up ball because everyone acknowledges that he’s not bonding quite as much with Donald Trump as the rest of the region,” said O’Hanlon. He said Moon could face pressure “to deliver a stronger relationship” whereas “in most other parts of the world, people are trying to keep their distance from Donald Trump.”  Trump was spending Tuesday in meetings with Moon, hold a joint press conference and be feted at a state dinner.  Trade also is expected to be a major topic of discussion: Trump has considered pulling out of the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement, also known as KORUS, blaming it for the U.S.-South Korea trade deficit.  ___  Associated Press writers Ken Thomas and Catherine Lucey in Washington contributed to this report.  ___  Follow Colvin on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@colvinj and Lemire at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire.",1.0,0.0

A Russian booster rocket on Friday successfully put a European atmosphere monitoring satellite into orbit. The European Space Agency’s Sentinel-5P satellite was launched Friday by a Rokot missile from the Plesetsk launch pad in northwestern Russia. The satellite will map the global atmosphere every day, helping study air pollution. (ESA via AP)  MOSCOW (AP) — Russia successfully launched a satellite into orbit Friday that will monitor Europe’s atmosphere, helping to study air pollution.  The European Space Agency’s Sentinel-5P satellite was launched by a Rokot missile from the Plesetsk launch pad in northwestern Russia. The satellite will map the atmosphere every day.  After separating from the upper stage booster, the satellite deployed its solar panels and began communications with Earth, the ESA said. The first signal was received 93 minutes after launch as the satellite passed over the Kiruna station in Sweden.  Controllers at ESA’s operations center in Darmstadt, Germany, then established command and control links allowing them to monitor the satellite’s condition.  “The Sentinel-5P satellite is now safely in orbit so it is up to our mission control teams to steer this mission into its operational life and maintain it for the next seven years or more,” ESA Director General Jan Woerner said in a statement.  The mission will contribute to volcanic ash monitoring for aviation safety and for services that warn of high levels of UV radiation causing skin damage. The measurements also will help understand processes in the atmosphere related to the climate and to the formation of holes in the ozone layer.  It’s the sixth satellite in the ESA’s Copernicus program. Other Earth-observing Sentinel satellites launched earlier provide radar and optical imagery of the Earth, and monitor the condition of the world’s oceans and ice sheets.  “Having Sentinel-5P in orbit will give us daily and global views at our atmosphere with a precision we never had before,” ESA quoted Josef Aschbacher, the head of its earth observation programs, as saying.  Philippe Gaudy, who oversees the Sentinel project for the European Space Agency, said data collected by Sentinel 5P would help scientists to better monitor air pollution, such as for nitrogen oxide emitted by cars.  A recent report estimated that more than 400,000 people die prematurely in Europe alone because of air pollution.  Orbital observation can be used to compare reported air pollution by governments with actual data, to see whether countries are living up to their commitments under international treaties, Gaudy said.  The data from Sentinel-5P will be made available for free to anyone who wants it, he added.  It will take engineers several months to calibrate and validate the measurements, meaning data will start to become available in the first half of next year.",2.0,5.0

Says It Will Reject Tax Returns That Lack Health Insurance Disclosure,"People may have also mistakenly believed they did not have to comply with the law’s reporting requirements. The new guidance suggests taxpayers will now face a sharp reminder that they need to provide this information, when they go to file a return electronically or submit the appropriate paperwork to get any refund they are due.  Under the law, an individual who does not have insurance can face a penalty of $695 a year for an individual, up to a maximum of $2,085 for a family or 2.5 percent of your adjusted gross income, whichever is higher. People are exempt from the penalty if they have too little income or if the lowest-priced coverage available costs them more than 8.16 percent of their household income.  The I.R.S. had initially held off rejecting returns because the law was new, but then it delayed its plans to assess the effect of the executive order, said Nicole M. Elliott, a tax lawyer for Holland & Knight and a former I.R.S. official involved in putting into effect the Affordable Care Act.  “It is curious, given the executive order,” Ms. Elliott said. “It’s a little unclear where the agencies are going and how heavy-handed they will be in enforcing it.”  In evaluating its stance, the agency may have decided the requirement eases the burden on taxpayers by making it clear they need not worry if they have insurance or are exempt from the penalty, she said.  But the I.R.S. may still decide not to actively enforce the mandate, Ms. Elliott added. While the agency is taking steps to be sure it collects all the information necessary to levy the penalty, it could also take a very lenient view of how aggressively it goes after anyone who does not sign up. “It’s dangerous to read too much into this,” she said.  The White House declined to comment.  The I.R.S.’s decision to actively prepare to enforce the mandate only adds to the uncertainty about where the president stands about the future of the law. Just this month, he issued a second executive order aimed at allowing the sale of skimpier plans to both individuals and small businesses, the same day he announced he would abruptly stop funding subsidies for low-income individuals. He has abruptly switched positions on a new bipartisan proposal aimed at providing short-term stability to the insurance marketplaces under the law.",15.0,11.0

1315,2914,11,3,2017,2017-11-03,Breitbart,Report: Jared Kushner Turns Over Documents to Special Counsel Robert Mueller,"White House senior adviser Jared Kushner has turned over documents to special counsel Robert Mueller in recent weeks, and investigators have begun asking in witness interviews about the son-in-law’s role in the firing of former FBI Director James Comey, sources briefed on the probe told CNN.  Kushner reportedly advised the president to fire Comey, over the advice of some other senior advisers, and was present during a weekend when the president drafted a letter to fire the director.  The questioning of Kushner’s role in Comey’s firing signals that Mueller has moved past the campaign and is looking at whether there was any obstruction of justice in firing the former FBI director, who was then leading the Russia probe. Kushner is reportedly not a target of the investigation.  The 36-year-old voluntarily turned over documents from the campaign and from the transition, which were similar to ones he had given congressional investigators earlier this year.  A White House official told CNN that the special counsel’s questions about Kushner are not a surprise.  How much of a factor Kushner played in Comey’s firing is a point of dispute within the White House, with some sources telling CNN he had no influence and others calling him the “driver” of the decision.  Kushner has denied any collusion or wrongdoing during or after the election season.  Kushner has come under scrutiny for attending a meeting with a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower, which was set up under the premise that she had dirt on Hillary Clinton. During the meeting, the lawyer reportedly lobbied Donald Trump, Jr., Kushner, and then-campaign chair Paul Manafort on overturning the Magnitsky Act.  Kushner was also under scrutiny for meetings with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. and a Russian banker, and for failing to list hundreds of meetings with foreign contacts on his security clearance forms, which he blamed on an assistant.  Other “points of focus” on Kushner include his involvement on Trump’s campaign data analytics operation, and his relationship with former national security adviser Michael Flynn, sources told CNN.",6.0,9.0
426,1771,10,9,2017,2017-10-09,Fox News,North Korea: What would a nuclear attack look like?,"One single reliable warhead fired by North Korea could destroy densely populated cities, killing millions.  Those who aren’t killed in a nuclear blast would be left with devastating injuries while their cities would be flattened with vital infrastructure destroyed.  A detailed analysis by 38 North, at the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, has revealed what would happen if Kim Jong-un did the unthinkable and actually fired a nuclear weapon.  In A Hypothetical Nuclear Attack on Seoul and Tokyo: The Human Cost of War on the Korean Peninsula, Michael J Zagurek paints a terrifying picture of the damage it could cause.  Assuming North Korea has 25 operational nuclear weapons with warhead yield ranges from 15 to 250 kilotons timed for airburst at optimal altitude, Zagurek runs through seven different scenarios.  The warhead yield ranges are based on current and possible future capabilities and the estimates of casualties were also based on the size of the city and population density.  In the most extreme estimate of a 250kt weapon being used, Seoul and Incheon which has a combined population of 24,105,000 would have 783,197 fatalities, and 2,778,009 injuries.  Tokyo and Yokohama with a combined population of 37,900,000 would have 697,665 fatalities and 2,474,627 injuries.  Maps showing four blast areas from a 250 kt airburst detonation also show how far the fallout and blast would reach.  North Korea has launched 98 ballistic missiles since 2011, including 19 this year.  However it remains unclear exactly how many warheads it possesses and how advanced they are.  Nuclear disarmament campaigner John Hallam said the analysis was fairly authoritative.  Mr Hallam speculated the DPRK (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) had between 40 and 60 warheads.  He also said he believed it will be a while before North Korea hit its nuclear goals.  “I’m also inclined to think that it will be a while before they fit a 250Kt warhead to more than one or two rockets,” he said.  “So 38 North analysis being based to a large extent on smaller warheads is not unreasonable — but the number of larger warheads will clearly rise over time.”  Mr Hallam said it was reasonable to assume Seoul and Tokyo were obvious targets but the analysis didn’t include an ability to strike US west coast cities.  “If that ability does exist, then it’s also possible for them to strike Sydney, which doesn’t mean they necessarily will — the highest priority target in Australia, indeed almost in the world — is Pine Gap, critical for US command and control,” he said.  “If US cities become part of the equation which they will in a year or two if they are not now, then that body count will be higher.”  He also pointed out the analysis didn’t take into account US President Donald Trump’s threat to wipe out the DPRK, which would increase the body count even further.  Mr Hallam said there would also be fallout which would also add to the huge casualty toll.  “It would be necessary to take into account the effects of fallout drifting in one direction all over South Korea, and in the other direction, into Manchuria,” he said.  “Maybe once Seoul has been leveled, which can be done without use of nukes at all, a little fallout from the rubble bouncing in the DPRK is of lesser consequence, but it needs to be taken into account somehow.”  Meanwhile Mr Trump said his administration’s goal was for North Korea to denuclearise.  “We cannot allow this dictatorship to threaten our nation or our allies with unimaginable loss of life,” he said.  “We will do what we must do to prevent that from happening. And it will be done, if necessary, believe me.”  The President had been discussing Iran and North Korea with US military leaders and posed for a photo with them before declaring the moment “the calm before the storm”.  “You guys know what this represents?” Mr Trump said after journalists gathered in the White House state dining room to photograph him and First Lady Melania Trump with the uniformed military leaders and their spouses.  “Maybe it’s the calm before the storm,” he said.  When asked what storm, Mr Trump replied: “You’ll find out.”  - with Reuters  This story originally appeared in news.com.au.",20.0,34.0

The lawsuit was filed on behalf of members of the American military who were injured or killed by attacks between 2005 and 2009, at the height of the Iraq War. It accuses five companies — American firms General Electric, Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer and European drugmakers AstraZeneca and Roche Holding A.G. — of winning contracts to sell their products to the Iraqi Ministry of Health with the understanding that they also provide additional medical supplies and medicines for free.  At the time, the health ministry was controlled by followers of Moktada al-Sadr, a firebrand cleric and the leader of the Mahdi Army, whose death squads against Iraqi Sunnis also brought the country to the brink of civil war. The lawsuit claims Mr. Sadr’s lieutenants sold the samples on Iraq’s black market to fund their attacks on American forces.  As evidence, the lawsuit cited contracts between the companies and the Iraqi government, leaked diplomatic cables, press accounts and the testimony of informants.

766,2181,7,20,2017,2017-07-20,Vox,There’s a highly successful treatment for opioid addiction. But stigma is holding it back.,"“I’m sick of going to funerals.”  If you ask Jordan Hansen why he changed his mind on medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction, this is the bottom line.  Several years ago, Hansen was against the form of treatment. If asked back then what he thought about it, he would have told you that it’s ineffective — and even harmful — for drug users. Like other critics, to Hansen, medication-assisted treatment was nothing more than substituting one drug (say, heroin) with another (methadone).  Today, not only does Hansen think this form of treatment is effective, but he readily argues — as the scientific evidence overwhelmingly shows — that it’s the best form of treatment for opioid addiction. He believes this so strongly, in fact, that he now often leads training sessions for medication-assisted treatment across the country.  “It almost hurts to say it out loud now, but it’s the truth,” Hansen told me, describing his previous beliefs. “I was kind of absorbing the collective fear and ignorance from the culture at large within the recovery community.”  Hansen is far from alone. Over the past few years, America’s harrowing opioid epidemic — now the deadliest drug overdose crisis in the country’s history — has led to a lot of rethinking about how to deal with addiction. For addiction treatment providers, that’s led to new debates about the merits of the abstinence-only model — many of which essentially consider addiction a failure of willpower — so long supported in the US.  Related How to stop the deadliest drug overdose crisis in American history  The Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation, which Hansen works for, exemplifies the debate. As one of the top drug treatment providers in the country, it used to subscribe almost exclusively to the abstinence-only model, based on an interpretation of the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous popularized in American addiction treatment in the past several decades. But in 2012, Hazelden announced a big switch: It would provide medication-assisted treatment.  “This is a huge shift for our culture and organization,” Marvin Seppala, chief medical officer of Hazelden, said at the time. “We believe it’s the responsible thing to do.”  From the outside, this might seem like a bizarre debate: Okay, so addiction treatment providers are supporting a form of treatment that has a lot of evidence behind it. So what?  But the growing embrace of medication-assisted treatment is demonstrative of how the opioid epidemic is forcing the country to take another look at its inadequate drug treatment system. With so many people dying from drug overdoses — tens of thousands a year — and hundreds of thousands more expected to die in the next decade, America is finally considering how its response to addiction can be better rooted in science instead of the moralistic stigmatization that’s existed for so long.  The problem is that the moralistic stigmatization is still fairly entrenched in how the US thinks about addiction. But the embrace of medication-assisted treatment shows that may be changing — and America may be finally looking at addiction as a medical condition instead of a moral failure.  The research is clear: Medication-assisted treatment works  One of the reasons opioid addiction is so powerful is that users feel like they must keep using the drugs in order to stave off withdrawal. Once a person’s body grows used to opioids but doesn’t get enough of the drugs to satisfy what it’s used to, withdrawal can pop up, causing, among other symptoms, severe nausea and full-body aches. So to avoid suffering through it, drug users often seek out drugs like heroin and opioid painkillers — not necessarily to get a euphoric high, but to feel normal and avoid withdrawal. (In the heroin world, this is often referred to as “getting straight.”)  Medications like methadone and buprenorphine (also known as Suboxone) can stop this cycle. Since they are opioids themselves, they can fulfill a person’s cravings and stop withdrawal symptoms. The key is that they do this in a safe medical setting, and when taken as prescribed do not produce the euphoric high that opioids do when they are misused. By doing this, an opioid user significantly reduces the risk of relapse, since he doesn’t have to worry about avoiding withdrawal anymore. Users can take this for the rest of their lives, or in some cases, doses may be reduced; it varies from patient to patient.  The research backs this up: Various studies, including systematic reviews of the research, have found that medication-assisted treatment can cut the all-cause mortality rate among addiction patients by half or more. Just imagine if a medication came out for any other disease — and, yes, health experts consider addiction a disease — that cuts mortality by half; it would be a momentous discovery.  “That is shown repeatedly,” Maia Szalavitz, a longtime addiction journalist and author of Unbroken Brain: A Revolutionary New Way of Understanding Addiction, told me. “There’s so much data from so many different places that if you add methadone or Suboxone in, deaths go down, and if you take it away, deaths go up.”  That’s why the biggest public health organizations — including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and the World Health Organization — all acknowledge medication-assisted treatment’s medical value. And experts often describe it as “the gold standard” for opioid addiction care.  The data is what drove Hansen’s change in perspective. “If I wanted to view myself as an ethical practitioner and doing the best that I could for the people I served, I needed to make this change based on the overwhelming evidence,” he said. “And I needed to separate that from my personal recovery experience.”  Medication-assisted treatment is different from traditional forms of dealing with addiction in America, which tend to demand abstinence. The standards in this field are 12-step programs, which combine spiritual and moralistic ideals into a support group for people suffering from addiction. While some 12-step programs allow medication-assisted treatment, others prohibit it as part of their demand for total abstinence. The research shows this is a particularly bad idea for opioids, for which medications are considered the standard of care.  There are different kinds of medications for opioids, which will work better or worse depending on a patient’s circumstances. Methadone, for example, is only administered in a clinic, typically one to four times a day — but that means patients will have to make the trip to a clinic on a fairly regular basis. Buprenorphine is a take-home drug that’s taken once or twice a day, but the at-home access also means it might be easier to misuse and divert to the black market.  One rising medication, known as extended-release naltrexone or its brand name Vivitrol, isn’t an opioid — making it less prone to misuse — and only needs to be injected once a month. But it also requires full detoxification to use (usually three to 10 days of no opioid use), while buprenorphine only requires a partial detoxification process (usually 12 hours to two days). And instead of preventing withdrawal — indeed, the detox process requires going through withdrawal — it blocks the effects of opioids up to certain doses, making it much harder to get high or overdose on the drugs.  The first US-based study comparing naltrexone and buprenorphine found that once people get on either, they are similarly effective. But that comes with a major caveat: It was much harder to get people started on naltrexone than buprenorphine because naltrexone requires a detox period. So buprenorphine is, on average, more accessible and effective than naltrexone — although results can vary from individual to individual.  One catch is that even these medications, though the best forms of opioid addiction treatment, do not work for as much as 40 percent of opioid users. Some patients may prefer not to take any medications because they see any drug use whatsoever as getting in the way of their recovery, in which case total abstinence may be the right answer for them. Others may not respond well physically to the medications, or the medications may for whatever reason fail to keep them from misusing drugs.  This isn’t atypical in medicine. What works for some people, even the majority, isn’t always going to work for everyone. So these are really first-line treatments, but in some cases patients may need alternative therapies if medication-assisted treatment doesn’t work. (That might even involve prescription heroin — which, while it’s perhaps counterintuitive, the research shows it works to mitigate the problems of addiction when provided in tightly controlled, supervised medical settings.)  Medication can also be paired with other kinds of treatment to better results. It can be used in tandem with cognitive behavioral therapy or similar approaches, which teach drug users how to deal with problems or settings that can lead to relapse. All of that can also be paired with 12-step programs like AA and NA or other support groups in which people work together and hold each other accountable in the fight against addiction. It all varies from patient to patient.  Why medication-assisted treatment is not just replacing one drug with another  The main criticism of medication-assisted treatment is that it’s merely replacing one drug with another. Former Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price echoed this criticism, saying, “If we’re just substituting one opioid for another, we’re not moving the dial much. Folks need to be cured so they can be productive members of society and realize their dreams.” (A spokesperson for Price later walked back the statement, saying Price supports all kinds of treatment.)  On its face, this argument is true. Medication-assisted treatment is replacing one drug, whether it’s opioid painkillers or heroin, with another, such as methadone or buprenorphine.  But this isn’t by itself a bad thing.  Under the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, it’s not enough for someone to be using or even physically dependent on drugs to qualify for a substance use disorder, the technical name for addiction. After all, most US adults use drugs — some every day or multiple times a day — without any problems whatsoever. Just think about that next time you sip a beer, glass of wine, coffee, tea, or any other beverage with alcohol or caffeine in it, or any time you use a drug to treat a medical condition.  The qualification for a substance use disorder is that someone is using drugs in a dangerous or risky manner. So someone with an opioid use disorder would not just be using opioids but potentially using these drugs in a way that puts him or others in danger — perhaps by feeling the need to commit crimes to obtain the drugs or using the drugs so much that he puts himself at risk of overdose and inhibits his day-to-day functioning. Basically, the drug use has to hinder someone from being a healthy, functioning member of society to qualify as addiction.  The key with medication-assisted treatment is that while it does involve continued drug use, it turns that drug use into a much safer habit. So instead of stealing to get heroin or using painkillers so much that he puts his life at risk, a patient on medication-assisted treatment can simply use methadone or buprenorphine to meet his physical cravings and otherwise go about his day — going to school, work, or any other obligations.  Yet this myth of the dangers of medication-assisted treatment remains prevalent — to deadly results.  In 2013, Judge Frank Gulotta Jr. in New York ordered an opioid user arrested for drugs, Robert Lepolszki, off methadone treatment, which he began after his arrest. In January 2014, Lepolszki died of a drug overdose at 28 years old — a direct result, Lepolszki’s parents say, of failing to get the medicine he needed. In his defense, Gulotta has continued to argue that methadone programs “are crutches — they are substitutes for drugs and drug cravings without enabling the participant to actually rid him or herself of the addiction.”  This is just one case, but it shows the real risk of denying opioid users medication: It can literally get them killed by depriving them of lifesaving medical care.  The myth is also a big reason why there are still restrictions on medication-assisted treatment. For example, the federal government still caps how many patients doctors can prescribe buprenorphine to, with strict rules about raising the cap. This limits how accessible the treatment is. A HuffPost analysis found that even if every doctor who can prescribe buprenorphine did so at the maximum rate in 2012, more than half of Americans with opioid use disorders could not get the medication.  That’s on top of barriers to addiction treatment in general. According to a 2016 report by the surgeon general, just 10 percent of Americans with a drug use disorder obtain specialty treatment. The report attributed the low rate to severe shortages in the supply of care — which can lead to waiting periods of weeks or even months.  The medications used in treatment do carry some risks  None of this is to say that the medications used in these treatments are without any problems whatsoever.  Methadone is tied to some misuse and thousands of deadly overdoses a year — although mostly when it’s used for pain, not addiction, treatment, because it’s more regulated in addiction care.  Buprenorphine is safer in that, unlike common painkillers, heroin, and methadone, its effect has a ceiling — meaning it has no significant effect after a certain dose level. But it’s still possible to misuse, particularly for people with lower tolerance levels. And there are some reports of buprenorphine mills, where patients can get buprenorphine for misuse from unscrupulous doctors — similar to how pill mills popped up during the beginning of the opioid epidemic and provided patients easy access to painkillers.  Naltrexone, meanwhile, can heighten the risk of overdose and death in case of full relapse. Overdose and death are risks in any case of relapse, but they’re particularly acute for naltrexone because it requires a full detox process that eliminates prior tolerance. (Although this would typically require someone to stop taking naltrexone, since otherwise it blocks the effects of opioids up to certain doses.)  But when taken as prescribed, the medications are broadly safe and effective for addiction treatment. For regulators, it’s a matter of making sure the drugs aren’t diverted into misuse, while also providing good access to people who genuinely need them.  The fight over medication-assisted treatment is really about how we see addiction  Behind the arguments about medication-assisted treatment is a simple reality of how Americans view addiction: Many still don’t see it, as public health officials and experts do, as a disease.  With other diseases, there is no question that medication can be a legitimate answer. That medication is not viewed as a proper answer by many to addiction shows that people believe addiction is unique in some way — particularly, they view addiction as at least partly a moral failing instead of just a disease.  I get emails all the time to this effect. Here, for example, is a fairly representative reader message: “Darwin’s Theory says ‘survival of the fittest.’ Let these lost souls pay the price of their criminal choices and criminal actions. Society does not owe them multiple medical resuscitations from their own bad judgment, criminal activity, and self-inflicted wounds.”  This contradicts what addiction experts broadly agree on. As Stanford psychiatrist and Drug Dealer, MD author Anna Lembke put it, “If you see somebody who continues to use despite their lives being totally destroyed — losing their jobs, losing loved ones, ending up in jail — nobody would choose that. Nobody anywhere would ever choose that life. So clearly it is beyond this individual’s control on some level.”  Many Americans may understand this with, say, depression and anxiety. We know that people with these types of mental health problems are not in full control of their thoughts and emotions. But many don’t realize that addiction functions in a similar way — only that the thoughts and emotions drive someone to seek out drugs at just about any cost.  Some of the sentiment against medications, as Hansen can testify, is propagated by people suffering from addiction. Some of them believe that any drug use, even to treat addiction, goes against the goal of full sobriety. They may believe that if they got sober without medications, perhaps others should too. Many of them also don’t trust the health care system: If they got addicted to drugs because a doctor prescribed them opioid painkillers, they have a good reason to distrust doctors who are now trying to get them to take another medication — this time for their addiction.  The opioid epidemic, however, has gotten a lot of people in the addiction recovery world to reconsider their past beliefs. Funeral after funeral and awful statistic after awful statistic, there is a sense that there has to be a better way — and by looking at the evidence, many have come to support medication-assisted treatment.  “I remember sitting there,” Hansen said, speaking to his experience at a funeral, as a mother sang her dead son a lullaby, “thinking that we have to do better.”",5.0,11.0
1579,3266,11,9,2017,2017-11-09,Associated Press News,Pacific trade pact leaders due to meet on new deal," Leaders of the countries participating in a Pacific Rim trade pact abandoned by President Donald Trump have agreed to meet and are expected to endorse a basic agreement on moving ahead without the U.S.  Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said Friday that he was “reasonably confident” the 11 countries remaining in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which include Malaysia, would have a basic agreement.  They are trying to find a way forward without the U.S., the biggest economy and before Trump took office one of its most assertive supporters. Trump has said he prefers country-to-country deals and is seeking to renegotiate several major trade agreements to, as he says, “put America First.”  Najib’s comments to a business conference on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum followed conflicting reports that a basic agreement had been reached in the wee hours Friday.  Najib said officials met until 3 a.m. Friday trying to bridge their differences and produce a statement for the leaders of their countries to endorse.  “I am quite sanguine we will get a deal but of course it has to go through a process of ratification and some side matters have to be worked out, but at least we have managed to salvage some kind of free trade agreement, which is important for the future of APEC,” Najib said.  Vietnamese officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The negotiations are being held in Danang, Vietnam, alongside meetings of the 21-member APEC’s annual summit, where Trump’s markedly different stance from past U.S. leaders was being felt even before his arrival Friday in the coastal resort city.  While most APEC members say they remain committed to their multi-country approach in weaving their economies ever closer together, many acknowledge that open trade is a mixed bag: Not everyone benefits equally.  The U.S. pushback on “free trade,” evidenced in Trump’s “America First” policy, has raised eyebrows in the region after decades of U.S. pressure on opening markets.  While APEC operates by consensus and customarily issues nonbinding statements, TPP commitments would eventually be ratified and enforced by its members.  But even talks this week on a declaration to cap this week’s APEC summit had to be extended for an extra half-day as ministers haggled over wording. It’s unclear what the exact sticking points were, but officials have alluded to differences over the unequal impact more open trade has had on workers and concerns over automation in manufacturing that could leave many millions in a wide array of industries with no work to do.  Vietnamese Trade Minister Tran Tuan Anh said a “new trend of protectionism” was afoot, but the group eventually managed to bridge their differences.  As a developing country with a fast-growing export sector, Vietnam has a strong interest in open trade and access for its exports to consumers in the West. The summit is an occasion for its leaders to showcase the progress its economy has made thanks largely to foreign investment and trade. Danang, Vietnam’s third largest city, is in the midst of a construction boom as dozens of resorts and smaller hotels pop up along its scenic coastline.  But even though its economy grew at a brisk 6.2 percent pace last year, Vietnam’s GDP per capita is still one of the lowest among APEC members at less than $2,200. Many of its 95 million people remain poor and vulnerable to natural disasters such as storms that lashed the coast near Danang just days before the APEC meetings.  APEC’s members are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, the U.S. and Vietnam.",1.0,4.0
1053,2631,10,26,2017,2017-10-26,Fox News,Trump declares opioid crisis a 'public health emergency',"Calling it a “national shame” and “human tragedy,” President Trump on Thursday declared the opioid epidemic crippling American communities a “public health emergency” and pledged federal resources to help combat the growing problem.  “Addressing it will require all of our effort, and it will require us to confront the crisis in all of its real complexity,” Trump said during a speech in the East Room of the White House.  “As Americans, we cannot allow this to continue,” Trump said. “It is time to liberate our communities from the scourge. ... We can be the generation that ends the opioid epidemic.”  Trump spoke to an audience at the White House that included family members of those affected by the opioid crisis, as well as several administration officials and elected leaders.  The president, who said “not one part of American society has been spared” from the crisis, stopped short of calling it a national emergency, something he previously promised he’d do. The announcement follows months of debate on how to tackle the problem.  'We can be the generation that ends the opioid epidemic.' — President Trump  Trump himself has gone on record more than once saying he would declare the crisis a national emergency. Such a designation would allow states to tap into the same federal funds typically reserved for natural disasters like hurricanes through the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act.  HERE'S WHAT A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY MEANS  Instead, Trump signed a presidential memo that directs acting Health and Human Services Secretary Eric Hargan to declare a public health emergency under the Public Health Services Act -- which directs federal agencies to provide more grant money to combat the epidemic.  White House officials say the step helps cut through regulatory red tape and gives states more flexibility in how they use federal funds to fight the problem.  The designation will also allow changes such as expanded access to medical services in rural areas.  It doesn’t, however, create any additional funding.  The emergency declaration will last 90 days but can be renewed.  In 2015, 33,091 people died from opioid overdose, while 12.5 million people misused prescription opioids, according to the most recent statistics available from the Department of Health and Human Services.  The president on Thursday also revealed plans to take an “evil” opioid off the market immediately as well as the government’s intention to bring lawsuits against some of the drug makers, though he did not provide specifics. He also vowed to crack down on heroin imports from Mexico and fentanyl imports from China.  Pharmaceutical fentanyl is an opiate drug that’s up to 100 times more potent than morphine. In the past, drug dealers used it to spike the potency of the heroin they sold but traffickers are now selling fentanyl by itself.  Drug deaths involving fentanyl increased nearly 600 percent from 2014 to 2016, The Washington Post reported. There were 582 fatal overdoses linked to the synthetic drug in 2014. Last year, the number jumped to 3,946.  Trump also discussed the alcohol addiction that claimed his older brother Fred’s life in 1981.  “[Fred] had a problem with alcohol, and he would tell me, ‘Don’t drink, don’t drink,’” Trump said.  The president said watching his brother as well as other friends struggle with addiction is what set him on a no-drug, no-alcohol, no-cigarette path.  “There is nothing desirable about drugs,” Trump said. “They’re bad.”  Trump vowed to tackle the opioid crisis on the campaign trail, but critics claim his administration has been slow to act.  Trump created a presidential commission that in August recommended he declare the crisis a national emergency.  “Your declaration would empower your Cabinet to take bold steps and would force Congress to focus on funding and empowering the executive branch even further to deal with this loss of life,” the Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis wrote. “It would also awaken every American to this simple fact: If this scourge has not found you or your family yet, without bold action by everyone, it soon will.”  However, White House officials told reporters Thursday morning that a national emergency declaration was not necessary in the case of opioids.  The public health emergency will ""reorient all of the federal government and executive branch resources toward focusing on providing relief to this urgent need.”  Past instances of public health emergencies include the H1N1 influenza outbreak in 2009.  Since the commission released its report, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price has stepped down from his post while Trump’s pick for drug czar, Rep. Tom Marino, withdrew his nomination.  At an event at the Heritage Foundation earlier Thursday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said it’s important to “reestablish the view that people should say no to drugs.”  “I do think this whole country needs to not be so lackadaisical about drugs,” he said. “Much of the addiction starts with marijuana. It is not a harmless drug.”",20.0,24.0

Like what you’re reading? Sign up to get VoxCare in your inbox here.  President Donald Trump keeps insisting: He does not want health insurers to get an Obamacare bailout.  I am supportive of Lamar as a person & also of the process, but I can never support bailing out ins co's who have made a fortune w/ O'Care. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2017  Trump is referring here to Obamacare's cost-sharing reduction subsidies. These are payments the federal government sends to insurance companies to subsidize co-payments and deductibles for low-income enrollees.  Trump announced last week he would stop making these payments. But let's be clear: That decision will cause the federal government to spend billions more subsidizing insurance companies, not less.  The reasons for this are complex. I want to walk through them clearly because it shows who gets hurt by the Trump decision, who (surprisingly) gets helped, and how the government can end up spending more money by ending a subsidy program.  Obamacare has two different subsidy programs.  Premium subsidies reduce the cost of monthly premiums for Obamacare enrollees who earn less than 400 percent of the federal poverty line. These subsidies are structured so that an individual is only expected to pay a certain percentage of her income on monthly premiums. Someone who has earnings at 200 percent of the federal poverty line (about $24,000) is only expected to spend 4 percent of her income on premiums. That works out to $80 per month. The government pays the rest. The actual price of insurance is irrelevant to this enrollee (although it matters a great deal to the federal government, which is picking up a bigger tab when premiums are higher.) Trump has not touched these subsidies. Cost-sharing reduction subsidies reduce copayments and deductibles for a smaller group of Obamacare enrollees. They only go to people who earn less than 250 percent of the federal poverty line (as opposed to the premium subsidies, which go up to 400 percent). This population gets premium subsidies and cost-sharing reduction subsidies. The idea behind this subsidy program is to make sure that low-income Americans can actually afford to see a doctor when they gain coverage.  Trump has said he will discontinue the second subsidy program. But insurance companies are still required by law to provide these subsidies to their low-income enrollees. They cannot jack up the deductibles on someone who earns 200 percent of the poverty line, even though the government has stopped providing the money.  Insurance companies don't want to lose money. They need a way to offset the sudden loss of billions in government funds. So, they looked for other levers to pull. And many settled on raising premiums as a way to recoup those lost funds.  As Dylan Scott wrote in a longer piece this morning, many insurers tacked on anywhere between a 10 and 30 percent premium increase to account for this loss of funds.  And that takes us back to the first subsidy program. When premiums go up, it means that the federal government has to spend more money on subsidies. It has to spend a lot more money on subsidies because that program covers people with higher incomes.  This is how ending the cost-sharing reduction program actually increases federal spending on insurance subsidies. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the decision will lead to $194 billion more sent from the federal government to subsidize the health plans that participate in Obamacare.  This also means that the people who receive cost-sharing reduction subsidies are still going to get them. Health plans understand they are required to make those payments. I haven't heard a single one say that they are going to suddenly pull away the co-payment and deductible subsidies from their low-income customers. They will make those payments — they will just jack up their premiums in order to have the money to do so.  The people who will be most hurt by this action are, somewhat ironically, high-income Obamacare enrollees. People who do not receive federal subsidies have to pay the full cost of their premium increase. If premiums go up by double digits, people above the cut off for subsidies (400 percent of the poverty line) will have to pay that double-digit increases.  Some states are doing creative things to prevent these situations (limiting the premium increases, for example, to the plans that people with subsidies are likely to buy). But some states aren't. And in those places, some people might lose insurance.  CBO estimates that insurance coverage will decline by 1 million with the end of the cost-sharing subsidies.  The Trump administration is not ending insurance subsidies. Instead, they have created a policy where they spend more money to insure fewer people — something you probably won't see on the president's Twitter feed.  vox-mark VoxCare Vox's email explaining the biggest news in health care, edited by Sarah Kliff Subscribe By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy.

Trey Gowdy, R-S.C. said Comey needs to testify before Congress again.  Gowdy, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee and a member of the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committee, told Fox News’ Bret Baier on “Special Report” Tuesday night that “for a number of reasons” Comey should return to Capitol Hill and the committees needed to further examine the FBI memos before he did.  “Whenever somebody decides to charge someone, there are lots of layers of scrutiny. When you decide not to charge someone, there aren’t that many layers of scrutiny but there ought to be at least a couple,” Gowdy said. “The media should do it but also Congress should look at this decision not to charge and whether or not it was made before you interviewed two dozen witnesses, including the target of the investigation, yeah we need to talk to him again.”  COMEY INSISTED NO ‘SPECIAL’ RULES IN FBI CLINTON PROBE – WHILE DRAFTING ‘EXONERATION STATEMENT’  According to Gowdy, the timeline of events and some of Comey’s decisions along the way did not appear to add up. He was referring to Comey’s statement during his June congressional testimony in which he said the tarmac meeting between former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton encouraged him to announce his findings in the email investigation.  “His ostensible reason for taking that decision away from the Department of Justice was that meeting on the tarmac but yet a month and a half earlier he is memorializing a decision he’s already made so the chronology does not add up,” Gowdy said. “His answers have been all over the map.”  Gowdy also told the Fox News anchor that he not only wants to talk to Comey, but also plans to speak to his former colleagues.  When asked whether Loretta Lynch, who is expected to be on Capitol Hill Friday concerning the Russia investigation, would be asked about Comey’s email draft, Gowdy said she would not.  COMEY DRAFTED LETTER ON CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION BEFORE COMPLETING INTERVIEWS, FBI CONFIRMS  But he said there were “lots of reasons” to talk to her as well, in that she could “corroborate or contradict Comey’s recollection” about their conversation regarding his decision to make the announcement.  Baier’s interview also touched on Gowdy’s investigation into Samantha Power, the former ambassador to the United Nations during the Obama administration, and her office’s request to unmask at least 260 individuals heard on surveillance recordings.  Gowdy said during questioning, Power testified that she had not personally made all of the requests, despite them being filed under her name. He said the committee had to find out whether someone else in the intelligence community was actually behind those requests.",18.0,17.0

The new Republican tax plan includes just such language, about a provision that wealthier Americans might find tempting to abuse.  “The framework contemplates that the committees will adopt measures to prevent the recharacterization of personal income into business income to prevent wealthy individuals from avoiding the top personal tax rate,” says the tax reform blueprint presented on Wednesday by congressional Republicans and the Trump administration.  It is an important asterisk to one of the core elements of the plan: a desire to tax income of “pass-through” businesses such as partnerships at a rate of only 25 percent. Currently, such income is taxed at the owners’ individual income tax rate, which is as high as 39.6 percent (and would fall to 35 percent in the Republican plan). The Republicans want the pass-through businesses to have a tax rate more in line with that of big, C-class corporations (which they are proposing to tax at 20 percent).  But that vague language about the framework contemplating committees adopting measures shows that a fundamental question about this change remains unanswered.",13.0,15.0

Speaking by phone to Breitbart News on Saturday, Corfman’s mother, Nancy Wells, 71, further stated that her daughter would not have come forward if it weren’t for The Post reporter’s alleged actions.  Earlier on Sunday, Breitbart News reported that Corfman’s mother contradicted a key detail of Corfman’s story. Speaking by phone to Breitbart News on Saturday, Wells said that her daughter did not have a phone in her bedroom during the period that Moore is reported to have allegedly called Corfman – purportedly on Corfman’s bedroom phone – to arrange at least one encounter.  The Washington Post cited Corfman as remembering that she provided Moore with her number when she was 14. She said that she spoke to Moore from what she described as the phone in her bedroom.  Today, the left got some very bad new about their hit job on Roy Moore…it appears that polls show Alabama voters aren’t buying it…  Breitbart News – Two new polls demonstrate that GOP nominee for the U.S. Senate Judge Roy Moore remains unaffected entirely by smears in the Washington Post against him, and his lead before the Post piece on Thursday afternoon remains intact.  One of the polls, which were both provided by the pollster to Breitbart News exclusively on Saturday evening, was conducted on Thursday morning before the publication of the Post piece that afternoon. The second one was conducted on Saturday evening. Together, they show Judge Moore’s lead over Democrat Doug Jones has been virtually unaffected since the Post story came out.  The first survey, which was conducted entirely before noon local time on Thursday, shows Moore leading Jones by 50 percent to 39.2 percent with 10.8 percent undecided. That survey of 1,354 likely voters in the upcoming Dec. 12 special election has a margin of error of 3.5 percent.  The second survey, conducted Saturday evening—two days after the Post piece hit, roiling Alabama’s political scene—shows Moore and Jones with about the exact same percentages as before. Moore’s position in this second poll is 49.8 percent—meaning he only dropped 0.2 percent since the story hit—and Jones has only picked up 0.4 percent to reach 39.6 percent total. The second survey, which polled 1,536 likely voters with a margin of error of 3.3 percent, has 10.5 percent as undecided.  “The polling between Thursday morning and Saturday showed far less movement than I originally expected,” pollster John Wahl told Breitbart News. “The controversy surrounding the Washington Post article seems to have galvanized the support of both candidates, but not changed the actual percentages in a significant manner. The Moore campaign has already weathered a considerable amount of political attacks during this campaign season, and I expect most of his lightest support to have blown off during these attacks. His current support level is holding fairly steady.”  Another liberal publication, The Hill, reported that Moore was losing in the polls to Jones after the hit piece on Moore was published in the Washington Post.  The Hill -Democrat Doug Jones is leading Republican Roy Moore in Alabama’s Senate race in the wake of explosive accusations of sexual misconduct against Moore, according to a new poll released Sunday.  Forty-six percent of likely voters polled said they would vote for Jones, while 42 percent said they would vote for Moore, according to the Louisiana-based JMC Analytics and Polling.  The survey was conducted on Nov. 9 and Nov. 11, after The Washington Post reported that a woman said Moore had initiated a sexual encounter with her in 1979, when she was 14 years old and he was 32.  The RealClearPolitics poll has Moore and Jones tied.  The poll showing Moore losing to Jones was conducted by JMP, the same polling operation who gave us this hilariously inaccurate poll, only one week before the general election in 2016:  We’re gonna go out on a limb, and say that this so-called scandal involving Judge Roy Moore is going to backfire spectacularly on the left, and will ultimately only shine a spotlight on the hypocrisy of the Democrat Party, who ignored the sexual misconduct of former President Bill Clinton and his enabling wife, Hillary Clinton for decades.",1.0,1.0
1428,3048,11,3,2017,2017-11-03,Breitbart,Tesla Stock Plunges $5.5B as Model 3 Suffers 6-Month Delay,"The value of Tesla Inc. stock plunged by about $5.4 billion over a 48-hour period this week as the company declared a large quarterly loss and finally acknowleded that deliveries of its high-volume Model 3 will be delayed by at least 6 months.  Tesla (OTC: TSLA) has only made a profit in one quarter of its 14-year existence, and that was only due to selling federal and state tax credits to traditional auto manufactures and others that actually do make taxable profits.  Although Tesla’s $2.98 billion third quarter revenue slightly beat Wall Street analysts’ estimates, the company lost $671 million, or $2.92 per share. That was twice the-$336 million loss in the prior quarter, and set an all-time cash burn high of $16 million per day.  Breitbart News reported in early October that CEO Elon Musk had announced that Tesla Inc. had its “all-time best quarter” with record deliveries of 26,150 vehicles, including 14,065 Model S sedans; 11,865 Model X SUVs; and 220 Model 3 economy cars. That was considered a disappointment for Model 3 deliveries, and its stock sold off by 1 percent.  But Musk emphasized that through “physics-first principles,” Tesla would shape a new mode of industrial production to improve efficiency by “factors of 10 or even 100 times.” He said Tesla’s key advantage in building all-electric vehicles was limiting the number of moving engine parts to 20, versus up to 10,000 for internal combustion engines.  With investors reassured that Tesla was on track to ramp up to delivering 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week in the December quarter and 10,000 per week in the March quarter, Tesla’s stock traded up on big volume to an interim high of $362.55 on October 18.  But the stock opened at $301.15 per share on November 2 and has been trading down after Musk acknowledged on the company’s third quarter conference call that it is “difficult to predict” when the bottlenecks will be cleared in production of Model 3s. He said he did not expect to be at 5,000 Model 3 units a week until late March.  Musk tried to reassure shareholders that he is “leading from the front lines” to battle “production hell” delays. Tesla said the main problem holding up production of the Model 3s were production delays at Tesla’s $5 billion Gigafactory in Reno, Nevada, where Panasonic four-battery cell modules are automatically inserted into an aluminum-wrapped battery case. Musk referred to his Instagram post last week where he is having a late-night campfire with a couple of managers on the Gigafactory’s roof as a sign of his focus.  Musk did assign some blame for production delays on the Model 3 being more automated, compared to the company’s largely hand-built luxury Model S sedans and Model X SUVs. Musk stated that “bringing this level of automation online is simply challenging in the early stages of the ramp.”  But he failed to comment on Edward Niedermeyer’s brilliant October 30 report in the Daily Kanban industrial blog that Tesla did not give a purchase order to a major automated tooling supplier to develop two “Body in White” (BIW) transfer lines for the Model 3 early this year. Although car companies normally place fully-designed orders for BIW lines with at least a two-year lead time, and BIW manufacturers almost always assemble and test the line at their factories, Tesla asked for a 4-month delivery and wanted to expedite delivery by doing a risky “cold build” line layout and quality testing at Tesla’s factory.  Niedermeyer added that “disagreements between Tesla’s designers and engineers resulted in numerous revisions to the scope of the contract and eventually led Tesla to drop the second line from its purchase order.” The BIW vendor blamed Tesla’s high level of turnover in key positions, which Breitbart News has highlighted in the past. Without the second BIW assembly line, Tesla can never produce 10,000 units per week.  In another example of Tesla failing to have enough lead time to produce Model 3 units, Panasonic’s Chief Executive Kazuhiro Tsuga told Reuters that Gigafactory batteries are still being mostly made by hand. “This process (for battery packs) will be soon automated, and then the number of vehicles to be produced will rise sharply.” Tsuga declined to comment on how far Tesla Model 3 production is behind its targeted delivery schedule.",5.0,1.0

NEW EVIDENCE SHOWS WOMAN Who Accused Roy Moore of Sexual Misconduct Worked For Hillary Campaign…Supported His Democrat Opponent On Facebook ,"Infowars uncovered a bombshell when they discovered the Facebook page of one of Judge Roy Moore’s accusers, Debbie Gibson, who came out in a Washington Post article to accuse him of sexual misconduct that allegedly took place 36 years ago.  Debbie Wesson Gibson says that she was 17 in the spring of 1981 when Moore spoke to her Etowah High School civics class about serving as the assistant district attorney. She says that when he asked her out, she asked her mother what she would say if she wanted to date a 34-year-old man. Gibson says her mother asked her who the man was, and when Gibson said “Roy Moore,” her mother said, “I’d say you were the luckiest girl in the world.” Among locals in Gadsden, a town of about 47,000 back then, Moore “had this godlike, almost deity status — he was a hometown boy made good,” Gibson says, “West Point and so forth.”  Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court? Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?  Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court? * Yes, he will be confirmed. No, he will not be confirmed.  Email *  Name     Gibson says that they dated for two to three months, and that he took her to his house, read her poetry and played his guitar. She says he kissed her once in his bedroom and once by the pool at a local country club. “Looking back, I’m glad nothing bad happened,” says Gibson, who now lives in Florida. “As a mother of daughters, I realize that our age difference at that time made our dating inappropriate.” Debbie Gibson hates Donald Trump, but that’s not all, she’s pretty fond of Judge Roy Moore’s opponent, Doug Ross for US Senate In Alabama as well…  Trending: AMERICA’S BIGGEST LOSER Explains Why Multiple Sexual Assault Claims Against Bill Clinton Are Not As Serious As Kavanaugh’s…Calls For CIVIL WAR! [VIDEO]  Here are a few anti-Trump posts that were found on Gibson’s Facebook page:  One of senatorial candidate Roy Moore’s accusers is apparently a fervent Democrat who has worked for the DNC as a sign language interpreter for Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden, a revelation which the Washington Post never included in its original report.  The accuser, Debbie Gibson, had also publically supported Moore’s opponent Doug Jones before the accusations came to light.  Gibson openly bragged about signing for Hillary during a campaign appearance. On a side note, we’re not sure who she’s signing for. The crowd behind Hillary, that is usually packed with the Democrats hand-picked “diverse” crowd, appears to be pretty thin.  Here’s a post from Gibson’s page proving that she’s supporting Judge Roy Moore’s Democrat opponent for US Senate:  She even posted a video of Moore’s opponent, Doug Jones to promote him to her friends on Facebook. The screenshot below shows the post on her page.  Interestingly, when attacking Moore ally Steve Bannon for suggesting the Washington Post was politically motivated in its reporting, the newspaper implied that Gibson wasn’t “down with Democratic propaganda,” a statement which seemingly conflicts with Gibson’s political activism:  That’s not what the photos say…  The Washington Post reported:  “According to campaign reports, none of the women has donated to or worked for Moore’s Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, or his rivals in the Republican primary…”  But notice the precise wording; it’s lawyer-speak. It might very well be true that Gibson didn’t donate or work for Doug Jones, but according to her Facebook profile, she did actively campaign for him, which doesn’t help her credibility and it should have been reported – yet the Washington Post conveniently left it out.",1.0,5.0
286,1618,10,5,2017,2017-10-05,Fox News,"Google exec discusses new Pixel devices, privacy, artificial intelligence and more","Google has stepped up the competition between itself and Apple and Amazon for consumers' hard-earned dollars, launching several new products, including the Pixel XL 2. While the products generally have similar features, the search giant is trying to use artificial intelligence as its hook.  At an event on Wednesday, Google CEO Sundar Pichai talked extensively about how the tech titan continues to transition from a ""mobile-first company"" to one that is putting artificial intelligence (AI) first.  In an interview with Fox News on Thursday, Google senior marketing executive Daniel Sieberg echoed those thoughts.  ""We're excited by these products because they combine hardware, software and artificial intelligence,"" Sieberg said. ""They're made by Google from the ground up and we thought about everything in the design here. The AI part is the part we hope will help enhance people's lives.""  GOOGLE UNVEILS NEW PIXEL PHONES, SMART SPEAKER AS TECH COMPETITION HEATS UP  In addition to announcing the highly-anticipated Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, Google unveiled the Pixelbook 2-in-1 computer, two new smart speakers, dubbed the Google Home Max and Home Mini, a new Daydream VR headset and a new wearable camera, known as Google Clips.  What follows below is a Q&A with Sieberg. It has been edited for brevity and clarity.  Fox News: Google is positioning itself as an AI first company, which is prevalent in every product announced yesterday, but Pixel sales are extremely low and Google Home is a distant second to Amazon's Echo lineup. What is the marketing push going to be like, telling consumers these products will supposedly make their lives easier?  Sieberg: We're excited by these products because they combine hardware, software and AI. They're made by Google from ground up. You could have a number of Minis in different rooms, at a cost of $49, and activate all of these features.  We thought about everything in the design here and we've taken care of every detail. The AI part, we hope it will help enhance people's lives.  Fox News: What's behind the push over the past couple of years to have Google really own building its own hardware? Google has dabbled with hardware in the past, but from the outside, it's never been seen as serious, especially with phones. Is there something that's changed inside the company that's led to this thinking?  Sieberg: We really think we can give the best experience to our consumers by being part of the entire process. Whether it's the software people use or the games they play, artificial intelligence is critically important.  ELON MUSK THINKS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE COULD CAUSE WORLD WAR 3  Going forward, it's going to be exceptionally important for Google and we think we can give people the best experience by doing this.  Fox News: A number of the products -- Pixel XL 2, Max, Pixel Buds and to some extent, PixelBook, seem geared towards the higher-end of their markets. What's behind those levels of pricing?  Sieberg: We hope there are a number of options for folks. The PixelBook is on the higher end. But it has a light weight, at just 1 kilogram (2.2 lbs.) and it has a very high screen resolution. We think that as people experience these Pixel devices, they'll want to do things like watch movies on it.  The bottom line is we want people to have a number of different options and whatever it is that makes sense for people's lives, we have.  Fox News: What's one example of AI being integrated into a product that was announced yesterday is going to blow people's minds?  Sieberg: Google Clips. You could position the camera in your living room or kitchen and it's intended for parents or pet owners. By the time you get your phone out to capture a cute event, it might be too late. Clips captures several seconds of video and thanks to machine learning and artificial intelligence, it identifies the people who are most important to you and records those moments. It leaves you free to be in the moment and not worry about grabbing your phone.  Fox News: Privacy is obviously an issue, especially with devices that can hear your every word, such as smart speakers. Amazon Echo's have already been hacked -- how do you try to address concerns about these new devices?  Sieberg: We're serious about addressing people's concerns about privacy. For the Home Max or Mini, you can turn microphone off if you want. We want to put that into people's hands. For Google Clips, the content is stored locally on the device. We want you as the user to decide where that content shows up and when it shows up.  Follow Chris Ciaccia on Twitter @Chris_Ciaccia",1.0,3.0
553,1945,10,13,2017,2017-10-13,Associated Press News,Trump lashes out at Puerto Rico as House passes aid package," In this Thursday, Sept. 28, 2017 file photo, destroyed communities are seen in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Toa Alta, Puerto Rico. The House is on track to backing President Donald Trump's request for billions more in disaster aid, $16 billion to pay flood insurance claims and emergency funding to help the cash-strapped government of Puerto Rico stay afloat. The hurricane aid package Thursday, Oct. 12, 2017, totals $36.5 billion and sticks close to a White House request, ignoring - for now - huge demands from the powerful Florida and Texas delegations, who together pressed for some $40 billion more. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump lashed out at hurricane-devastated Puerto Rico on Thursday, insisting in tweets that the federal government can’t keep sending help “forever” and suggesting the U.S. territory was to blame for its financial struggles.  His broadsides triggered an outcry from Democrats in Washington and officials on the island, which has been reeling since Hurricane Maria struck three weeks ago, leaving death and destruction in an unparalleled humanitarian crisis.  San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, with whom Trump has had a running war of words, tweeted that the president’s comments were “unbecoming” to a commander in chief and “seem more to come from a ‘Hater in Chief.’”  “Mr. President, you seem to want to disregard the moral imperative that your administration has been unable to fulfill,” the mayor said in a statement.  The debate played out as the House passed, on a sweeping 353-69 vote, a $36.5 billion disaster aid package that includes assistance for Puerto Rico’s financially-strapped government. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said the government needs to ensure that Puerto Rico can “begin to stand on its own two feet” and said the U.S. has “got to do more to help Puerto Rico rebuild its own economy.”  Wildfires that raged across California wine country left little more than smoldering ashes and eye-stinging smoke in their wake. House after house is gone, with only brick chimneys and charred laundry machines to mark what were once homes. (Oct. 11)  White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders praised the House action Thursday night and promised the administration “will continue to work with Congress to provide the resources necessary to recover and rebuild from the hurricanes” and the wildfires in California.  Forty-five deaths in Puerto Rico have been blamed on Maria, about 85 percent of Puerto Rico residents still lack electricity and the government says it hopes to have electricity restored completely by March.  Both Trump and Vice President Mike Pence visited the island last week to reaffirm the U.S. commitment to the island’s recovery. But Trump’s tweets Thursday raised questions about whether the U.S. would remain there for the long haul. He tweeted, “We cannot keep FEMA, the Military & the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever!”  In a series of tweets, the president added, “electric and all infrastructure was disaster before hurricanes.” He blamed Puerto Rico for its looming financial crisis and “a total lack of accountability.”  The tweets conflicted with Trump’s past statements on Puerto Rico. During an event last week honoring the heritage of Hispanics, for example, the president said, “We will be there all the time to help Puerto Rico recover, restore, rebuild.”  White House chief of staff John Kelly, speaking to reporters, said the military and other emergency responders were trying very hard to “work themselves out of a job.” Reassuring the island, Kelly said the U.S. will “stand with those American citizens in Puerto Rico until the job is done.”  At the Pentagon, Lt. Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr. told reporters “there’s still plenty of work to be done” by the military troops in Puerto Rico. He said there was no current plan to withdraw troops who are supporting FEMA’s recovery efforts. McKenzie, director of the military’s Joint Staff, said it will be up to FEMA and other civilian agencies to decide when the military is no longer needed there.  Democrats said Trump’s tweets were deplorable, given that the 3 million-plus U.S. citizens on Puerto Rico are confronting the kind of hardships that would draw howls of outrage if they affected a state. One-third of the island lacks clean running water and just 8 percent of its roads are passable, according to government statistics.  “It is shameful that President Trump is threatening to abandon these Americans when they most need the federal government’s help,” said Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer, the second-ranking House Democrat.  After years of economic challenges, Puerto Rico was already in the process of restructuring much of its $74 billion in debt before the hurricane struck. The financial situation is more complicated than Trump’s tweets suggest.  Puerto Rico lost population and jobs after Congress eliminated special tax breaks in 2006, making it more difficult to repay its debts. Yet lenders continued to extend credit to Puerto Rico despite its economic struggles, while pension costs strained Puerto Rico’s government and its infrastructure deteriorated.  The legislative aid package totals $36.5 billion and sticks close to a White House request. For now, it ignores huge demands from the powerful Florida and Texas delegations, which together pressed for some $40 billion more.  A steady series of disasters could put 2017 on track to rival Hurricane Katrina and other 2005 storms as the most costly set of disasters ever. Katrina required about $110 billion in emergency appropriations.  The bill combines $18.7 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency with $16 billion to permit the financially troubled federal flood insurance program pay an influx of Harvey-related claims. An additional $577 million would pay for western firefighting efforts.  Up to $5 billion of the FEMA money could be used to help local governments remain functional as they endure unsustainable cash shortfalls in the aftermath of Maria, which has choked off revenues and strained resources.  Ryan, the House speaker, planned to visit Puerto Rico on Friday. He has promised that the island will get what it needs.  “It’s not easy when you’re used to living in an American way of life, and then somebody tells you that you’re going to be without power for six or eight months,” said Resident Commissioner Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon, who represents Puerto Rico as a nonvoting member of Congress. “It’s not easy when you are continue to suffer — see the suffering of the people without food, without water, and actually living in a humanitarian crisis.”  ___  Associated Press writers Josh Boak and Robert Burns contributed to this report.",67.0,54.0

A Twitter account that tracks Wikipedia edits made from IP addresses in Congress first picked up the edits. The IP address, originating from the House of Representatives, started the series of edits at the entry for “solicitor,” with the next five edits being related to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The final edits in the series were related to Jack Ruby, the killer of Kennedy’s assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, a National Enquirer story subsequently referenced by Donald Trump accused Cruz’s father of being linked to Kennedy assassin Oswald.  Edits to Wikipedia from Congressional IPs have been the subject of considerable coverage and speculation as to the identities of the authors. As the account only detects IP addresses belonging to Congressional computers, the editor could be anyone from a lowly staffer to a sitting Congressperson or just someone who has managed to get access to an IP linked to Congress. In 2014, vandalism from Congressional IP addresses got so bad Wikipedia administrators banned the entire IP range belonging to Congress for ten days.  The identity of the IP users may be a mystery, but it seems some delight in the attention. After a recent BuzzFeed report suggested someone was trolling the Twitter account tracking congressional edits, a Congressional IP edited the Wikipedia article on BuzzFeed to say “They’ll never find me.” One Congressional IP has since edited the list of imposters on Wikipedia to add “Whoever else is making these edits” to the list and then claiming in another article that “Ted the Cat” was responsible.

CalFire spokesman Daniel Berlant said Monday, Oct. 23, 2017, the estimate of homes and structures destroyed was boosted from 6,900 late last week to 8,400 as officials neared completion of their damage assessment. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — A non-partisan federal watchdog says climate change is already costing U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars each year, with those costs expected to rise as devastating storms, floods, wildfires and droughts become more frequent in the coming decades.  A Government Accountability Office report released Monday said the federal government has spent more than $350 billion over the last decade on disaster assistance programs and losses from flood and crop insurance. That tally does not include the massive toll from this year’s wildfires and three major hurricanes, expected to be among the most costly in the nation’s history.  The Senate on Monday gave preliminary approval to a $36.5 billion hurricane relief package that would provide Puerto Rico with a much-needed infusion of cash and keep the federal flood insurance program from running out of money to pay claims from hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. That’s on top of another $15.3 billion aid package approved last month.  The report predicts these costs will only grow in the future, averaging a budget busting $35 billion each year by 2050 — a figure that recent history would suggest is a conservative estimate.  “Climate change impacts are already costing the federal government money, and these costs will likely increase over time as the climate continues to change,” the report said.  Calculating just how much of the spending from disasters is directly attributable to the changing climate is not possible, the report’s authors conclude, but the trend is clear: “The impacts and costs of extreme events — such as floods, drought and other events — will increase in significance as what are considered rare events become more common and intense because of climate change.”  The federal government doesn’t effectively plan for these recurring costs, the report said, classifying the financial exposure from climate-related costs as “high risk.”  “The federal government has not undertaken strategic government-wide planning to manage climate risks by using information on the potential economic effects of climate change to identify significant risks and craft appropriate federal responses,” the study said. “By using such information, the federal government could take the initial step in establishing government-wide priorities to manage such risks.”  GAO undertook the study following a request from Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.  “This nonpartisan GAO report Senator Cantwell and I requested contains astonishing numbers about the consequences of climate change for our economy and for the federal budget in particular,” said Collins. “In Maine, our economy is inextricably linked to the environment. We are experiencing a real change in the sea life, which has serious implications for the livelihoods of many people across our state, including those who work in our iconic lobster industry.”  The report’s authors reviewed 30 government and academic studies examining the national and regional impacts of climate change. They also interviewed 28 experts familiar with the strengths and limitations of the studies, which rely on future projections of climate impacts to estimate likely costs.  The report says the fiscal impacts of climate change are likely to vary widely by region. The Southeast is at increased risk because of coastal property that could be swamped by storm surge and sea level rise. The Northeast is also under threat from storm surge and sea level rise, though not as much as the Southeast.  The Midwest and Great Plains are susceptible to decreased crop yields, the report said. The West is expected to see increased drought, wildfires and deadly heatwaves.  Advance copies were provided to the White House and the Environmental Protection Agency, which provided no official comments for inclusion in the GAO report.  Requests for comment from The Associated Press also received no response on Monday.  President Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax, announcing his intent to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accords and revoke Obama-era initiatives to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Trump has also appointed officials such as EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, all of whom question the scientific consensus that carbon released into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels is the primary driver of global warming.  Earlier this month Trump nominated Kathleen Hartnett White of Texas to serve as his top environmental adviser at the White House. She has credited the fossil fuel industry with “vastly improved living conditions across the world” and likened the work of mainstream climate scientists to “the dogmatic claims of ideologues and clerics.”  White, who works at a conservative think tank that has received funding from fossil-fuel companies, holds academic degrees in East Asian studies and comparative literature.  ___  Follow Associated Press environmental writer Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck  ___  Submit a confidential tip to The Associated Press at https://www.ap.org.tips",5.0,8.0
1491,3159,11,7,2017,2017-11-07,Fox News,Veteran unemployment rates fall to record low in October,"The unemployment rate for military veterans in October reached a low of just 2.7 percent, continuing a long-term downward trend in unemployment among members of the U.S. Armed Services.  Mirroring October’s overall drop in unemployment, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the improved numbers offset a decline in September that largely reflected the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Harvey in Florida and Texas.  While the unemployment rate for veterans only dropped 0.3 percent between September and October, the rate was down from 4.3 percent in October 2016 and from almost 10 percent in 2010.  For veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan – referred to as post-9/11 veterans – the unemployment rate was 3.6 percent, compared to 4.7 percent in October 2016, and 10.2 percent in 2009.  The White House used the dropping unemployment rates -- overall jobless rate ticked down to a 17-year low of 4.1 percent in October – to tout President Trump’s plans to jump-start the economy.  ""Numbers are phenomenal over the last year — since November 8th, Election Day,” Trump told business leaders in Tokyo on Monday. “Our unemployment is at a 17-year low. We've gotten almost 2 million more people in the workforce in just that short period of time. I've reduced regulations terrifically, frankly, if I do say so myself.”  Observers, however, caution that the drop in unemployment is due in part to many Americans giving up searching for work — one of the criticisms Trump made of President Obama's record during the 2016 campaign. Many of the economic figures Trump cites are advancing a recovery from the Great Recession that dates back to the middle of 2009.  As for the stock market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average returned to its previous peak in March 2013 and has been setting records ever since. The promise of corporate tax cuts by Trump has helped the stock market, but many of the gains rest on the foundations of an economic recovery in which corporate profits climbed.

Mr. Trump has established an easy rapport with “Chuck and Nancy,” as he likes to call Mr. Schumer, a fellow New Yorker, and Ms. Pelosi, of California. The three bonded last month over a dinner of honey sesame crispy beef in the White House, and their discussions have gone beyond the fiscal deal and how to protect young immigrants brought to this country illegally from being deported.  They have prodded Mr. Trump to put aside the Republican credo of “repeal and replace” in favor of more modest tweaks to the existing law. They have urged him to preserve subsidies, known as cost-sharing reductions, paid to insurers under the health law to help low-income consumers pay for out-of-pocket health expenses like co-payments and deductibles.  But Mr. Schumer’s quick rebuff of Mr. Trump on Friday shows the limits of the partnership. The senator has said that much will depend on whether the president keeps his promise to protect the young undocumented immigrants who are beneficiaries of the program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.  “Whether he pivots or not will be one of the most fundamental questions of this administration,” Mr. Schumer said recently. “It’s the $64,000 question. The only way it can happen is if we have a successful negotiation on DACA, and secondly whether we get health care.”  The president’s call is sure to further rankle Republicans, with whom Mr. Trump has had increasingly tense relations over their failure to knock down a key pillar of Mr. Obama’s legacy.

NASA decided near the end of Friday’s spacewalk that Joe Acaba’s jetpack was no longer reliable and ordered him back inside. He finished his work — lubricating a robotic hand — before heading back in at the six-hour mark with commander Randy Bresnik.  One of Acaba’s jetpack handles kept popping out during the spacewalk. After consulting for several minutes, controllers in Houston finally declared the emergency jetpack no-good, five hours into the spacewalk. Mission Control says Acaba’s safety tethers were solid, and he was in no danger.  Just an hour earlier, Acaba successfully replaced a blurry camera on the robot hand, the main task of the day.

Acaba was greasing the space station’s new robotic hand when he got the news. Just an hour earlier, he successfully replaced a blurry camera on the robot hand, the main task of the day.  NASA says Acaba’s safety tethers for keeping him attached to the orbiting complex are solid, and he’s in no danger.  The jetpack is used only if a spacewalker’s multiple tethers fail. The jetpack is worn on the astronaut’s back, and would enable a runaway astronaut to fly back to the space station.  ___  8 a.m.  Spacewalking astronauts are providing some necessary focus to the International Space Station’s robot arm.

The company's policy calls for removing tweets that a user deletes on their own. But that policy also states that some tweets can survive the process. For instance, retweets of deleted tweets will remain live if the retweeter added a comment. Twitter also can't remove tweets that have been temporarily stored, or ""cached,"" by services such as Google or reposted on other sites.    Twitter might be able to recover some information about any deleted tweets, according to another person familiar with the situation who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the investigation. That person added that the company is working with investigators to find information that's useful.    The account handles previously hadn't been submitted in part due to legal privacy issues, the person said.    Twitter is set to appear Nov. 1 before the Senate intelligence committee at a public hearing. Both Facebook and Google have been invited to testify at the same hearing.    Twitter previously uncovered the accounts linked to Russia's Internet Research Agency -- a notorious ""troll farm"" known for pushing out pro-Russian positions via fake accounts -- by using information provided by Facebook, which found 470 Russia-linked pages or accounts. After looking for patterns linking those accounts and pages to accounts on its service, Twitter said it had suspended 22 accounts that pushed divisive social or political issues during the 2016 campaign. It found another 179 related or linked accounts and took action against those that violated its spam rules.    The company enforces an anti-spam policy against bots and human users that exhibit unusual behavior. Such flags include having multiple accounts repeatedly retweet the same posts or having multiple accounts follow or block other users.    After Twitter's initial closed-door briefing with the Senate committee late last month, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner -- the top Democrat on the committee -- called the company's findings ""frankly inadequate "" and ""derivative"" of Facebook's work.",3.0,10.0

1573,3248,11,9,2017,2017-11-09,Breitbart,Former Facebook President Says Social Media Is ‘Exploiting’ Human Psychology,"Former Napster co-Founder and Facebook President Sean Parker blasted social media in a recent interview for “exploiting” human psychology.  In a recent interview with Axios, former Facebook President Sean Parker discussed the possible negative psychological effects of social media. Parker, the founder and chair of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, spoke at an Axios event at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, where he discussed social media. Parker described himself as “something of a conscientious objector” to social media in general.  Parker discussed the number of people that were against social media when Facebook first started, telling Parker that they’d never join the online world as they valued intimacy and living in the moment. Parker was quite confident that before long they’d be scrolling through a newsfeed like two billion other Facebook users:  When Facebook was getting going, I had these people who would come up to me and they would say, ‘I’m not on social media.’ And I would say, ‘OK. You know, you will be. And then they would say, ‘No, no, no. I value my real-life interactions. I value the moment. I value presence. I value intimacy.’ And I would say, … ‘We’ll get you eventually.’  Parker discussed the possible psychological effects of social media and Facebook in particular, especially for children who are now growing up in a digitally connected age:  I don’t know if I really understood the consequences of what I was saying, because [of] the unintended consequences of a network when it grows to a billion or 2 billion people and … it literally changes your relationship with society, with each other … It probably interferes with productivity in weird ways. God only knows what it’s doing to our children’s brains.  The former Facebook President discussed the company’s initial aim, which was mainly centered around drawing in and building their audience:  The thought process that went into building these applications, Facebook being the first of them, … was all about: ‘How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?’ And that means that we need to sort of give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while, because someone liked or commented on a photo or a post or whatever. And that’s going to get you to contribute more content, and that’s going to get you … more likes and comments.  Parker described Facebook’s appeal as a “social-validation feedback loop” which exploits human psychology to keep users coming back to the app:  It’s a social-validation feedback loop … exactly the kind of thing that a hacker like myself would come up with, because you’re exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology. The inventors, creators — it’s me, it’s Mark [Zuckerberg], it’s Kevin Systrom on Instagram, it’s all of these people — understood this consciously. And we did it anyway.  Parker also briefly discussed how his vast wealth is likely to allow him to live longer than the average person due to advances in medical science:  Because I’m a billionaire, I’m going to have access to better health care so … I’m going to be like 160 and I’m going to be part of this, like, class of immortal overlords. [Laughter] Because, you know the [Warren Buffett] expression about compound interest. … [G]ive us billionaires an extra hundred years and you’ll know what … wealth disparity looks like.

211,1269,9,23,2017,2017-09-23,Associated Press News,Trump trying to turn around GOP holdouts on health bill,"President Donald Trump arrives for a campaign rally for U.S. Senate candidate Luther Strange, Friday, Sept. 22, 2017, in Huntsville, Ala. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Unwilling to concede defeat on a bedrock GOP promise, President Donald Trump on Saturday tried to sway two Republican holdouts on the party’s last-ditch health care hope while clawing at his nemesis who again has brought the “Obamacare” repeal-and-replace effort to the brink of failure.  Trump appealed to Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a possible “no” vote, to swing around for the sake of Alaskans up in arms over high insurance costs, and suggested that Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul might reverse his stated opposition “for the good of the Party!”  Arizona Sen. John McCain, whose announcement Friday that he would not vote for the proposal seemingly scuttled efforts to revive the repeal, came under renewed criticism from the White House. It was the second time in three months that McCain, at 81 in the twilight of a remarkable career and battling brain cancer, had emerged as the destroyer of his party’s signature and yearslong pledge to voters on health care.  “He campaigned on Repeal & Replace. Let Arizona down!” Trump tweeted. He jabbed at the senator with another tweet later in the day: “Democrats are laughingly saying that McCain had a “moment of courage.” Tell that to the people of Arizona who were deceived. 116% increase!”  Trump told those at a rally that Obamacare will be repealed. The president also took a jab at NFL players who protest during the National Anthem at games. (Sept. 22)  The effort to rally support for the bill took another hit Saturday when the nation’s doctors, hospitals and health insurance plans unified in opposition to it. In a joint statement, major groups such as the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, America’s Health Insurance Plans and the BlueCross BlueShield Association called on the Senate to reject the bill and said, “Health care is too important to get wrong.”  With Senate Democrats unanimously opposed, two is the exact number of GOP votes that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., can afford to lose. McCain and Paul are in the “no” column, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, is leaning against the bill and Murkowksi is also a possible “no.”  But Trump isn’t letting go, as seen by his series of tweets while he spends the weekend at his New Jersey golf club.  Aiming at Murkowski, Trump cited increases in premiums and other costs in Alaska under the Affordable Care Act. “Deductibles high, people angry! Lisa M comes through,” he wrote.  Trump, without offering support for his assertion about former presidential rival Paul, said: “I know Rand Paul and I think he may find a way to get there for the good of the Party!”  But there was no doubt where Trump stood on McCain.  “John McCain never had any intention of voting for this Bill,” Trump said. The measure was co-written by South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, McCain’s closest Senate ally, and Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La.  “McCain let his best friend L.G. down!” Trump said, adding that the health bill was “great for Arizona.”  McCain, in explaining that he could not “in good conscience” vote for the legislation, said both parties “could do better working together” but hadn’t “really tried.” He also he could not support the measure “without knowing how much it will cost, how it will affect insurance premiums, and how many people will be helped or hurt by it.”  His opposition all but ensured a major setback for Trump and McConnell, and appeared likely to deepen rifts between congressional Republicans and a president who has begun making deals with Democrats out of frustration with his own party’s failure to turn proposals into laws.  During the election campaign Trump had pledged to quickly kill the Affordable Care Act — “It will be easy,” he contended — and he has publicly chided McConnell for not winning passage before now.  Up until McCain’s announcement, McConnell allies were optimistic McCain’s relationship with Graham might make the difference. GOP leaders hoped to bring the legislation to the full Senate this coming week. They face a Sept. 30 deadline, at which point special rules that prevent a Democratic filibuster will expire.  Democrats hailed McCain’s announcement and pledged to commit to the bipartisan process he sought. GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington have been working on a package of limited legislative fixes to the health law’s marketplaces.  “John McCain shows the same courage in Congress that he showed when he was a naval aviator,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. “I have assured Sen. McCain that as soon as repeal is off the table, we Democrats are intent on resuming the bipartisan process.”  Trump charged that Schumer “sold John McCain a bill of goods. Sad.”  The Graham-Cassidy bill would repeal major pillars of the health law and replace them with block grants to states to design their own programs.  “Large Block Grants to States is a good thing to do. Better control & management,” Trump tweeted.  But major medical groups said millions of people would lose insurance coverage and protections. A bipartisan group of governors announced their opposition.  The House passed its own repeal bill back in May, prompting Trump to convene a Rose Garden celebration, which soon began to look premature.  After the Senate failed in several attempts in July, the legislation looked dead. But Cassidy kept at it with his state-focused approach, and the effort caught new life in recent weeks as the deadline neared. Trump pushed hard, hungry for a win.  The bill would get rid of unpopular mandates for people to carry insurance or face penalties. It would repeal the financing for Obama’s health insurance expansion and create a big pot of money states could tap to set up their own programs, with less federal oversight. It would limit spending for Medicaid, the federal-state program that now covers more than 70 million low-income people. Insurance rules that protect people with pre-existing conditions could be loosened through state waivers.  Over time, the legislation would significantly reduce federal health care dollars now flowing to the states. But McConnell had little margin for error in a Senate split 52-48 between Republicans and Democrats, and could lose only two votes, counting on Pence to break the tie.  ___  Associated Press writers Erica Werner, Alan Fram and Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar in Washington contributed to this report.",9.0,8.0

(AP Photo/Vincent Yu)  HONG KONG (AP) — World stock markets rose Thursday after the European Central Bank was cautious in its move to dial back on its bond-buying stimulus program.  KEEPING SCORE: France’s CAC 40 rose 1 percent to 5,426 and Germany’s DAX gained 0.6 percent to 13,036. Britain’s FTSE 100 added 0.6 percent to 7,488. Wall Street was poised to open higher. Dow futures were up 0.2 percent while those for the S&P 500 gained 0.1 percent.  ECB: The ECB said it would reduce its bond purchases to 30 billion euros ($35 billion) per month starting in January, from 60 billion euros currently. The purchases would continue at least until September 2018. The bank kept some flexibility in its statement, saying that it could increase the purchases if the 19-country eurozone endures a new economic shock. Investors are watching the news conference of ECB President Mario Draghi for more details on the bank’s stimulus outlook.

620,2018,10,14,2017,2017-10-14,Associated Press News,Bannon on GOP insurgency: ‘Nobody can run and hide’," In this Sept. 26, 2017, file photo, U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore greets supporters before his election party in Montgomery, Ala. President Donald Trump’s former chief strategist Steve Bannon is boosting multiple challengers to GOP incumbents and the party’s preferred candidates in next year’s midterm elections(AP Photo/Brynn Anderson, File)  JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Steve Bannon has a stark message to Republican incumbents he considers part of the establishment: “Nobody can run and hide.”  President Donald Trump’s former chief strategist is promoting a field of potential primary challengers to take on disfavored Republicans in Congress and step up for open seats. Among the outsiders: a convicted felon, a perennial candidate linked to an environmental conspiracy theory and a Southern lawmaker known for provocative ethnic and racial comments.  It’s an insurgency that could imperil Republican majorities in the House and Senate. Bannon called it a “populist nationalist conservative revolt” in a speech to religious conservatives in Washington on Saturday.  The emerging Bannon class of rabble-rousers shares limited ideological ties but a common intent to upend Washington and knock out Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., standard-bearer of the establishment.  So intent is Bannon on bringing down McConnell that he laid down this marker Saturday to some of the incumbents at risk of a challenge from his flank of the party: disavow McConnell, satisfy other conditions and possibly escape the wrath.  “Until that time,” he said, the message to the elite is: “They’re coming for you.”  The crop of outsider candidates unnerves a GOP that lost seats — and a shot at the Senate majority — in 2010 and 2012 with political novices and controversial nominees and fears a stinging repeat in 2018.  “The main thing that binds them together is a rejection of the Republican Party establishment, a rejection of the political elites, the financial elites and the media elites,” said Andy Surabian, a former Bannon aide and senior adviser to the pro-Trump PAC Great America Alliance.  Bannon told the religious conservatives that economic nationalism and anti-globalism, the same forces he said elected Trump, can overpower Republican elites.  “This is our war,” he said. “The establishment started it. ... You all are gonna finish it.”  To escape it, he suggested, Senate incumbents can oppose McConnell, eliminate the filibuster that he says is impeding Trump’s agenda and denounce Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, a Republican who gave a scorching appraisal of Trump as an untethered leader who could lead the U.S. into another world war.  Bannon singled out John Barrasso of Wyoming, Deb Fischer of Nebraska and Dean Heller of Nevada as senators who “vote the right way” but did not step up to condemn Corker. There’s still time for a “mea culpa,” he said, implying such senators could be spared his insurgency if they toed his line.  Senate Republicans had been upbeat about adding to their 52-48 majority, especially with Democrats defending more seats next year, 10 in states Trump won in last year’s presidential election.  But the Bannon challenge could cost them, leaving incumbents on the losing end in primaries or GOP candidates roughed up for the general election.  Bannon helped elevate twice-suspended Judge Roy Moore, who won an Alabama runoff over McConnell’s pick, Sen. Luther Strange. Moore was removed from office for refusing to remove a Ten Commandments monument from Alabama’s judicial building, then suspended for insisting probate judges refuse same-sex couples marriage licenses. He faces Democrat Doug Jones in a December election where polls find a single-digit lead for the Republican, a remarkable development in Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ heavily GOP state.  In West Virginia, the grassroots conservative group Tea Party Express endorsed Patrick Morrissey, also a Great America Alliance choice, over establishment favorite Rep. Evan Jenkins in a competitive race to unseat Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin.  Consider Mississippi, where state Sen. Chris McDaniel lost to veteran Sen. Thad Cochran in 2014, but is weighing a bid next year against Roger Wicker, the state’s other senator in the national legislature.  McDaniel misdefined “mamacita,” the Spanish word for mommy, as “hot mama,” and said he would withhold his tax payments if the government paid reparations for slavery — comments he made years earlier as a radio host but critics unearthed during the campaign. He also denounced a supporter who photographed and posted an image of Cochran’s bed-ridden wife in 2014.  He argued in court that his loss to Cochran was due in part to Democrats, many of them African-American, fraudulently voting in the primary. He’s back again and speaking in Bannon terms.  “They will do anything, they will say anything, to just maintain a hold on power,” McDaniel said in an Associated Press interview about McConnell and his allies.  In Arizona, former state Sen. Kelli Ward, who is challenging Trump antagonist Sen. Jeff Flake, remains known for entertaining the debunked theory that jet aircraft are used to affect the weather or poison people intentionally.  Former New York Rep. Michael Grimm, who spent eight months in prison for federal tax evasion, is challenging two-term Rep. Dan Donovan — with the encouragement of Bannon.  In announcing his candidacy, Grimm was apologetic for his conviction. Still out there are viral videos of him telling a television reporter during an on-camera interview at the U.S. Capitol after a question he didn’t like: “You ever do that to me again, I’ll throw you off this (expletive) balcony.”  House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., is sticking with the incumbent: “I support Dan Donovan, plain and simple,” Ryan said this past week.  But he stopped short of suggesting Bannon stand down. “It’s a free country,” he said.  In Nevada, Bannon is encouraging Republican Danny Tarkanian in his challenge to Heller. Tarkanian, son of famed basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian, is 0-5 in state and federal elections.  These outsiders share strong opposition to increasing the nation’s debt even if it means an economy-rattling default. They also share unsparing criticism of congressional Republicans, especially McConnell, for failing to dismantle the Obama-era health care law, an unfulfilled seven-year-old promise.  In Wyoming, Erik Prince, founder of security contractor Blackwater, is considering a Republican primary challenge to Barrasso, a senior member of the Senate GOP leadership team. Bannon has urged Prince, brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, to run.  Bannon has given at least one Senate incumbent — Texas Sen. Ted Cruz — a pass, but not others.  ___  Beaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.",5.0,9.0

The European Central Bank said on Thursday that it had pondered how to wind down its easy money policies, an enormous stimulus program aimed at promoting growth and inflation in the eurozone. But the bank also postponed a decision on when it would actually do so, and will likely decide at least some of the details at its next meeting in October, the bank’s president, Mario Draghi, said.  Even though the eurozone is arguably in its best economic shape in a decade, Mr. Draghi and his colleagues on the bank’s Governing Council have been exceedingly cautious about ending the emergency measures that helped prevent the euro from self-destructing after the global financial meltdown in 2008.  The Federal Reserve in the United States began raising interest rates at the end of 2015, but the European Central Bank continues to flood the 19-nation eurozone with cash as a way to reduce interest rates, stimulate growth and nudge inflation from levels considered to be dangerously low. The measures have worked, for the most part, helping the region overcome a prolonged slump.  But the program — known as quantitative easing — has also had side effects, including fueling a steep rise in real estate prices in Germany that have led to fears of a bubble.",2.0,2.0

Forged in 2015, the Paris agreement is a broad, voluntary framework designed to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels by the end of century. The aim is to help countries hold each other accountable in reducing emissions; it also asks richer countries to help out poorer countries that will suffer the worst impacts of climate change.  Related 4 things to know about the Paris climate agreement  Before Syria, the only other holdout was Nicaragua, a country that didn’t sign because it thought the agreement didn’t go far enough. The Latin American nation joined the agreement in October.  Syria, meanwhile, has been enmeshed in a devastating civil war that’s killed more than 475,000 and displaced 14 million. Its government was also under sanctions, making it difficult for representatives to travel to international climate meetings. While it offered no explanation for its decision to join, it nonetheless sent to a pointed message to the US: You are all alone in your recalcitrance on climate change.  In June, President Donald Trump announced that the US would begin the process to withdraw from the agreement, claiming that it imposes “draconian financial and economic burdens ... on our country” and should be “renegotiated.” (The first claim is utterly false, and the agreement cannot be renegotiated, as Vox’s David Roberts has explained.)  In October, when asked about Nicaragua’s decision to sign, a White House spokesperson affirmed that the Trump administration intends to pull out. “As the president previously stated, the United States is withdrawing unless we can re-enter on terms the are more favorable for our country,” the statement said. (The White House on Tuesday said it had no additional statement on Syria and referred reporters to this one.)  It will take several years to formally withdraw.

F*** me the gaffs[sic] riddled with full blown Jews. Absolutely vile.’  It comes just weeks after the social media giant was accused of aiding and abetting anti-semitic users and failing to act against online hate.  The Daily Mail reports the original post was queried by Shulem Stern, a Hackney local, who reported the tweet within 30 minutes of first seeing it, and was horrified at Twitter’s response.  The anti-Semitic tweet was posted by ‘part time disk jockey’ Thomas Andrews at 8.40pm on October 14 and reported to Twitter at 9.03pm. Andrews later apologised for the tweet and closed his account to public viewing.  Mr. Stern told the Mail Online: “Twitter has got no interest whatsoever in moderating this kind of content. This company repeatedly allows offensive and bullying materials.”  The UK-based Campaign Against Antisemitism group accused the company of letting hate speech “run out of control”. Labour MP John Mann claimed Twitter’s decision not to remove the post showed it had “absolutely no interest” in clamping down on hate speech.  The furore comes just two months after Israeli-born Jewish comedian Shahak Shapira daubed anti-Semitic tweets on the street outside Twitter’s headquarters in Hamburg, Germany to draw attention to the social media giant’s inaction in tackling online hate.  As Breitbart Jerusalem reported, slurs including “Jewish Pig”, “Let’s gas some Jews together” and “Gays to Auschwitz” were chosen to be spray-painted by Shahak Shapira.  Shapira has produced a YouTube video to highlight his protest called ‘#HEYTWITTER’, in which he claims that he has reported almost 300 obnoxious tweets and more than 150 hate comments to Facebook so far this year. Shapira says around 80 percent were removed, but has only have received nine answers for Twitter.

The social network, along with Twitter and Google, was giving evidence to the Senate Intelligence Committee as part of a probe into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election.  Facebook bought Instagram for $1 billion in cash and stock 2012. The photo-sharing service recently announced it has over 800 million monthly active users.  FACEBOOK, GOOGLE, TWITTER: HOW TECH GIANTS ARE INVOLVED IN THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION  Reuters reports that Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch informed the committee that 16 million Americans may have been exposed to Russian information on Instagram, starting in October 2016. Another 4 million people may have been exposed to the information prior to October 2016, he said, but noted that the data was less complete.  Facebook said this week that Russia-linked political ads reached as many as 126 million people on the social network. The Instagram numbers announced Wednesday are in addition to the 126 million figure.  Last month, Facebook announced that it uncovered $100,000 in fake ad spending tied to Russian operatives during the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, associated with around 3,000 ads, which were later turned over to Congress.  FACEBOOK: UP TO 126 MILLION PEOPLE SAW RUSSIAN-BACKED CONTENT  Facebook said Monday that Russia-linked accounts generated 80,000 posts on 120 pages between January 2015 and August 2017. Possible views reached the millions after people liked the posts and shared them. Those are separate from the 3,000 ads turned over to the committees.  During a hearing with the Senate Judiciary Committee Tuesday, none of the companies would commit to fully supporting legislation proposed by Sen. John McCain, R.-Az., Sen.

Jason Mollica, a digital media expert and professor at American University in Washington told Fox News that the companies’ stance is “wrong and dangerous.”  “I think the three are making strides to curb Russian-like ad buys and the like. But, it’s time that social networks stop denying that they are not ‘news’ organizations,” he added. “Digital and social media have changed so much – it’s no longer just a place to share photos.”  'THE SINS OF SILICON VALLEY': BACKLASH MOUNTS AGAINST GOOGLE, FACEBOOK, AMAZON  More than 82,000 people have signed petition calling on Facebook to inform users how they were exposed to “Russian propaganda.”  Russia denies meddling in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election.

597,1993,10,13,2017,2017-10-13,Breitbart,Report: Jared Kushner ‘Enriched Himself’ After Failing to Disclose Business Ownership,"A House Judiciary Committee member is accusing White House Senior Adviser Jared Kushner of enriching himself by not revealing his stake in a real estate business on his financial disclosure forms — a move from which Kushner may have profited.  “It appears [Kushner] ended up being the beneficiary of that omission,” Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) told Newsweek. “He enriched himself by failing to disclose the asset.”  Kushner’s stake in the company, Cadre, was an “administrative error,” according to Kushner’s lawyer but Newsweek reports that it allowed Trump’s son-in-law to maintain a stake in a start-up as it attracted investors and doubled its venture funding.  Kushner submitted his financial disclosure form on March 9 to the Office of Government Ethics, with the company he co-founded with his brother Joshua and a Harvard classmate not specifically listed. Newsweek lays out how different Kushner’s disclosure was from how he eventually amended it:    Kushner’s lawyer says Cadre was not specifically cited on the March 9 form because his holding company, BFPS Ventures, acquired his interest in Cadre on February 17. That transaction appears to be noted on his financial records as a $100,000 to $250,000 sale. But that amount does not match subsequent disclosures. When Kushner finally amended his financial disclosure form on July 21, he valued his interest in Cadre from $5 million to $25 million.  The outlet reports that his failure to include the full value of Cadre in his filing may have allowed him to hold onto most of his interest rather than divest. Additionally, the company may not have been as attractive to investors attracted to the company’s White House ties.  Left-wing billionaire George Soros was one of the initial investors of the project, who reportedly opened up a $250 million line of credit between his offices and Cadre. But it raises the question as to whether a conflict of interest could have arisen. Representatives for Cadre told Newsweek Kushner has a “small, passive investment” in the company, but no operational or advisory role.    “You can have foreign governments or other individuals who have significant interests before Jared Kushner. This is the man responsible for Middle East peace talks and the American Innovation office, Virginia Canter, executive branch ethics counsel for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told Newsweek.  “The point is, Cadre could result in a benefit to him and there’s no way for us to have any insight or to hold him accountable,” she said, before adding that it points to a “systematic problem” considering Kushner’s previously reported problems with his security filings.

1612,3358,11,12,2017,2017-11-12,Fox News,Cause for concern? Pro-ISIS hacking group targets 800 US school websites,"The latest target of pro-ISIS hackers is none other than 800 school websites across the United States.  The widespread hack occurred last Monday, and lasted two hours, in which visitors were redirected to a YouTube propaganda video featuring Arabic audio, the text, “I love Islamic State (ISIS)” and images of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.  “Unless we have irrefutable evidence to suggest otherwise, we need to assume confidential data has been compromised,” Hamid Karimi, vice president of business development and the security expert at Beyond Security. “That should be a cause for concern. To remedy the situation, all schools and institutions that serve minors must submit to (a) stricter set of cybersecurity rules.”  The breached school websites, which spanned nationwide from New Jersey to Arizona and Virginia to Connecticut, are all powered by a company called SchoolDesk. The company since has handed over its server — which runs out of Georgia — to the FBI for investigation and also has hired external security firms to trace the hackers. The Atlanta-based company said after the hack that technicians detected that a small file had been injected into the root of one of its websites.  “The websites were redirected to an iframed YouTube video. No data was lost or altered in any way. Because we’re currently working with the FBI in an active investigation of this incident, as well as forensic team from Microsoft, we cannot yet discuss any technical details or exact methods of access to SchoolDesk’s network or software,” a spokesperson for SchoolDesk told Fox News.  The company has insisted that no personal or student information was exposed, but some security experts say the matter should be closely monitored, especially as minors are involved.  “In most hacks, organizations do not have full visibility into what happened or what information was compromised,” surmised Eric Cole, who served as commissioner on cyber security for President Barack Obama, and was formally a senior vice president at MacAfee and the chief scientist at Lockheed Martin. “In almost every breach, what is initially reported is usually extremely conservative and over the weeks following a breach, it is always worse than what was originally reported.”  The proud culprits of the hack? A shadowy pro-ISIS hacktivist outfit known as “Team System DZ.”  Lorraine Murphy of The Cryptosphere, a specialist hacking and malware news site, which long has been tracking Team System DZ, said that the group generally speaking is focused on “making public deface” rather than penetrating systems and getting information, and has been in-motion pre-dating ISIS, going back to at least 2013.  “They used to support freedom for Palestine, #OpFreeGaza, and freedom for Kashmir, and now they support ISIS,” Murphy said. “Team System DZ basically has one trick: take advantage of outdated WordPress sites, and make bold, scary-looking defaces. It’s a trick that has been working for them for three years, and there is no reason to believe that it will stop working anytime soon.”  Over the course of more than three years, the group has hacked vast and a seemingly arbitrary range of thousands of websites across the world — from scores of U.S. government sites including the Washington State Department of Health, the Ohio Department of Administrative Services and the Howard County, Maryland government site, which were replaced with a black screen, Islamic calligraphy, the Call to Prayer and the words: “You will be held accountable, Trump, you and all your people every drop of blood flowing in Muslim countries.” Canada’s Prince Albert police station also was targeted last week, and the city council in Aberdeen, Scotland, and even a local West Yorkshire, England rugby team have been apprehended in the past.  “The wide range of targets all had one common characteristic: they had weak network and web protection,” Karimi pointed out. “It appears that Team DZ was acting opportunistically as opposed to surgically.”  'JIHADI COOL': HOW ISIS SWITCHED ITS RECRUITMENT AND SOCIAL MEDIA MASTER PLAN  Cyber forensic data has indicated that the attacks waged by the group initially came from Algeria, also indicated by the use of the “DZ,” which is the country’s internet domain code.  However, it is likely that they have franchised their defacing operations without a central command, Harimi explained, thus have become both global and difficult to track. For example, Alex Kassirer, director of counterterrorism at intel firm Flashpoint, told Fox News that the group is known to have at least one member from Jordan based on the actor’s pseudonym “zilzal jordan,” with zilzal being the Arabic word for earthquake.  “The threat they pose is largely limited to the propaganda and messaging war,” she continued.  The FBI long have been reported to be investigating the notorious Team System DZ, but declined to comment on the matter. It is believed that no one directly part of the sympathizer hacking group, despite how long they have been operating, are believed to ever have been made.  “What they typically do is cyber-graffiti, they are attempting to spread propaganda on behalf of ISIS to garner support,” noted Dan McNemar, director of threat intelligence at Binary Defense Systems. “A number of pro-ISIS groups have come and gone, Team DZ has certainly been around the longest.”  LEAVE NO MAN BEHIND: EXPERT TEAM PREPARES TO RETRIEVE REMAINS OF FALLEN WWII SERVICEMEN FROM UP TO 350 FEET BELOW ICE  But alliance ties between Team System DZ and ISIS itself remain murky. To date, ISIS has not formally acknowledged the group or indicated they have any authority over the cyber outfit. Yet as long as such hacking groups remain unscathed, so too does the propaganda and recruitment machine — along with their potential to go beyond the realm of website defacement.  “They have not been arrested primarily because they are a low-level operator that is more nuisance than genuine threat at this point. Why waste time on a web defacer, when we can spend time on high value targets instead? But we should be thinking about how these attacks could ‘evolve’ in the future,” added Jeff Bardin, chief information officer of Treadstone 71, a security firm specializing in cyber-threat intelligence and analyzing online jihadists and extremist groups. “To go beyond mere propaganda into more serious territory like cyber extortion and threats.”",1.0,2.0

Bannon.  During a speech to The Remembrance Project members, the organization that represents American victims of illegal alien crimes, Bannon said it was “obvious” that populist, pro-American immigration reformers are taking over the Republican Party.  “We’re going to have a lot more victories,” Bannon said. “And it’s obvious to everybody that we’re going to have to take over the Republican Party. Now the elites in the Republican Party can either go the easy way or the hard way, but they’re going.”  Bannon said Americans would continue to have to push back against efforts by the Republican establishment and party elites to ram through legislation that would give amnesty to millions of illegal aliens.  “If you think about the last couple of days, this is why I’m saying it’s never going to stop, it’s never going to go away, you’re going to have to do this every day, day in and day out, you’re going to have to fight,” Bannon said to the victims’ families. “November 9th is just another day. We got a victory, we’re going to have defeats, right. But I know you’re going to have a lot more Judge Moores than we’re going to have Bob Corkers.”  “Remember in Alabama, Judge Moore had $2 million, they had $32 million,” Bannon said.  “They put $32 million on Judge Moore to destroy him and his wife and his family. Just like they did Donald Trump. Did Hillary bring up this?” Bannon asked as he pointed to a wall of photos of illegal alien crime victims. “Did they ever bring up this? Did they ever want to talk about this? Did she ever want to give a speech on this? She ever want to address this? She ever come and talk to you folks? None. You know why? They can’t win on that, right? They just want politics of personal destruction. That’s all they dumped on Donald Trump.”  “But here’s the thing that we’ve proven now with authentic candidates and a great set of ideas and a message and you know, grassroots folks who are enthusiastic and go door-to-door: the more money they spend, the fewer votes they get,” Bannon said of the Republican establishment. “That’s an iron-clad calculus. You all have been able to flip in Alabama and we’re doing it, you see it all the time now on this insurgency in the United States Senate, that we’ve turned their biggest asset, their money, into their biggest liability.”  “We’ve made Mitch McConnell so toxic,” Bannon said. “You got Orrin Hatch, you got Heller, you got all these folks, they’re not looking for Mitch’s endorsement. They’re running from it.”  While House Speaker Paul Ryan has reportedly failed to get an amnesty deal for illegal aliens slipped into an end-of-the-year spending bill, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says that he wants all immigration deals to include an amnesty for illegal aliens.  While the Republican establishment considers amnesty, Trump’s detailed list of immigration priorities has been seemingly ignored, despite their popularity with the American people, as Breitbart News reported.",7.0,3.0
1348,2947,11,3,2017,2017-11-03,Vox,The Trump administration is going after the lawyers of an immigrant teen who had an abortion,"For more than a month this fall, a teenager known as Jane Doe fought the federal government for the right to get an abortion while living in an immigration shelter. She succeeded in getting the procedure last week — but the government is still fighting.  The Department of Justice now argues that the American Civil Liberties Union, which represented Doe in court, misled the government about the timing of Doe’s abortion. The department is petitioning the Supreme Court to vacate a lower court’s ruling in the case, which could have consequences for other pregnant minors in Doe’s position. It is also asking the Supreme Court to consider disciplinary action against Doe’s legal team.  Doe, who is 17 and arrived to the US undocumented and without her parents, lives in a Texas shelter under the jurisdiction of the Office of Refugee Resettlement. A new ORR policy, instituted under the Trump administration, bars unaccompanied, undocumented minors from getting abortions without permission from the director of ORR. Doe and her lawyers were battling this policy, and on October 24, a court ruled that the government could not block her from getting an abortion. (You can read more about the case here.) On the morning of October 25, Doe was able to get an abortion.  The government now says the ACLU had agreed to inform them when Doe’s abortion was scheduled, and did not do so. The government knew that Doe had an appointment scheduled for October 25, but believed it was for preabortion counseling, not abortion. Under Texas law, anyone seeking an abortion must get counseling at least 24 hours prior to the procedure, from the doctor who will perform the abortion. Doe had received counseling from a doctor the week of October 16, and since that doctor was able to perform her abortion, she did not need counseling again.  According to its petition, the Justice Department had planned to file an application for a stay on the morning of October 25 that would have delayed the abortion further, but Doe got the procedure before the department was able to do so.  The petition asks the Supreme Court to vacate the October 24 decision that allowed Doe to get an abortion. Obviously, this would not affect Doe directly; she has already gotten the procedure. But the ACLU has filed a motion for class certification, which could help other unaccompanied minors get abortions without government interference. If the court decision in Doe’s favor is vacated, lawyers would no longer be able to cite that precedent in arguing on behalf of all unaccompanied minors.  The Justice Department’s petition also suggests that the Supreme Court explore taking disciplinary action against Doe’s lawyers, either directly or through state bar associations, “for what appear to be material misrepresentations and omissions to government counsel designed to thwart this Court’s review.”  “Friday’s appeal is a flagrant effort to crucify the individual attorneys who represented Doe, and to terrify likeminded lawyers into acquiescence,” Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern write at Slate. “The DOJ is using the full weight of a government agency to threaten professional ruin upon the lawyers who defended Jane Doe’s constitutional right to abortion access.”  The ACLU argues that Doe’s lawyers were under no legal obligation to tell the government when her abortion was scheduled. “The medical details of her appointment are something for her and her doctor,” said David Cole, the legal director of the ACLU. To the extent that the ACLU notified the government of Doe’s schedule at all, he said, it was for logistical reasons, to set up Doe’s release from the shelter and transfer to the clinic.  The government could have appealed the October 24 decision immediately, Cole said, and did not do so. “Now after being criticized for that by the anti-choice movement, they’re seeking to deflect the blame onto us,” he said.  In an October 27 interview on Fox News, anchor Bret Baier asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions to respond to “pro-life critics out there saying your department dropped the ball on this” by not appealing sooner. Sessions said that the timing of the abortion “was a total surprise” and represented “a breach of the kind of confidence that lawyers should be able to have with one another.”  ""I don't believe that we should be using taxpayers’ dollars to fund abortions and I think in this case, it certainly was not justified,"" he added. ""I'm very disappointed that these lawyers were able to take the client around the law to avoid a court hearing.""  Jane Doe did not seek federal funding for her abortion, and private funds, not federal dollars, paid for the procedure, according to the ACLU.  The ACLU has 60 days to respond to the Justice Department’s petition, and then the Supreme Court will decide whether to hear the case. “We will be urging the court to deny the petition,” Cole said.",7.0,6.0
1543,3211,11,9,2017,2017-11-09,Fox News,Mexican citizen executed in Texas for decades-old killing vows he ‘will be back for justice’,"The Mexican citizen executed Wednesday night for killing his 16-year-old cousin wrote in a handwritten statement that he will be back for justice, ""You can count on that!""  Ruben Ramirez Cardenas, 47, was given a lethal injection after several federal court appeals failed to halt his punishment for the February 1997 killing of Mayra Laguna, 16. She was abducted from her family's apartment and beaten to death.  Asked by the warden to make a final statement, he replied, ""No, sir.""  As the lethal dose of pentobarbital began, he took a couple of breaths and then began snoring. After less than a minute, all movement stopped.  Twenty-one minutes later, at 10:26 p.m. CST, he was pronounced dead, making him the seventh convicted killer put to death this year in Texas, which carries out capital punishment more than any other state.  In a handwritten statement released afterward, Cardenas thanked his family, attorneys and the Mexican consulate for their help.  His punishment was delayed for about four hours as last-ditch appeals for the former security guard focused primarily on efforts to have trial evidence undergo new DNA testing. In a filing to the U.S. Supreme Court hours before his execution, lawyers argued Texas was violating Cardenas' due process rights and a state statute that covers forensic testing. They asked the justices to halt the execution for a court review.  They also asked the justices for more time to appeal a lower court's rejection of a federal civil rights lawsuit in which they claimed his due process and civil rights were being violated because Texas officials wouldn't release evidence so it can undergo new DNA testing.  Attorneys for the state said the lawsuit was improper and that state courts already refused the DNA request because Cardenas could not show that more advanced tests would exonerate him. DNA results in evidence at Cardenas' trial were not false, state attorneys said.  The high court, without comment, rejected both appeals.  Earlier this week, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the state's highest criminal court, rejected a similar appeal seeking DNA tests. Cardenas' attorneys argued the new testing would be better than the now-obsolete testing that left ""persistent doubts about his guilt and the integrity of his conviction.""  Laguna was snatched from a bedroom she shared with a younger sister at her family's public housing apartment in McAllen in South Texas. In a confession to police, Cardenas said he and a friend drove around with the high school student in his mother's car. He said he had sex with the teen and then punched her as she fought him after he unbound her arms to let her go.  ""I didn't plan on doing this, but I was high on cocaine,"" he told authorities.  He said after he hit the teen in the neck, she began coughing up blood and having difficulty breathing. After trying unsuccessfully to revive her, he said he tied her up ""and rolled her down a canal bank.""  Her body was found in a canal near a lake in the Rio Grande Valley in far South Texas. It’s what happened next that has Mexican officials and human rights groups arguing he shouldn’t be put to death.  Cardenas' defense team, funded by the Mexican government, claims the United States violated an international treaty by denying Cardenas the opportunity to speak to his country’s consulate after his arrest.  “It’s a significant treaty violation,” Gregory Kuykendall, an Arizona attorney authorized to speak on behalf of Mexico, told the Houston Chronicle.  If Texas officials execute Cardenas, they would be in apparent violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.  In 2004, the U.N.’s international court in the Hague ruled that the U.S. must review cases similar to Cardenas’. Then-President George W. Bush told states to comply but the Supreme Court overruled him and said it was up to Congress – not the president – to order states to obey.  Since then, Congress has dragged its feet.  “The result: an illegal loophole states are exploiting to execute foreign nationals in violation of international law,” the ACLU says.  Laguna's sister, Roxana Jones, said she had waited 21 years for justice to be served.  ""Words can't begin describe the relief it feels to know that there is true peace after so much pain and sorrow,"" she said in a statement.  Cardenas' attorney, Maurie Levin, contended eyewitness testimony against Cardenas was shaky, that little physical evidence tied him to the killing and that his confession was obtained after 22 hours of isolation and intense police questioning.  She also said that authorities acted improperly when not telling the Mexican-born Cardenas that he could get legal help from the Mexican consulate.  Cardenas grew up in the Texas Rio Grande Valley.  The friend who was with Cardenas during the abduction, Jose Antonio Lopez Castillo, now 45, was convicted of aggravated kidnapping and is serving a 25-year prison term.

Yet the United States cannot formally leave the accord until 2020, and in the interim administration officials have said they will continue to protect American interests, which essentially translates into helping to write the Paris agreement’s rule book. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, have both dangled the possibility that some as-yet undefined improved terms might one day persuade the president to reconsider.  This ambiguous position will be on stage at the meeting of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, at which representatives of the nearly 200 signers to the Paris agreement will gather beginning on Nov. 6 in Bonn.  “The U.S. is still at the table,” said James L. Connaughton, who served as an environmental adviser to George W. Bush. “It’s very important for the United States to have a presence. The U.S. is looked to and heavily engaged regardless of differences of opinion.”  The two-week session promises to be a volatile mix of anger toward the United States for declaring its intention to withdraw from the accord, mixed with lingering hope it might stay. Developing countries, particularly some of the most vulnerable to climate change, will most likely use the spotlight of the forum to denounce the Trump administration’s growing ranks of climate deniers and recent moves to repeal regulations limiting greenhouse gases.",1.0,7.0

He also traveled to Las Vegas last month after the massacre at a country music festival – the deadliest mass shooting in United States history.

Marc E. Elias, a lawyer representing the Clinton campaign and the DNC, retained Fusion GPS, a Washington firm, to conduct the research.  After that, Fusion GPS hired dossier author Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer with ties to the FBI and the U.S. intelligence community, according to those people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.  “UNKNOWN REPUBLICAN CLIENT”  Elias and his law firm, Perkins Coie, retained the company in April 2016 on behalf of the Clinton campaign and the DNC. Before that agreement, Fusion GPS’s research into Trump was funded by an unknown Republican client during the GOP primary.  The Clinton campaign and the DNC, through the law firm, continued to fund Fusion GPS’s research through the end of October 2016, days before Election Day.  Fusion GPS gave Steele’s reports and other research documents to Elias, the people familiar with the matter said. It is unclear how or how much of that information was shared with the campaign and the DNC and who in those organizations was aware of the roles of Fusion GPS and Steele. One person close to the matter said the campaign and the DNC were not informed by the law firm of Fusion GPS’s role.  The dossier has become a lightning rod amid the intensifying investigations into the Trump campaign’s possible connections to Russia. Some congressional Republican leaders have spent months trying to discredit Fusion GPS and Steele and tried to determine the identity of the Democrat or organization that paid for the dossier.  THANKS TO TRUMP’S PRESSURE, THE TRUTH CAME OUT:  Trump tweeted as recently as Saturday that the Justice Department and FBI should “immediately release who paid for it.”  Elias and Fusion GPS declined to comment on the arrangement. Spokesmen for the Clinton campaign and the DNC had no immediate comment.  Some of the details are included in a Tuesday letter sent by Perkins Coie to a lawyer representing Fusion GPS, telling the research firm that it was released from a ­client-confidentiality obligation. The letter was prompted by a legal fight over a subpoena for Fusion GPS’s bank records.  People involved in the matter said that they would not disclose the dollar amounts paid to Fusion GPS but that the campaign and the DNC shared the cost.  Read more: WaPo",37.0,40.0
529,1920,10,12,2017,2017-10-12,Breitbart,"Cheap Labor, Open Borders Swamp Embraces Trump’s DHS Pick: ‘Experience Being Valued over Outsiders’","The Washington, D.C. political establishment – which supports a constant inflow of cheap, foreign workers to take American blue-collar jobs – and open border policies, is heaping praise on President Trump’s pick to lead the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Kirstjen Nielsen.  Nielsen, a donor to Republican establishment darling Jeb Bush and former DHS official under President George W. Bush, is being praised by pro-open borders Bush allies with whom she’s previously worked.  In the Washington Post, former Bush official and lobbyist Stewart Verdery welcomed Trump’s choice to pick Nielsen to run DHS because she was not an outsider.  “Nielsen’s nomination is a strong signal of competence and experience being valued by the White House over ideologues and outsiders,” Verdery told the Washington Post. “The homeland mission requires an unusual, diverse set of skills, and she has expertise in almost all of them.”  In 2014, Verdery urged House and Senate Republicans to give in to amnesty for the 12 to 30 million illegal aliens living in the U.S., writing for CNN how the GOP needed to support the expansion of foreign work visa programs, where cheaper foreigners are brought to the U.S. to take American jobs.  As a lobbyist, Verdery’s Monument Policy Group represents tech firms like Microsoft and Amazon, both of which have lobbied the Trump administration for more foreign workers to be imported to the U.S., further driving down the wages of American workers, immigration reformers argue.  Microsoft, which Verdery’s lobbying firm represents, even admitted to hiring illegal aliens who have been shielded from deportation by the Obama-created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, as Breitbart Texas reported.  Also praising Nielsen’s appointment to DHS is pro-amnesty Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, who has a long record of opposing the pro-American immigration agenda that got Trump elected.  In the Washington Post, Ridge said of Nielsen:  Former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge (R), the first secretary of homeland security, said in a statement that Nielsen was a “homeland security veteran” who was “extremely well versed in the all-hazard threats” challenging the nation’s security and resilience. “Kirstjen can hit the ground running and there won’t be a learning curve,” Ridge said. “Most importantly, in this hyper-political environment, Kirstjen is not a self-promoter. She is a patriot and takes a mission-focused approach to her work.”  When Ridge was serving as the head of DHS under Bush in 2003, he demanded that the entire illegal alien population be “legalized” and allowed to remain in the U.S.  At the time, Trump ally and Rep. Tom Tancredo (R-CO) slammed Ridge for indirectly pushing amnesty, all while potentially creating a surge at the U.S.-Mexico border.  “Mr. Ridge ought to read the laws he is charged with trying to enforce,” Tancredo told the Washington Times. “We have laws on the books that call for him to find and deport these people, and if he is unwilling to do so, he should resign.”  In 2010, Ridge railed against Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer’s pro-American immigration enforcement — which Trump ally and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach helped craft — saying that instead of deporting illegal aliens, the federal government should have stepped in and legalized the millions of illegal aliens in the U.S.  “It’s ridiculous to think … we’re going to identify 12 million to 14 million people and send them back,” Ridge told the Associated Press at the time.  In 2016, Ridge even went on a media tour to announce that he refused to support Trump’s “America First” candidacy, writing in US News:  My disregard for Donald Trump has been well documented by multiple media outlets over the last several months, so I won’t belabor it yet again. Suffice to say that I am disappointed that he is our party’s nominee. With a bumper sticker approach to policy, his bombastic tone reflects the traits of a bully, not an American president and statesman. If he cannot unite Republicans, how can he unite America? I simply cannot endorse him.  Nielsen’s DHS appointment was additionally cheered by former Bush official Frances Townsend, with the D.C. establishment figure telling the New York Times that Nielsen is “competent.”  “She is tough as nails, competent and has rightly earned the president’s respect,” Townsend said.  In 2013, Townsend welcomed the failed effort to give amnesty to millions of illegal aliens — known as the “Gang of Eight” amnesty bill — saying the open borders plan was in-line with the Bush administration’s goals on immigration.  “This is a redux of the Bush effort and the underlying principles,” Townsend told the Daily Beast at the time.  Nielsen has no record of working specifically on immigration-related issues, despite Trump making pro-American immigration reforms the main theme of his administration. The yet-to-be-confirmed DHS head also does not hold any clear record when it comes to supporting initiatives that reduce legal immigration and limit foreign guest worker programs in order to give wage and competitive relief to America’s working-class and middle-class workforce.",1.0,10.0
1336,2935,11,3,2017,2017-11-03,Associated Press News,Female lawmakers allege harassment by colleagues in House," For years, Republican Rep. Mary Bono endured increasingly suggestive comments from a fellow lawmaker in the House of Representatives. But when the congressman approached her on the House floor and told her he’d been thinking about her in the shower, she’d had enough.  She confronted the man, who she said still serves in Congress, telling him his comments were demeaning and wrong. And he backed off.  Bono, who served 15 years before being defeated in 2012, is not alone.  As reports pile up of harassment or worse by men in entertainment, business and the media, one current and three former female lawmakers tell The Associated Press that they, too, have been harassed or subjected to hostile sexual comments — by fellow members of Congress.  Their stories, published Friday by The AP, renewed calls to tighten up Congress’ own lax training and reporting requirements. House Speaker Paul Ryan sent a memo to fellow lawmakers encouraging them to complete sexual harassment training and mandate it for their staffs, telling them, “Harassment has no place in this institution. ... We can and should lead by example.”  The example set by male members of Congress has not always been admirable, as the accounts from the four female lawmakers who spoke with The AP make clear.  The incidents they recounted occurred years or even decades ago, usually when the women were young newcomers to Congress. They range from isolated comments at one hearing, to repeated unwanted come-ons, to lewd remarks and even groping on the House floor. Coming amid an intensifying national focus on sexual harassment and gender hostility in the workplace, the revelations underscore that no woman is immune, even at the highest reaches of government.  “This is about power,” said Democratic former California Sen. Barbara Boxer, after describing an incident at a hearing in the 1980s where a male colleague made a sexually suggestive comment about her from the dais, which was met with general laughter and an approving second from the committee chairman.  “That was an example of the way I think we were thought of, a lot of us. ... It’s hostile and embarrasses, and therefore could take away a person’s power,” she said.  Bono, Boxer and the other female lawmakers spoke on the record to tell their stories in the wake of revelations about Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein’s serial attacks on women, as well as disclosures from current and former Capitol Hill staffers about harassment by lawmakers and aides.  Largely untold before now is that some female lawmakers themselves say they have been harassed by male colleagues. While rare, the accounts raise troubling questions about the boys’ club environment in Congress where male lawmakers can feel empowered to target not only staffers but even their own peers.  The lawmakers declined to identify the perpetrators by name, but they said at least two of the men continue to serve in the House. None of the female lawmakers interviewed reported what happened, and some noted it was not clear where they would lodge such a complaint. At least three of the four told friends or aides about the incidents, which in some cases were witnessed by other lawmakers.  “When I was a very new member of Congress in my early 30s, there was a more senior member who outright propositioned me, who was married, and despite trying to laugh it off and brush it aside it, would repeat. And I would avoid that member,” said Rep. Linda Sanchez, D-Calif. She added that she would warn other new female members about the lawmaker in question, but she declined to identify him, while saying he remains in Congress.  “I just don’t think it would be helpful” to call the lawmaker out by name, Sanchez said. “The problem is, as a member there’s no HR department you can go to, there’s nobody you can turn to. Ultimately they’re employed by their constituents.”  Sanchez also said that a different male colleague repeatedly ogled her, and at one point touched her inappropriately on the House floor, while trying to make it appear accidental. She declined to identify the lawmaker but said he was no longer in Congress.  Bono, who arrived in the House at age 36 to replace her husband Sonny Bono after he died in a skiing accident, said she ultimately confronted her colleague on the House floor after he’d made repeated harassing comments.  She said it seemed like the lawmaker didn’t know how to talk to a woman as an equal. “Instead of being, ‘How’s the weather, how’s your career, how’s your bill,’ it was, ‘I thought about you while I was in the shower.’ So it was a matter of saying to him, ‘That’s not cool, that’s just not cool.’”  Bono declined to identify the lawmaker, saying the behavior stopped after she finally challenged him. He still serves in Congress, she said.  “It is a man’s world, it’s still a man’s world,” Bono said. “Not being a flirt and not being a bitch. That was my rule, to try to walk that fine line.”  Former Rep. Hilda Solis, now a Los Angeles County supervisor, recalls repeated unwanted harassing overtures from one lawmaker, though she declined to name him or go into detail.  “I don’t think I’m the only one. What I tried to do was ignore it, turn away, walk away. Obviously it’s offensive. Are you supposed to be flattered? No, we’re adults. Not appropriate,” said Solis, who left Congress in 2009 to join the Obama administration as labor secretary.  “It’s humiliating, even though they may have thought they were being cute. No, it’s not. It’s not appropriate. I’m your colleague, but he doesn’t see me that way, and that’s a problem,” Solis said.  The experiences occurred against the backdrop of broader gender inequities in Congress, where women remain a distinct minority, making up only about 20 percent of members in the House and Senate. That’s up from fewer than 10 percent in the quarter-century since politics’ Year of the Woman in 1992. That election season, large numbers of women sought office following hearings by the then-all-male Senate Judiciary Committee over Anita Hill’s testimony about alleged sexual harassment by Clarence Thomas, who was subsequently confirmed to the Supreme Court.  The increase in numbers and the prominence of a few individual women, such as House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, has not resulted in parity in all measures, nor eliminated the potential for male members to demean or even harass their female counterparts. Nonetheless, a few female lawmakers contacted by the AP expressed surprise and even disbelief at the notion that lawmakers themselves could be victims of harassment.  Democratic Rep. Jackie Speier of California has recently gone public with an account of being sexually assaulted by a male chief of staff while she was a congressional staffer. She has criticized the vague rules in place on the issue and has introduced legislation aimed at increasing protections for congressional employees. In a video posted to Twitter last week, she called Congress “a breeding ground for a hostile work environment” and encouraged others to come forward.  Yet when it comes to lawmakers themselves, Speier said: “I think the women in Congress are big girls. The equalizer that exists in Congress that doesn’t exist in other settings is that we all get paid the same amount and we all have a vote, the same vote. So if you have members that are demeaning you it’s because you’re letting them.”  Democratic former Rep. Ellen Tauscher of California argued that although male lawmakers “can be jackasses ... I don’t believe members of Congress can sexually harass each other, which is a legal term of art, because we are equals in our work.”  In fact, the law specifies that harassment can occur between equals, said Jennifer Drobac, a professor at the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law, who teaches a course in sexual harassment law.  “Formally, two members of Congress may have the same status. That doesn’t change the fact that sexual harassment can occur between peers,” Drobac said, noting that numerous other factors can come into play, including the difference in age and length of service between the members, and the mere fact that men have more power in society than women.  Yet the fact that some dispute whether harassment could even occur between members of Congress underscores the complexity of the issue and the fraught questions surrounding it.  Bono said she found power in confronting her harasser, and that after she did so it never happened again. She emphasized that she encountered only a couple out-of-line colleagues during her time in the House, and said that she understood her experience was different than those of young staffers who may face harassment from someone who could retaliate against them.  But Bono strongly disputed any suggestion that she or any other female lawmaker could not be harassed by their peers.  “My career didn’t suffer, I didn’t suffer,” Bono said. “But it did happen.”  ___  Follow Erica Werner on Twitter @ericawerner and Juliet Linderman @julietlinderman",22.0,15.0
660,2060,10,16,2017,2017-10-16,Associated Press News,Trump voters in storm-ravaged county confront climate change," The church was empty, except for the piano too heavy for one man to move. It had been 21 days since the greatest storm Wayne Christopher had ever seen dumped a year’s worth of rain on his town, drowning this church where he was baptized, met his high school sweetheart and later married her.  He had piled the ruined pews out on the curb, next to water-logged hymnals and molding Sunday school lesson plans and chunks of drywall that used to be a mural of Noah’s Ark. Now he tilted his head up to take in the mountain of rubble, and Christopher, an evangelical Christian and a conservative Republican, considered what caused this destruction: that the violent act of nature had been made worse by acts of man.  “I think the Lord put us over the care of his creation, and when we pollute like we do, destroy the land, there’s consequences to that,” he said. “It might not catch up with us just right now, but it’s gonna catch up. Like a wound that needs to be healed.”  Jefferson County, Texas, is among the low-lying coastal areas of America that could lose the most as the ice caps melt and the seas warm and rise. At the same time, it is more economically dependent on the petroleum industry and its emissions-spewing refineries than any other place in the U.S. Residents seemed to choose between the two last November, abandoning a four-decade-old pattern of voting Democratic in presidential elections to support Donald Trump.  When the people of Jefferson County, Texas, narrowly voted majority Trump last November, climate change rarely came up as an issue. Then they were devastated by Hurricane Harvey. AP Video by Martha Irvine. (Oct. 16)  Then came Hurricane Harvey. Now some conservatives here are newly confronting some of the most polarizing questions in American political discourse: What role do humans play in global warming and the worsening of storms like Harvey? And what should they expect their leaders — including the climate-skeptic president they helped elect — to do about the problem now?  Answers are hard to come by in a place where refineries stand like cityscapes. Nearly 5,000 people work in the petroleum industry. Some have described the chemical stink in the air as “the smell of money” — it means paychecks, paid mortgages and meals.  Christopher, like most people in Jefferson County, believed that global warming was real before the storm hit. Post-Harvey, surrounded by debris stretching for block after block, he thinks the president’s outright rejection of the scientific consensus is no longer good enough.  But how do you help the climate without hurting those who depend on climate-polluting industries?  “It’s a Catch-22 kind of thing,” he said. “Do you want to build your economy, or do you want to save the world?”  ___  “Steroids for storms” is how Andrew Dessler explains the role global warming plays in extreme weather. Climate change didn’t create Hurricane Harvey or Irma or Maria. But Dessler, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University, and most scientists agree that warming and rising seas likely amplify storms that form naturally, feeding more water and more intensity as they plow toward land.  “It will be 60 inches of rain this time, maybe 80 inches next time,” Dessler said of Harvey’s record-setting rainfall for any single storm in U.S. history.  As a private citizen and candidate, Trump often referred to climate change as a hoax, and since taking office he and his administration have worked aggressively to undo policies designed to mitigate the damage. He announced his intention to pull out of the Paris climate agreement, a global accord of 195 nations to reduce carbon emissions, and his administration has dismantled environmental regulations and erased climate change data from government websites. This month, his Environmental Protection Agency administrator promised to kill an effort to limit carbon emissions from coal-fired plants.  Anthony Leiserowitz, a Yale University researcher, traces the politicization of the climate to 1997, when then-Democratic Vice President Al Gore brokered a commitment on the world stage to reduce greenhouse gases. The political parties have cleaved further apart ever since, and climate change denial reached a fever pitch as the Tea Party remade the GOP during President Barack Obama’s first term.  Americans tend to view the issue through their already established red-versus-blue lens, Leiserowitz said, but while there are fractions on each extreme, the majority still fall somewhere along a scale in the middle.  A new Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll finds that 63 percent of Americans think climate change is happening and that the government should address it, and that two-thirds of Americans disapprove of the way Trump is handling the issue. Most Americans also think weather disasters are getting more severe, and believe global warming is a factor.  As the downpour from Hurricane Harvey stretched into its second day, with no end in sight, Joe Evans watched from the window of his home in the Jefferson County seat of Beaumont, and an unexpected sense of guilt overcame him: “What have we been doing to the planet for all of these years?”  Evans, a Republican, once ran unsuccessfully for local office. He ignored climate change, as he thought Republicans were supposed to do, but Harvey’s deluge left him wondering why. When he was young, discussions of the ozone layer were uncontroversial; now they’re likely to end in pitched political debate.  “I think it’s one of those games that politicians play with us,” he said, “to once again make us choose a side.”  Evans voted for Trump, but he’s frustrated with what he describes as the “conservative echo chamber” that dismisses climate change instead of trying to find a way to apply conservative principles to simultaneously saving the Earth and the economy. Even today, some Republicans in the county complain about Gore and the hypocrisy they see in elite liberals who jet around the world, carbon emissions trailing behind them, to push climate policies on blue-collar workers trying to keep refinery jobs so they can feed their families.  Evans isn’t sure if the disastrous run of weather will cause climate change to become a bigger priority for residents here, or if as memories fade talk of this issue will, too.  “I haven’t put so much thought into it that I want to go mobilize a bunch of people and march on Washington,” he said. “But it made me think enough about it that I won’t actively take part in denying it. We can’t do that anymore.”  ___  Most in Texas didn’t believe climate change existed when Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University, began evangelizing about the issue years ago. Now studies estimate that 69 percent of Texans believe that the climate is changing, and 52 percent believe that has been caused by human activity. Most resistance she hears now is not with the science itself but over proposed solutions that mean government intrusion and regulation.  Jefferson County’s refineries produce 10 percent of the gasoline in the United States, 20 percent of diesel and half of the fuel used to fly commercial planes, said County Judge Jeff Branick, a Democrat who voted for Trump and then switched his party affiliation to Republican, in part because of his disagreement with the Democratic Party’s climate policies.  Branick doesn’t deny that climate change exists, but he calls himself a cheerleader for the petroleum industry and believes environmental policies are “job killers.”  John Sterman, a professor at MIT Sloan School of Management, said addressing climate change will invariably lead to gradual job losses in the fossil fuels industry. But communities have lost a dominant industry before, and those able to diversify can prosper. Jefferson County could look to the renewable energy industry, with jobs that require many of the skills refinery workers have, he said. Texas already produces more wind power than any other state.  Angela Lopez’s husband works in a refinery, so she understands the worry of the economic cost of addressing global warming. But her county is nicknamed “cancer alley” for its high levels of disease that residents have long attributed to living in the shadow of one of the largest concentrations of refineries in the world.  “It’s our livelihood, but it’s killing us,” Lopez said, standing in what used to be her dining room. Now her house in Beaumont is down to the studs. As Harvey’s floodwaters rose, she tried to save what she could. She piled the dresser drawers on the bed and perched the leather couch up on the coffee table. It did no good. The water didn’t stop until it reached the eaves, and the Lopezes lost everything they own.  Just about all of her relatives are conservatives, and indeed the political divides in the county run deep: Even as most of the communities along the Gulf Coast turned red years ago, Jefferson County clung to its Democratic roots. The county is ethnically diverse —41 percent white, 34 percent black and 20 percent Hispanic — with a historically strong union workforce. Trump won Jefferson by just 419 votes.  “To come up with real solutions, you have to be honest with yourself about what causes something to happen,” Lopez said. “It’s not just because some storm came, it was bad and unprecedented. It was unprecedented for a reason, so we have to acknowledge that and start working toward being better. And part of that conversation should be climate change.”  On a porch outside another ruined house nearby, two neighbors who both lost everything to Harvey started having that conversation.  Gene Jones, a truck driver who didn’t vote, asked Wilton Johnson, a Trump supporter, if he thought climate change intensified the storm.  “I don’t think so, no,” Johnson said.  “You don’t? You don’t think about the chemical plants and the hot weather? You don’t think that has anything to do with it?”  “I can understand people believing that,” Johnson replied. But he blames natural weather cycles for upending their lives so completely.  Jones now lives in a camper in his driveway; Johnson’s father has been sleeping in a recliner in his yard to ward off looters.  Johnson feels like he’s gone through the stages of grief. At first, as he fled his home, he denied how devastating the storm might be. Then he got angry, when he realized nothing could be saved — not the family photos or the 100-year-old Bible that fell apart in his hands. He grew depressed and now, finally, he thinks he’s come to accept this new reality as something that just happened because nature is not always kind, and never has been.  And he remains unshaken in his support for Trump’s environmental agenda.  “We need to be responsible human beings to the Earth, but at the same time we shouldn’t sacrifice the financial freedoms,” he said. “What good is a great environment if we’re poor and living like cavemen? And vice versa, I understand the other side of that: What’s great about living in luxury when you can’t go outside?  “I just don’t think we should look at two storms and say, ‘We’re ruining the Earth! Shut the plants down!’”  ___  When Wayne Christopher was a boy in Jefferson County, it got so hot he remembers frying eggs on the sidewalk. It has always been hot here, and there have always been hurricanes.  But it seems to him that something is different now. There is a palpable intensity in the air, in the haze that hangs over the interstate. The region has warmed about two degrees in his lifetime, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and annual rainfall has increased by about 7 inches on average. Christopher counts the number of times a beach road he’s driven on all his life has had to be rebuilt because the ocean overtook it.  “The sea keeps moving in — water rising, land disappearing or eroding or whatever you want to call it — it’s happening,” said Christopher, who is 66 now and retired after toiling more than 40 years for the railroad. “I think Mother Nature can come back, but there’s a point to where, if we just keep on and keep on, I don’t know if she can come back.”  He thinks the president he helped put in office should do something: take the threat seriously, research before he talks or tweets, not dismiss established science as a hoax because acknowledging it’s real would mean acknowledging that something must be done.  But like many others here, Christopher is not pushing to stick with the Paris climate agreement or other global coalitions because he’s not sure it’s fair that the United States should invest in clean energy when other countries that pollute might not. He worries that could cause more job losses to overseas factories, put a squeeze on the middle class and forfeit a slice of American sovereignty.  His wife, who also supported Trump, cocked her head as she thought about that sentiment.  “I can see the pros, I can see the cons,” Polly Christopher said. “But if you were to simplify it to your children, and they say, ‘Well, everybody else is doing it, if I do it what difference is it going to make?’ you would just get on them and say, ‘You’ve got to do the right thing. Right is right, and wrong’s wrong.’”  For weeks, the couple have been gutting Memorial Baptist Church, a place they consider their home. The congregation dwindled over time to about 45, mostly older people, and it was so hard to make ends meet the church canceled a $19,000-a-year flood insurance policy just two months before Harvey hit. Now it could cost some $1 million to rebuild, meaning the church may never be rebuilt at all.  So when Christopher’s granddaughter came by to help, found the piano in the otherwise empty sanctuary, sat down and started to play, he was overcome with a sense of grief.  “In my head I was thinking the whole time, this could be the last time that piano is played inside the auditorium,” he said. Then she started to sing: “Amazing grace, how sweet the sound ...”  “It did something to me,” he said.  Both he and his wife believe President Trump has a responsibility to look at the destruction Harvey left them with and act accordingly.  “He’s got a business mind. Whatever it takes to make money, that’s what he’s going to do to make America great again,” Christopher said, and that’s why he voted for Trump. “But it does make me wonder if he looks at global warming as a real harm. Because you can make all the money in the world here. But if you don’t have a world, what good is it going to do you?”  __  Science writer Seth Borenstein, multimedia journalist Martha Irvine and data journalist Angeliki Kastanis contributed to this report.  __  Read more in the AP’s Trump Country series here .",10.0,15.0

1416,3036,11,4,2017,2017-11-04,Associated Press News,Trump calls Japan ‘crucial ally’ as he kicks off Asia trip,"President Donald Trump, left, greets Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Kasumigaseki Country Club, Sunday, Nov. 5, 2017, in Kawagoe, Japan. Trump is on a five country trip through Asia traveling to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)  FUSSA, Japan (AP) — President Donald Trump praised Japan as a “crucial ally” and warned adversaries not to test America’s resolve Sunday as he opened a grueling and consequential first trip to Asia.  Trump landed at Yokota Air Base on the outskirts of Tokyo and was greeted by cheering service members. Trump then donned a bomber jacket for a speech in which he touted American firepower and the U.S. alliance with Japan.  “Japan is a treasured partner and crucial ally of the United States and today we thank them for welcoming us and for decades of wonderful friendship between our two nations,” he said, speaking in front of an American flag inside an airplane hangar.  Trump was expected to spend much of his 12-day, five-country Asian tour exhorting allies and rivals to step up efforts to counter the dangers posed by North Korea, which continues to move forward with its nuclear weapons program. Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have been engaged in an escalating war of words, with Trump repeatedly referring to Un as “Little Rocket Man” and threatening in a recent speech to “totally destroy” the nation, if necessary.  Even before he landed, Trump used the first moments of the trip to denounce the North as “a big problem” that must “be solved.”  President Donald Trump and the first lady departed Hawaii for Japan, the first stop on his 12-day trip to Asia, where he will exhort allies and rivals on the need to counter the dangers posed by North Korea's nuclear threat. (Nov. 4)  “There’s been 25 years of total weakness, so we are taking a very much different approach” toward the North, he told reporters traveling with him.  During the speech, Trump did not mention North Korea by name, but warned of the consequences of crossing what he called the “most fearsome fighting force in the history of our world.”  “Together with our allies, America’s warriors are prepared to defend our nation using the full range of our unmatched capabilities. No one — no dictator, no regime and no nation — should underestimate, ever, American resolve,” Trump told the troops.  Some regional analysts have speculated that Trump’s presence in Asia may prompt North Korea to take provocative action, like another missile test. Trump, when asked about that possibility aboard Air Force One, said “we’ll soon find out.”  After the speech, Trump flew by helicopter to the Kasumigaseki Country Club about 20 miles outside of Tokyo for lunch and a round of golf with Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Japanese golfer Hideki Matsuyama. An avid golfer, Trump said Matsuyama is “probably the greatest player in the history of Japan.”  Trump and Abe have struck up a personal friendship, forged through multiple meetings and telephone conversations, as well as on the greens of one of Trump’s Florida golf clubs and over intimate dinners at Trump’s Florida estate.  At the club, the leaders signed white caps inscribed with the phrase, “Donald and Shinzo: Make Alliance Even Greater,” a tribute to the U.S.-Japan friendship and a play on Trump’s campaign slogan. On the menu: a hamburger made from U.S. beef.  The trip, which marks the longest Far East itinerary for a president in a generation, comes at a precarious moment for Trump. Days ago, his former campaign chairman was indicted and another adviser pleaded guilty as part of an investigation into possible collusion between Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russian officials.  The journey will also test Trump’s stamina. But the 71-year-old president assured reporters that he was up for the task. “It’s grueling, they tell me, but fortunately that’s historically not been a problem for me. One thing you people will say, that’s not been a problem,” he said.  The visit will be closely watched by Asian allies worried that Trump’s inward-looking “America First” agenda could cede power in the region to China. They also are rattled by his bellicose rhetoric toward North Korea. The North’s growing missile arsenal threatens several of the capitals Trump will visit.  The trip will also put Trump in face-to-face meetings with authoritarian leaders for whom he has expressed admiration. They include China’s Xi Jinping, whom Trump has likened to “a king,” and the Philippines’ Rodrigo Duterte, who has sanctioned the extrajudicial killings of drug dealers.  Trump is also expected to have a second private audience with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of a summit in Vietnam. Trump told reporters he “will want Putin’s help” in dealing with North Korea. They previously met during a summit in Europe this summer.  The White House has signaled that Trump will push American economic interests in the region, but the North Korea issue is expected to dominate the trip. One of Trump’s two major speeches will come before the National Assembly in Seoul. But fiery threats against the North could resonate differently than they do from the distance of Washington.  Trump will forgo a trip to the Demilitarized Zone, the stark border between North and South Korea. All U.S. presidents except one since Ronald Reagan have visited the DMZ in a sign of solidarity with Seoul. The White House contends that Trump’s commitment to South Korea is already crystal clear, as evidenced by his war of words with Kim and his threats to deliver “fire and fury” to North Korea if it does not stop threatening American allies.  The escalation of rhetoric, a departure from the conduct of past presidents, has undermined confidence in the U.S. as a stabilizing presence in Asia.  “There’s a danger if there is a lot of muscle flexing,” said Mike Chinoy, a senior fellow at the U.S.-China Institute at the University of Southern California. “Trump has been going right up to the edge and I wouldn’t rule out some sort of forceful North Korean reaction to Trump’s presence in the region,” he said.  The White House said Trump would be undeterred.  “The president will use whatever language he wants to use, obviously,” White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster told reporters before Trump departed Washington. “I don’t think the president really modulates his language, have you noticed?”  ___  Colvin reported from Tokyo.

192,1156,9,20,2017,2017-09-20,The New York Times,Confident Fed Sets Stage for December Rate Increase,"But other economic measures paint a contrasting picture. Job growth remains strong, suggesting that the work force is still expanding; wage growth is modest, suggesting employers are still able to find workers with relative ease; and inflation weakened in recent months, puzzling Fed officials and economists who had predicted that prices would begin to rise more quickly as labor market conditions tightened.  The Fed’s preferred measure of price inflation increased by just 1.4 percent during the 12 months ending in July, the most recent available data. The Fed is likely to undershoot its target of 2 percent annual inflation for the sixth consecutive year. That has caused consternation among some economists and Fed officials, who are wary of raising rates given the Fed’s inability so far to achieve its inflation objectives.  “I can’t say this year that I can easily point to a sufficient set of factors” to explain low inflation, Ms. Yellen said Wednesday. She added, however, that low inflation this year did not imply low inflation next year. “What we need to do is figure out whether the factors that have lowered inflation are going to prove persistent,” she said.  Ms. Yellen said that weak inflation readings earlier this year “reflect developments that are largely unrelated to broader economic conditions.” Similarly, she said that the Fed expected the impact of hurricanes on gas prices to increase inflation temporarily. So far, the Fed’s assessment of underlying conditions remains unchanged: Ms. Yellen and her colleagues expect inflation to stabilize at its target of 2 percent a year.  The Fed wants to use its benchmark rate to manage economic conditions while gradually draining its investment portfolio in the background. When Ms. Yellen described the Fed’s plans in June, she expressed hope that the process would be like “watching paint dry.”  The Fed holds about $4.2 trillion in Treasury securities and mortgage bonds, which it accumulated to put downward pressure on interest rates. It must regularly replenish its holdings as bonds mature. Beginning in October, it plans to withhold $10 billion a month from the reinvestment process — in effect causing that much money to disappear.  It will then increase the pace by $10 billion each quarter until reaching a monthly rate of $50 billion, and then maintain that pace until it reaches an unspecified finishing line.",5.0,7.0

The congressional plan presented on Thursday, which would abolish a $7,500 federal income-tax credit for electric vehicles, arrives just as automakers are gearing up to expand their lineups.  The credit for purchases of all-electric and plug-in hybrid cars has been a key incentive for consumers to consider switching from traditional gasoline-powered models.  The credit has also helped automakers stimulate the market for electrified models, as well as cover their costs as they build a customer base.",31.0,51.0
