1187,2785,10,30,2018,2018-10-30,Vox,It’s been more than 100 days and Puerto Rico is still in the longest blackout in US history,"Hundreds of thousands of Americans across Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands rang in the new year in darkness, still mired in the longest blackout in US history.  It’s been more than 100 days since Hurricane Maria ravaged the electrical grids of these two US territories, but 14,815 utility customers in the US Virgin Islands, more than a quarter of the total customers, still don’t have electricity. In Puerto Rico, 675,000 customers, or 43 percent of the total, lack power.  The blackout stemming from Hurricane Maria was already the longest in US history back in October, according to an assessment by the Rhodium Group, a policy analysis firm.  Rhodium compared the power outages stemming from Hurricane Maria as of October 26 with those from other events in US history. As you can see, Hurricane Maria disrupted electricity more than any other event by a long shot:  Peter Marsters, a research analyst at the Rhodium Group, explained that the numbers reflect how many utility customers lost power multiplied by how long they were without power.  And the term “customer” obscures the true impact of these outages. A household of two and a household of 10 both count as one customer each, since there’s usually only one electricity bill per home.  This represents 43% of all customers on the island (remember, 1 customer=1 meter, not 1 person). 105 days and counting. https://t.co/hPwqEUeyTK — Shayle Kann (@shaylekann) January 4, 2018  It’s worth noting that of the top 10 outages, nine were due to hurricanes, and eight occurred after 2000. This is in part due the fact that populations are growing and more are living in harm’s way, increasing the impact of extreme weather. That’s part of what made 2017 the most expensive year ever for natural disasters in the United States.  Though power grids across the country do try to anticipate blackouts, they only prepare for disruptions measured in minutes, not days, weeks, or months.  “These mostly weather-driven events are magnitudes above [outages in] day-to-day grid operation,” Marsters said.  In Puerto Rico and the USVI, the outages have led to ongoing health and environmental crises as idled sanitation systems have forced some to drink from contaminated wells and other water sources. The power losses are making it more difficult to contain hazardous waste.  The outages have proved deadly, with people unable to use lifesaving medical equipment like dialysis machines, and they’ve contributed to Puerto Rico’s official death toll of 64.  As we’ve reported here at Vox, the actual number of fatalities is likely much higher, a development that has prompted lawmakers to ask for an audit. BuzzFeed also reported that there have been more than 900 cremations across the island since the hurricane without medical examination.  And electricity may not be restored fully in Puerto Rico and the USVI until May, since emergency managers are still reeling from the devastation across the United States in 2017, spreading thin reconstruction supplies like utility poles and power lines across all disaster areas spanning from California to Florida.  Vox’s Alexia Fernández Campbell reported that the Puerto Rican government’s own missteps in the reconstruction effort, including botching a massive recovery contract with Whitefish Energy, have further hampered the power restoration effort.  Such outages also carry a massive price tag for the economy.  The financial services firm Allianz estimated that a 30-minute power loss costs an average of $15,709 per customer for medium and large industrial facilities, while an eight-hour outage costs an average of $94,000.  “Even short blackouts — which occur several times a year in the US — add up to an annual estimated economic loss of between US$104 and US$164 billion,” the firm found.  The power losses will also have huge financial consequences for Puerto Rico, which was already in dire economic straits before the storm.  Outages from Hurricane Maria are also having knock-on effects. As Vox’s Yochi Dreazen reported from Puerto Rico, the power losses are “significantly slowing the entire US relief effort, and preventing other vital parts of the island’s battered infrastructure from coming back online.”  Power restoration work in these hurricane-hit territories is proving slow, sporadic, and expensive. Much of the infrastructure has been physically knocked down, and hardware has to come in through ports that are already clogged with relief supplies.  While there has been some progress in getting the lights back on and entrepreneurs are using the region to enact their vision for a cleaner, more resilient power grid, most in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands are relying on stopgap measures like gasoline-powered generators.  “These numbers are going to rise,” Marsters said. “Every customer-hour loss adds to the cumulative total.”",3.5135135135135136,37,"[2.5, 1.0, 1.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 0.5, 3.0, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 2.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 0.5, 2.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.5, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 0.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.0, 2.0, 4.5, 5.0, 4.5]"

Politico’s Matthew Nausbaum started the conversation:  I’m wondering if there’s any concern in the White House that the president’s frequent use of the term “fake news” to describe mainstream outlets muddies the water a little bit and makes it harder for citizens to identify the actual fake news that the intelligence agencies have said countries like Russia used to interfere in the last election.  Sanders confirmed that the president was frustrated by stories that he considered inaccurate.  “We see a problem with any stories that are inaccurate or untruthful being presented to the American people as facts,” she said.  CNN’s Jim Acosta responded, challenging the president’s belief in the First Amendment.  Sarah, why did the president tweet this morning that he’d like to see the Senate Intelligence Committee investigate news outlets – In, I guess, this quest to go after fake news, does he value the First Amendment as much he values the Second Amendment?  “Absolutely. The president is an incredible advocate of the First Amendment,” Sanders replied. “With the First Amendment, with those freedoms also come responsibilities, and you have a responsibility, to tell the truth, to be accurate.”  Sanders cited statistics showing that only five percent of the media’s coverage was positive about the president, despite good news in the stock market, job numbers, cutting regulations and the war against ISIS.  “Frankly, those are the issues most Americans care about; not a lot of the things that you cover, not a lot of the petty palace intrigue that you spend your time on,” she said to Acosta.  Trey Yingst of One America News asked Sanders if she thought the president wanted to see the Senate Intelligence Committee investigate media organizations.  “I don’t know that that’s the case,” she said. “But I do think that we should call on all media to a higher standard.”",2.0,2,"[0.5, 3.5]"

How many of those same women were simultaneously begging Harvey Weinstein, who was apparently a well known sexual predator, for a job?  Well, today Harvey got some very bad news…  Harvey Weinstein, the disgraced co-founder and CEO of The Weinstein Company, has been fired effective immediately, his board of directors said on Sunday.  The statement said:  “In light of new information about misconduct by Harvey Weinstein that has emerged in the past few days, the directors of The Weinstein Company – Robert Weinstein, Lance Maerov, Richard Koenigsberg and Tarak Ben Ammar – have determined, and have informed Harvey Weinstein, that his employment with The Weinstein Company is terminated, effective immediately.”  The company has been under intense pressure since The New York Times broke an investigative story on Thursday detailing three decades of sexual misconduct, including propositioning actresses and harassing female employees. More ugly stories continued to dribble out over the weekend, including a vulgar report by a news anchor that Weinstein masturbated in front of her and other stories of inappropriate propositions.  Internally Weinstein continued to fight for his survival, insiders have told TheWrap. His advisors – including his brother Bob – told him that he needed to take the allegations seriously and not merely pay lip service. They wanted him to leave for six months and get treatment for sex addiction or whatever his behavior may be called.  Weinstein told TheWrap in an interview on Thursday that he was sincere in his apology and intention to make amends. But reports continued to leak out of the company internally that the CEO was determined to dictate the terms of his leave of absence and treatment.  Harvey and Bob Weinstein co-founded the indie film company Miramax in 1979 and grew it into a powerhouse brand that made art-house films mainstream — and reshaped the Academy Awards race with aggressive marketing and buzz.  The company was bought by Disney in 1993, where the brothers continued to run the company — and dominate the Oscar race — until they left in 2005 to launch the new privately held The Weinstein Company.

Mr. “Broom” and Mr. “Vraspir” are being sued for alleged violation of Fortnite‘s Terms of Service and End-User License Agreement. Their modification of the game’s code for the purpose of cheating in the “action-building” co-operative shooter is considered copyright infringement by the game’s creator, claiming, “the software that Defendant uses to cheat infringes Epic’s copyrights in the game and breaches the terms of the agreements to which Defendant agreed in order to have access to the game.”  The Fortnite team has been aggressively banning supposed cheaters in the short time following release of the freemium “Battle Royale” mode for their game. In an official blog post by Community Coordinator Nathan Mooney, he wrote:  Addressing cheaters in Fortnite is the highest priority across Epic Games. We are constantly working against both the cheaters themselves and the cheat providers. And it’s ongoing, we’re exploring every measure to ensure these cheaters are removed and stay removed from Fortnite Battle Royale and the Epic ecosystem. [emphasis original]  Epic’s allegations against Broom and Vraspir are much more concrete:  Defendant’s cheating, and his inducing and enabling of others to cheat, is ruining the game playing experience of players who do not cheat. The software that Defendant uses to cheat infringes Epic’s copyrights in the game and breaches the terms of the agreements to which Defendant agreed in order to have access to the game. As a result of his conduct, Defendant has been banned from playing Fortnite at least nine times. He nevertheless continues to play by creating multiple new accounts using false names to circumvent these bans. He also continued to cheat and induce others to cheat at Fortnite.  Both defendants are reportedly involved with the site AddictedCheats.net, with Vraspir allegedly providing code for the cheats and Broom reportedly admitting that he wanted to sow “unwanted chaos and disorder.” He has further reportedly said that AddictedCheats.net was specifically targeting Fortnite.  Both Broom and Vraspir face $150,000 in statutory damages for copyright infringement, breach of contract, and “circumvention of technological measures.” If nothing else, these suits show just how serious gaming companies are about having their businesses attacked.

The EU on Monday Nov. 13, 2017 banned arms sales to Venezuela and set up a system to slap asset freezes and travel restrictions on Venezuelan officials as it seeks to ramp up pressure on President Nicolas Maduro. The move was decided by EU foreign ministers at talks in Brussels. (AP Photo/Ariana Cubillos, File)  CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Foreign investors walked a red carpet at a state palace Monday eager to hear strategies for reorganizing Venezuela’s billions in debt, but they left minutes later having learned no concrete plans to address the country’s financial crisis.  Vice President Tareck El Aissami, who headed the talks, used much of his time to rail against U.S. President Donald Trump and foreign lenders for leading what the government calls an “economic war” against this oil-rich nation.  But he also tried to assure creditors that debts will continue to be paid, echoing statements by President Nicolas Maduro that Venezuela has made more than $70 billion in debt payments since 2013.  “The state has fully honored its national and international commitments, especially with regard to external debt service,” El Aissami said in a televised broadcast. “Even with great sacrifice, we have paid every penny of our debt service.”  Those few investors who bothered to show up had few expectations for the meeting, which from the start was clouded in confusion.  Maduro invited investors to Caracas a little more than a week ago while announcing his goal of renegotiating a foreign debt that he said has become impossible to repay because of a U.S.-led financial “blockade” of the socialist-run country.  As Venezuela spent heavily on social programs under the late President Hugo Chavez, a time when global oil prices soared, its debt skyrocketed to over $120 billion, about half of which is in the form of dollar-denominated bonds. The drop in crude prices has ravaged the country that sits atop the world’s largest oil reserves, leading to widespread shortages amid triple-digit inflation.  Strained relations between Venezuela and the United States are compounding the situation.  The Trump administration has sanctioned a growing list of Venezuelan officials, including the government’s top two debt negotiators, Economy Minister Simon Zerpa and El Aissami. The vice president is accused of being a major drug trafficker.  Washington has also barred U.S. companies from lending new money to Venezuela because of human rights abuses committed during months of anti-government protests and Maduro’s efforts to squash the opposition.  But in a sign the Trump administration might be willing to soften its stance, the Treasury Department said last week that it would consider allowing Americans to deal in new debt if any restructuring plan was backed by Venezuela’s opposition-controlled congress, whose authority has been steadfastly ignored by Maduro’s government.  Russ Dallen, managing partner of Caracas Capital Markets, said several U.S. investors he represents told him they wouldn’t bother attending. One said he couldn’t get a visa on such short notice and another reported planning to send an intern, citing the lack of information.  “You’d think they’d put it on the table and let you study it if there was some kind of proposal,” Dallen said. “There’s nothing. Just crickets.”  Also Monday, at an informal meeting to discuss Venezuela at the U.N. Security Council, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley called Venezuela “an increasingly violent narco-state” that threatens the world.  Venezuela’s U.N. ambassador, Rafael Ramirez, responded by denouncing the session.  “This is a hostile act from the United States and an interference that violates the sovereignty principles of a country that is a member of the United Nations,” he told reporters.  In Brussels earlier in the day, the European Union banned arms sales to Venezuela and set up a system to slap asset freezes and travel restrictions on Venezuelan officials as it seeks to ramp up pressure on Maduro. The weapons ban would stop sales of military equipment that could be used for repression or surveillance of Venezuelans.",3.5,1,[3.5]
1623,3378,11,13,2017,2017-11-13,Associated Press News,Trump does not publicly rebuke Duterte for drug war killings,"President Donald Trump speaks with Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte at an ASEAN Summit dinner at the SMX Convention Center, Sunday, Nov. 12, 2017, in Manila, Philippines. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)  MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has sanctioned a bloody drug war that features extrajudicial killing. He called Barack Obama a “son of a whore.” This week, he boasted that he murdered a man with his own hands.  All that went unmentioned in public by President Donald Trump when the leaders held talks Monday in the Philippines.  Reporters saw the beginning of the leaders’ bilateral meeting during which Trump praised Duterte’s hospitality, the organization of the summit he was hosting and even Manila’s weather. Trump said nothing about human rights and both leaders ignored shouted questions about the violent drug crackdown. The two men also shared a laugh in the meeting when Duterte called reporters “spies.”  Later, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that the 40-minute meeting focused on ISIS, illegal drugs, and trade. Human rights, she added, briefly came up in the context of the Philippines’ fight against illegal drugs. She did not say if Trump was critical of the violence.  That appeared to conflict with the Philippines’ version of the meeting. Harry Roque, a spokesman for Duterte, said “there was no mention of human rights. There was no mention of extralegal killings. There was only a rather lengthy discussion of the Philippine war on drugs with President Duterte doing most of the explaining.”  Breaking with his presidential predecessors, Trump has largely abandoned publicly pressing foreign leaders on human rights, instead showing a willingness to embrace international strongmen for strategic gain. He has cozied up to autocrats such as Saudi Arabia’s King Salman, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi and Russian President Vladimir Putin. And earlier in this trip to Asia he made no mention of human rights during multiple appearances in Beijing with Chinese President Xi Jinping.  “Trump seems very comfortable with strongmen. It’s not just that he won’t criticize Duterte. I wouldn’t be surprised if he patted him on the back,” said Mike Chinoy, senior fellow at U.S.-China Institute at the University of Southern California, before the meeting.  Duterte’s war on drugs has alarmed human rights advocates around the world who say it has allowed police officers and vigilantes to ignore due process and to take justice into their own hands. Government officials estimate that well over 3,000 people, mostly drug users and dealers, have died in the ongoing crackdown. Human rights groups believe the victim total is far higher, perhaps closer to 9,000.  “Human rights groups, I think, will be quite disappointed by the visit,” said Amy Searight, director of the Southeast Asia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “It’s unlikely that human rights or rule of law or due process are going to be topics that President Trump will raise.”  Duterte has strenuously defended the violence and boasted of participating himself.  Late last year, he bragged that he personally pulled the trigger and killed three people years ago while serving as mayor of Davao City. And last week, while in Vietnam for an international summit, he said he took his first life years earlier.  “When I was a teenager, I had been in and out of jail, rumble here and there,” Duterte said during a speech in Danang, where he briefly crossed paths with Trump on the sidelines of an international summit. “At the age of 16, I already killed someone.”  He claimed he fatally stabbed the person “just over a look.” His spokesman later tried to downplay the comment, saying, “I think it was in jest.”  Trump has shown little interest in pressuring Duterte to rein in the violence, instead saluting him during a May phone call.  “I just wanted to congratulate you because I am hearing of the unbelievable job on the drug problem,” Trump told Duterte, according to a transcript of the conversation that later leaked. “Many countries have the problem, we have a problem, but what a great job you are doing and I just wanted to call and tell you that.”  Trump also criticized Obama during the call, noting that his predecessor “did not understand” the drug problem the Philippines faces. Meanwhile, Duterte was openly critical of Obama in the final year of his presidency, including cursing his name.  White House officials have suggested there is a strategy behind Trump’s flattery of Duterte.  Advisers have said that while Trump was always unlikely to publicly chastise the Philippine president, he may offer criticisms behind closed doors. Trump would plan to hold his tongue in public in order not to embarrass Duterte, whom he is urging to help pressure North Korea and fight terrorism, and to avoid pushing him into the arms of China.  “If the administration is not going to care about human rights in China, why would you care in the Philippines?” asked Gordon Chang, Asia expert and author of “Nuclear Showdown: North Korea Takes On the World.” He said the “logical thing to do is keep them close and not let Duterte flirt with China. In our struggle with China, we need all the friends when we can get.”  Duterte has seemed less committed to the strategic partnership with the U.S. Searight said a good relationship is “vital to the United States given its location on the South China Sea and the enhanced access that the American military has gotten in recent years with the Philippines.”  White House aides have suggested that Trump’s strategy has worked before, pointing to his interactions with el-Sissi. Trump refrained from chastising the Egyptian leader but quietly worked with him to help engineer the release of American prisoner Aya Hijazi in April.  Trump dismissed the notion that he buddied up to dictators. He said Saturday he has great relationships with all sorts of leaders, “every person in that room today,” after leaving a summit in Vietnam attended by Duterte and Putin, among others.  Human rights groups have expressed dismay at Trump’s public silence, believing that the spotlight an American president can shine on human rights abuses overseas can rally pressure on an authoritarian regime to change its ways.  “In the old days, we used to call on the U.S. government to raise human rights issues during these trips,” said John Sifton, Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch. But given the administration’s lack of credibility in raising human rights abuses, he said, they have pivoted to a different tack, focusing on international attention.  “We haven’t given up,” Sifton said.  ___  Associated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report.  ___  Follow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire",4.625,4,"[5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.5]"

The rocket is carrying cargo to the International Space Station. (AP Photo/Steve Helber)  CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — A stash of frozen treats and other supplies rocketed toward the International Space Station on Sunday, this time from Virginia’s cold eastern shore.  NASA’s commercial shipper, Orbital ATK, launched the cargo ship just after sunrise from Wallops Island, aboard an unmanned Antares rocket.  The Cygnus capsule should reach the orbiting lab Tuesday. It’s loaded with 7,400 pounds of cargo, including sweet treats for the six station astronauts. There are frozen fruit bars, ice cream bars, ice cream sandwiches and cups of chocolate and vanilla ice cream — about 80 in all, according to NASA.  The crew expects pizza as well. Italian astronaut Paolo Nespoli has been craving pizza for months.  “Pizza and ice cream on the way!” NASA astronaut Joe Acaba tweeted following liftoff. “Eagerly awaiting the arrival.”  This marked Orbital ATK’s first launch from its home turf in more than a year. The last time it made a space station delivery, it used another company’s rocket flying from Cape Canaveral, Florida.  Crowds gathered at Wallops in freezing temperatures and cheered as the rocket soared toward the southeast. Sunrise made it hard to see the launch farther afield. The field of visibility stretched from New England to the Carolinas.  A launch attempt on Saturday was nixed after a plane strayed into the restricted airspace. Sunday’s try was almost foiled by a couple of boats that briefly wandered into the keep-out zone.  Orbital ATK named the capsule after the last man to walk on the moon, Apollo 17′s Gene Cernan, who died in January. During the final minutes of the countdown, a launch controller paid tribute to Cernan as well as J.R. Thompson, a high-ranking NASA and Orbital ATK official who died last week.  The capsule will remain at the space station until the beginning of December, when it’s cut loose for a test of close proximity flying, a series of mini satellite deployments and, lastly, a fiery re-entry with a load of trash.

Speaking by phone to Breitbart News on Saturday, Corfman’s mother, Nancy Wells, 71, further stated that her daughter would not have come forward if it weren’t for The Post reporter’s alleged actions.  Earlier on Sunday, Breitbart News reported that Corfman’s mother contradicted a key detail of Corfman’s story. Speaking by phone to Breitbart News on Saturday, Wells said that her daughter did not have a phone in her bedroom during the period that Moore is reported to have allegedly called Corfman – purportedly on Corfman’s bedroom phone – to arrange at least one encounter.  The Washington Post cited Corfman as remembering that she provided Moore with her number when she was 14. She said that she spoke to Moore from what she described as the phone in her bedroom.  Today, the left got some very bad new about their hit job on Roy Moore…it appears that polls show Alabama voters aren’t buying it…  Breitbart News – Two new polls demonstrate that GOP nominee for the U.S. Senate Judge Roy Moore remains unaffected entirely by smears in the Washington Post against him, and his lead before the Post piece on Thursday afternoon remains intact.  One of the polls, which were both provided by the pollster to Breitbart News exclusively on Saturday evening, was conducted on Thursday morning before the publication of the Post piece that afternoon. The second one was conducted on Saturday evening. Together, they show Judge Moore’s lead over Democrat Doug Jones has been virtually unaffected since the Post story came out.  The first survey, which was conducted entirely before noon local time on Thursday, shows Moore leading Jones by 50 percent to 39.2 percent with 10.8 percent undecided. That survey of 1,354 likely voters in the upcoming Dec. 12 special election has a margin of error of 3.5 percent.  The second survey, conducted Saturday evening—two days after the Post piece hit, roiling Alabama’s political scene—shows Moore and Jones with about the exact same percentages as before. Moore’s position in this second poll is 49.8 percent—meaning he only dropped 0.2 percent since the story hit—and Jones has only picked up 0.4 percent to reach 39.6 percent total. The second survey, which polled 1,536 likely voters with a margin of error of 3.3 percent, has 10.5 percent as undecided.  “The polling between Thursday morning and Saturday showed far less movement than I originally expected,” pollster John Wahl told Breitbart News. “The controversy surrounding the Washington Post article seems to have galvanized the support of both candidates, but not changed the actual percentages in a significant manner. The Moore campaign has already weathered a considerable amount of political attacks during this campaign season, and I expect most of his lightest support to have blown off during these attacks. His current support level is holding fairly steady.”  Another liberal publication, The Hill, reported that Moore was losing in the polls to Jones after the hit piece on Moore was published in the Washington Post.  The Hill -Democrat Doug Jones is leading Republican Roy Moore in Alabama’s Senate race in the wake of explosive accusations of sexual misconduct against Moore, according to a new poll released Sunday.  Forty-six percent of likely voters polled said they would vote for Jones, while 42 percent said they would vote for Moore, according to the Louisiana-based JMC Analytics and Polling.  The survey was conducted on Nov. 9 and Nov. 11, after The Washington Post reported that a woman said Moore had initiated a sexual encounter with her in 1979, when she was 14 years old and he was 32.

According to a Thursday, Nov. 9 Washington Post story an Alabama woman said Moore made inappropriate advances and had sexual contact with her when she was 14. Moore has denied the allegations. (AP Photo/Brynn Anderson)  For many evangelicals, fiery Alabama politician and judge Roy Moore has been a longtime hero. Others have sometimes cringed at his heated rhetoric and bellicose style.  Now, as Moore’s U.S. Senate campaign is imperiled by allegations of sexual overtures to a 14-year-old girl when he was in his 30s, there’s an outpouring of impassioned and soul-searching discussion in evangelical ranks.  “This is one of those excruciating decision moments for evangelicals,” Albert Mohler, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, said in a telephone interview. “These allegations, if true, are devastating. If true, this is a very big deal.”  Mohler said Alabama voters face a potentially wrenching task of trying to determine if the allegations — Moore has emphatically denied them — are credible.  According the Pew Research Center, 49 percent of Alabama adults are evangelical Protestants. For some of them, the Moore allegations echo the quandary they faced last year, wrestling over whether to support Donald Trump in the presidential race despite his crude sexual boasts.  The Rev. Robert Franklin, professor of moral leadership at Emory University’s Candler School of Theology in Atlanta, said The Washington Post’s report about the Moore allegations represents a test of “moral consistency” for evangelicals.  “Evangelicals are steadily losing their moral authority in the larger public square by intensifying their uncritical loyalty to Donald Trump,” Franklin wrote in an email. “Since this is Roy Moore and not Donald Trump, I think there may be significant disaffection with him, and increased demands for his removal from the ballot.”  As for Moore himself, Franklin suggested there were “classic evangelical remedies” such as confession, prayer and remorse and isolation.  “Election to higher office is not one of them,” Franklin wrote.  Although Trump won 80 percent of the white evangelical vote in his presidential victory, his candidacy exposed and hardened rifts among conservative Christians about partisan politics, the personal character of government leaders and the Gospel. Surveys by the Public Religion Research Institute found that the percentage of white evangelicals who said they still trusted the leadership of a politician who commits an immoral act rose from 30 percent in 2011 to 72 percent last year.  Still, a solid minority of conservative Christians adopted the #NeverTrump hashtag on social media and joined those outside of evangelicalism who said “values voters” had lost their values. Women and black evangelicals especially emerged as critics of Trump’s remarks about women, immigrants, African-Americans and Muslims. Many of these same critics of Trump’s behavior and rhetoric condemned Moore in recent days, and bemoaned the fact that some evangelicals were standing by him.  “Okay, seriously, we elected a man president who bragged about using his power and authority to sexually assault women,” tweeted Kyle James Howard, an African-American student at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. “Why are we surprised that members of his party would now be defending a party member’s sexual assault of a minor?”  One of the Southern Baptist Convention’s leading public policy experts, the Rev. Russell Moore, expressed dismay after the allegations against Judge Moore — no relation — surfaced on Thursday.  “Whether in the hills of Hollywood or the halls of power, it doesn’t matter,” Rev. Moore tweeted. “This is true: sexual assault and child molestation are evil, unjust, satanic.”  Roy Moore embraced controversy as he built his evangelical following. He was twice removed from his post as Alabama’s chief justice, once for disobeying a federal court order to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the lobby of the state judicial building, and later for urging probate judges to defy the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage.  Among those declining to break with Moore in the wake of the sex allegations was Jerry Falwell Jr., president of evangelical Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia.  “It comes down to a question of who is more credible in the eyes of the voters — the candidate or the accuser,” Falwell told Religion News Service. “And I believe the judge is telling the truth.”  Mohler, the seminary president, said many evangelical Alabama voters will find themselves facing a difficult choice when ballots are cast in the Dec. 12 special election.  “There’s so much at stake,” he said. “Those of us who are pro-life have got to be very concerned about losing even one seat in the U.S. Senate.”  The Democratic candidate in the special election, Doug Jones, has said that a decision on whether to have an abortion should generally be left to the woman in question.  Abortion policy also was evoked by Ed Cyzewski, a Kentucky-based seminary graduate and author, in a series of Twitter posts Friday questioning why some of his fellow evangelicals would continue to stand by Moore.  “Right now there are evangelicals who feel trapped,” Cyzewski wrote. “They think Moore did something reprehensible, but believe abortion is evil.”  Katelyn Beaty, an editor at large with the evangelical magazine Christianity Today, suggested that among many of Moore’s evangelical supporters, there’s a “presumption of innocence” because of their mistrust of national media such as The Washington Post.  “Many Christian communities have trouble appropriately responding to sex abuse allegations,” Beaty wrote in an email. “There is a default trust in powerful, charismatic male leaders, coupled with a discomfort with women who use their story or voice to challenge the status quo or power structures.”  However, Beaty said more moderate evangelicals — notably those critical of Trump — were likely dismayed by the allegations against Moore.  “For them, the defense of Moore is another sign that both evangelicalism and the GOP have lost their credibility and their souls in the pursuit of power,” she wrote.  ___  AP Religion Writer Rachel Zoll in New York contributed to this report.",3.0,1,[3.0]
1609,3346,11,12,2017,2017-11-12,Fox News,Senate tax bill throws swamp water on successful Trump economy,"Leave it to the Senate to take a flaming hot Trump economy and throw swamp water on it! The booming stock market speaks for itself. President Trump has our economy rolling and now the Senate comes along with ""business as usual"" tactics to mess things up. Free-market lovers will never stand for this!  The version of tax reform legislation unveiled by Senate Republicans on Thursday is another indication that the swamp is alive and well. This is a repeat performance of the failure of Congress to get health care done.    The Senate GOP has proposed a version of the tax bill that delays the corporate tax rate reduction from 35 percent to 20 percent until 2019 – contrary to the version supported by House Republicans that would create that desperately needed economic stimulus tax rate cut in 2018.  Effectively, the Senate tax bill calls for a slightly lower top tax rate for individuals of 38.5 percent, versus the 39.6 percent in the House bill. The Senate measure also would double the estate tax exemption, but not repeal the tax, as House Republicans proposed.  The Senate version keeps the deduction for medical expenses, while the House bill eliminates it.  The duration of real estate depreciation will be reduced from 39 years to 25 years. This initiative alone will create another real estate asset bubble like the 1980s, where the rush to invest in real estate was not matched with economic demand. This in turn created a supply-side bubble – not enough tenants to fill the buildings and a subsequent mortgage default, followed by the savings and loan crisis.  The scoring of the proposed Senate tax bill shows this will cost the federal government $5.8 trillion in reduced revenue over 10 years, adding to the national debt.  The controversy surrounding the blue states state and local tax deduction is also eliminated entirely in the Senate bill. This is contrary to the deal the House put forth after bending to pressure from Republicans from New York, New Jersey, Illinois and California, who raised concerns about losing that deduction for their constituents.  Once again, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., capitulated to the needs of a few American taxpayers. Once again, the special interests win, not the American voter.  The inability of Republicans in Congress to come to a consensus on a tax bill is reflective of their “repeal and replace” fail during the healthcare bill negotiations.  The increasing pressure to deliver a bill the President Trump can sign illustrates just how purposeful Congress is at enabling gridlock. Congress fails to understand that the voter is engaged and is already mobilizing and supporting candidates for the 2018 election cycle who support the president’s agenda.  Another failure to deliver a bill that President Trump campaigned for will only result in support for Steve Bannon’s rallying cry for a war on the GOP establishment.  President Trump has done an amazing job of growing our economy. Americans were promised cuts that will stimulate economy, tax simplification (the Senate bill is seven layers high!), and equality (the bracketed differences are socialist, not free market!).  My guess is that those who fought so hard to elect President Trump will NOT let the swamp get away with this!",1.0833333333333333,6,"[0.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 0.5, 1.0]"
1610,3347,11,12,2017,2017-11-12,Breitbart,EXCLUSIVE – Mother of Roy Moore Accuser Contradicts Key Detail of Daughter’s Sexual Misconduct Story," The mother of Leigh Corfman, who says that Alabama Senatorial Candidate Roy Moore tried to engage in a sexual encounter with her when she was 14, has contradicted a key detail of Corfman’s story.  Speaking by phone to Breitbart News on Saturday, Corfman’s mother, Nancy Wells, 71, says that her daughter did not have a phone in her bedroom during the period that Moore is reported to have allegedly called Corfman – purportedly on Corfman’s bedroom phone – to arrange at least one encounter.  Moore strongly denies Corfman’s claims.  The Washington Post, which first published its newsmaking, on-the-record interview with Corfman last week, cited Corfman as remembering that she provided Moore with her number when she was 14. She said that she spoke to Moore from what she described as the phone in her bedroom.  Citing Corfman, the Post reported:  After her mother went into the courtroom, Corfman says, Moore asked her where she went to school, what she liked to do and whether he could call her sometime. She remembers giving him her number and says he called not long after. She says she talked to Moore on her phone in her bedroom, and they made plans for him to pick her up at Alcott Road and Riley Street, around the corner from her house.  Soon after, Corfman said, he called again, and picked her up again at the same spot.  Later on, Corfman described a third phone call:  She says that after their last encounter, Moore called again, but that she found an excuse to avoid seeing him. She says that at some point during or soon after her meetings with Moore, she told two friends in vague terms that she was seeing an older man.  Corfman clearly claimed she spoke to Moore on what she said was “her phone in her bedroom” on at least one of those occasions. The Post did not specify whether the second or third alleged calls purportedly took place on a bedroom phone.  Wells, Corfman’s mother, was asked by Breitbart News: “Back then did she have her own phone in her room or something?”  “No,” she replied matter-of-factly. “But the phone in the house could get through to her easily.”  The Post story relies heavily on Corfman’s memory and her ability to recount events consistently.  The newspaper reported that “Corfman described her story consistently in six interviews with The Post.”  The Post story uses the word “remembers” 10 times when quoting or paraphrasing Corfman.  Here are those 10 times:  1: The Post cited Corfman thusly: “’I wanted it over with — I wanted out,’ she remembers thinking.”  This detail related to Corfman’s claim that Moore drove her to his house, removed his own clothes besides his underwear, took off her shirt and guided her hand to his underwear.  2: During the initial alleged encounter, when Corfman said that Moore was watching her while Corfman’s mother went into the courtroom, the Post reported, “She remembers giving him her number and says he called not long after.”  3: “I remember the further I got from my house, the more nervous I got,” Corfman was quoted as saying when she recalled the alleged drive with Moore from her house.  5 – 7: The Post used the word three times when citing Corfman in the following paragraph:  She remembers an unpaved driveway. She remembers going inside and him giving her alcohol on this visit or the next, and that at some point she told him she was 14. She says they sat and talked. She remembers that Moore told her she was pretty, put his arm around her and kissed her, and that she began to feel nervous and asked him to take her home, which she says he did.  8 – Referring to the alleged sexual encounter, the Post reported:  She remembers that Moore kissed her, that he took off her pants and shirt, and that he touched her through her bra and underpants. She says that he guided her hand to his underwear and that she yanked her hand back.  9 – In that same encounter, the Post relates:  She remembers thinking, “I don’t want to do this” and “I need to get out of here.” She says that she got dressed and asked Moore to take her home, and that he did.  Meanwhile, Wells told Breitbart that she and her daughter stick by the Post’s story. “It’s truthful and it was researched very well,” she said.  Asked if she could remember Moore, then a 32-year-old assistant district attorney, allegedly asking to watch her daughter in 1979 while Wells went into a courtroom, Wells recounted the story essentially the same way she told it to the Post.  Wells told this reporter: “We were sitting in the hall. He came up and started talking to us. We were sitting on a bench waiting to go into court. He said, you know, ‘What are you doing.’ You know, we told him. He is Roy Moore. And he said, ‘You don’t want her to go in there and hear all of the bickering.’ And I said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘I will be glad to stay out here with her and bring her in if she needs to come in.’ And so that is the way it started.”  “Probably if it were in today’s times that never would have happened,” Wells added. “He sounded like someone that I could trust and we were there in the courthouse.”  Corfman described her own troubled background to the Post, including three divorces, bankruptcies and a history of drug abuse.  The Post related:  She says that her teenage life became increasingly reckless with drinking, drugs, boyfriends, and a suicide attempt when she was 16. As the years went on, Corfman says, she did not share her story about Moore partly because of the trouble in her life. She has had three divorces and financial problems. While living in Arizona, she and her second husband started a screen-printing business that fell into debt. They filed for bankruptcy protection three times, once in 1991 with $139,689 in unpaid claims brought by the Internal Revenue Service and other creditors, according to court records.  Moore strongly denied Corfman’s claims. “These allegations are completely false and are a desperate political attack by the National Democrat Party and the Washington Post on this campaign,” Moore said in immediate response to the Post’s story.  Moore’s campaign said in a statement, “This garbage is the very definition of fake news and intentional defamation.”  The campaign pointed out that Moore has been married to his wife, Kayla, for nearly 33 years and has four children and five grandchildren. It also noted that Moore has served in public office in the past and that no such allegations were previously made.  The statement said:  The Judge has been a candidate in four hotly-contested statewide political contests, twice as a gubernatorial candidate and twice as a candidate for chief justice. He has been a three-time candidate for local office, and he has been a national figure in two ground-breaking, judicial fights over religious liberty and traditional marriage.  “After over 40 years of public service, if any of these allegations were true, they surely would have been made public long before now,” the statement continued.  On Saturday, Moore further addressed the allegations:  “Now I want to address something that some people have come here to hear about,” Moore said at a local campaign event. “Shortly after becoming the Republican nominee for the United States Senate, the Washington Post began an attack on the Foundation for Moral Law, on my wife, and on me. For weeks, we read about my salary which they distorted, about taxes where they said we were paid money we never got. But we endured that.”  “Later, they came out and endorsed my opponent in this race,” he continued. “Just two days ago, the Washington Post published yet another attack on my character and reputation in a desperate attempt to stop my political campaign for the United States Senate. These attacks about a minor are completely false and untrue about something that happened nearly 40 years ago. But more than being completely false and untrue, they are very hurtful to me personally.”  “I wanted to make it clear to the media present and the people present, I have not provided alcoholic beverages—beer or anything else—to a minor. I have not been guilty of sexual misconduct with anyone,” he declared. “These allegations came only four and a half weeks before the general election on Dec. 12. Why now?”  “For forty years I have been closely scrutinized in the press and the public media. I have had investigations by the attorney general, I’ve had investigations by the judicial inquiry commission on more than one occasion, I’ve had investigations by the court of the judiciary, I’ve been in five statewide campaigns in which they do opposition research—they do investigations, as you can see in every one I’ve ever run—and three county elections and two major controversies over religious liberty and the Ten Commandments and same-sex marriage,” he continued. “I’ve been investigated more than any other person in this country. That grown women would wait forty years to come right before an election to bring charges is absolutely unbelievable.”  Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

1611,3355,11,12,2017,2017-11-12,Fox News,Alabama pastor defends embattled US Senate candidate Roy Moore,"After a bombshell of sexual misconduct allegations late last week, those close to Alabama U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore are sticking by him.  Pastor Tom Brown of the First Baptist Church of Gallant says Moore has attended the church in Gallant, Ala. for most of his life. He added the community is close-knit and extremely proud of Moore’s run for the Senate, but noted the reported allegations of sexual misconduct have taken a toll on the former judge.  “He’s hurt about what’s been said about him,” Brown told Fox News on Sunday. “He says it’s untrue and I believe it’s untrue because I’ve known him for 25 years.”  As a staunch conservative, Moore has grown a following in the state with Christian conservatives. Brown says Moore attends church at least a few times a month when his schedule allows, but there was no sighting of the candidate ‪on Sunday morning.  Several church members told Fox News that Moore and his family were well-liked in the community.  Daphney Gray attends Moore’s church and said he and his family have been very welcoming to her and her family.  “I have heard things, but I don’t let other people’s opinion sway my opinion,” Gray, who lives in Gallant, said. “I just deal with the man that I see on Sundays and how he has treated my family since we’ve been here.”  Several prominent Republicans including President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have called on Moore to step down if the allegations are true. Others, including Arizona Senator John McCain and former presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have said Moore must drop out of the race completely.  Brown says Moore has a strong following within his community, and that the people who live there are sticking by him.  “When he’s here, we talk to him and tell him we’re praying for him and supporting him,” Brown said.",5.0,1,[5.0]
1612,3358,11,12,2017,2017-11-12,Fox News,Cause for concern? Pro-ISIS hacking group targets 800 US school websites,"The latest target of pro-ISIS hackers is none other than 800 school websites across the United States.  The widespread hack occurred last Monday, and lasted two hours, in which visitors were redirected to a YouTube propaganda video featuring Arabic audio, the text, “I love Islamic State (ISIS)” and images of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.  “Unless we have irrefutable evidence to suggest otherwise, we need to assume confidential data has been compromised,” Hamid Karimi, vice president of business development and the security expert at Beyond Security. “That should be a cause for concern. To remedy the situation, all schools and institutions that serve minors must submit to (a) stricter set of cybersecurity rules.”  The breached school websites, which spanned nationwide from New Jersey to Arizona and Virginia to Connecticut, are all powered by a company called SchoolDesk. The company since has handed over its server — which runs out of Georgia — to the FBI for investigation and also has hired external security firms to trace the hackers. The Atlanta-based company said after the hack that technicians detected that a small file had been injected into the root of one of its websites.  “The websites were redirected to an iframed YouTube video. No data was lost or altered in any way. Because we’re currently working with the FBI in an active investigation of this incident, as well as forensic team from Microsoft, we cannot yet discuss any technical details or exact methods of access to SchoolDesk’s network or software,” a spokesperson for SchoolDesk told Fox News.  The company has insisted that no personal or student information was exposed, but some security experts say the matter should be closely monitored, especially as minors are involved.  “In most hacks, organizations do not have full visibility into what happened or what information was compromised,” surmised Eric Cole, who served as commissioner on cyber security for President Barack Obama, and was formally a senior vice president at MacAfee and the chief scientist at Lockheed Martin. “In almost every breach, what is initially reported is usually extremely conservative and over the weeks following a breach, it is always worse than what was originally reported.”  The proud culprits of the hack? A shadowy pro-ISIS hacktivist outfit known as “Team System DZ.”  Lorraine Murphy of The Cryptosphere, a specialist hacking and malware news site, which long has been tracking Team System DZ, said that the group generally speaking is focused on “making public deface” rather than penetrating systems and getting information, and has been in-motion pre-dating ISIS, going back to at least 2013.  “They used to support freedom for Palestine, #OpFreeGaza, and freedom for Kashmir, and now they support ISIS,” Murphy said. “Team System DZ basically has one trick: take advantage of outdated WordPress sites, and make bold, scary-looking defaces. It’s a trick that has been working for them for three years, and there is no reason to believe that it will stop working anytime soon.”  Over the course of more than three years, the group has hacked vast and a seemingly arbitrary range of thousands of websites across the world — from scores of U.S. government sites including the Washington State Department of Health, the Ohio Department of Administrative Services and the Howard County, Maryland government site, which were replaced with a black screen, Islamic calligraphy, the Call to Prayer and the words: “You will be held accountable, Trump, you and all your people every drop of blood flowing in Muslim countries.” Canada’s Prince Albert police station also was targeted last week, and the city council in Aberdeen, Scotland, and even a local West Yorkshire, England rugby team have been apprehended in the past.  “The wide range of targets all had one common characteristic: they had weak network and web protection,” Karimi pointed out. “It appears that Team DZ was acting opportunistically as opposed to surgically.”  'JIHADI COOL': HOW ISIS SWITCHED ITS RECRUITMENT AND SOCIAL MEDIA MASTER PLAN  Cyber forensic data has indicated that the attacks waged by the group initially came from Algeria, also indicated by the use of the “DZ,” which is the country’s internet domain code.  However, it is likely that they have franchised their defacing operations without a central command, Harimi explained, thus have become both global and difficult to track. For example, Alex Kassirer, director of counterterrorism at intel firm Flashpoint, told Fox News that the group is known to have at least one member from Jordan based on the actor’s pseudonym “zilzal jordan,” with zilzal being the Arabic word for earthquake.  “The threat they pose is largely limited to the propaganda and messaging war,” she continued.  The FBI long have been reported to be investigating the notorious Team System DZ, but declined to comment on the matter. It is believed that no one directly part of the sympathizer hacking group, despite how long they have been operating, are believed to ever have been made.  “What they typically do is cyber-graffiti, they are attempting to spread propaganda on behalf of ISIS to garner support,” noted Dan McNemar, director of threat intelligence at Binary Defense Systems. “A number of pro-ISIS groups have come and gone, Team DZ has certainly been around the longest.”  LEAVE NO MAN BEHIND: EXPERT TEAM PREPARES TO RETRIEVE REMAINS OF FALLEN WWII SERVICEMEN FROM UP TO 350 FEET BELOW ICE  But alliance ties between Team System DZ and ISIS itself remain murky. To date, ISIS has not formally acknowledged the group or indicated they have any authority over the cyber outfit. Yet as long as such hacking groups remain unscathed, so too does the propaganda and recruitment machine — along with their potential to go beyond the realm of website defacement.  “They have not been arrested primarily because they are a low-level operator that is more nuisance than genuine threat at this point. Why waste time on a web defacer, when we can spend time on high value targets instead? But we should be thinking about how these attacks could ‘evolve’ in the future,” added Jeff Bardin, chief information officer of Treadstone 71, a security firm specializing in cyber-threat intelligence and analyzing online jihadists and extremist groups. “To go beyond mere propaganda into more serious territory like cyber extortion and threats.”",3.5,1,[3.5]
1615,3362,11,12,2017,2017-11-12,The New York Times,Trump Health Agency Challenges Consensus on Reducing Costs,"And while Congress passed a bipartisan law in 2015 creating a new payment framework that is supposed to reward doctors for value over volume, Mr. Trump’s Department of Health and Human Services has exempted more doctors from a provision that created merit pay by giving them bonuses or penalties depending on the quality of their work.  In September, the department released an outline of a “new direction” for the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, set up by the Affordable Care Act to test models aimed at improving medical care and reducing costs. While the Obama administration had pushed large, mandatory experiments to test new models of pay, the Trump administration wants to encourage smaller, voluntary programs — and has asked the doctors to help design them.    “Clearly a great big foot has been put on the brake,” said Donald Crane, the chief executive of CAPG, a group of doctors and hospital administrators that, unlike many in the profession, has pushed to tie physician pay to quality measures rather than the old model of fee for service.  Mr. Crane was referring specifically to the scaling back of the cardiac and joint replacement programs by Tom Price, an orthopedic surgeon and Republican former congressman chosen by Mr. Trump as secretary of health and human services. Mr. Price, who resigned in September over his use of expensive private jets, had accused the Obama administration of trying to “commandeer clinical decision-making” by forcing doctors to participate in experiments that test new ways of paying for care. Mr. Trump is said to be close to appointing a successor — possibly Alex Azar, a former pharmaceutical company executive who worked in the Department of Health and Human Services under President George W. Bush — and doctors’ groups will be watching carefully to see if the agency continues in the same direction.  Already, other administration officials have signaled support for protecting doctors and giving them more say. The agency’s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, led by Seema Verma, has suggested it will accept more recommendations than it did in the past from a committee of doctors formed by the American Medical Association on how much Medicare should pay for services and procedures — essentially letting doctors set their own pay.",3.5,1,[3.5]
1614,3360,11,12,2017,2017-11-12,Vox,"Trump: I believe Putin on election meddling. Intel leaders: You’re getting “played.""","On Saturday, President Donald Trump called former CIA Director John Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper “political hacks” for disagreeing with his friendly stance toward Russia.  They both hit back on Sunday — claiming the president is getting “played” by Russian President Vladimir Putin.  “By not confronting the issue directly and not acknowledging to Putin that we know you’re responsible for this, I think he’s giving Putin a pass,” Brennan said on CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday morning. “I think it demonstrates to Mr. Putin that Donald Trump can be played by foreign leaders who are going to appeal to his ego and try to play upon his insecurities, which is very, very worrisome from a national security standpoint.”  Clapper piled on: “He seems very susceptible to rolling out the red carpet and honor guards and all the trappings and pomp and circumstance that come with the office, and I think that appeals to him, and I think it plays to his insecurities.”  Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, who came on the show minutes after Brennan and Clapper, then pushed back. “Those were the most ridiculous statements,” he said. “President Trump is not getting played by anybody.”  Brennan and Clapper, who both served in the Obama administration, were referring to Trump’s comments on Saturday where he said he believed Putin’s claim that Russia didn’t meddle in the 2016 presidential election. “He said he didn't meddle, he said he didn't meddle. I asked him again. You can only ask so many times,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One. “Every time he sees me he says, ‘I didn't do that,’ and I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it.”  That wasn’t the first time Trump accepted Putin’s account about election interference. On July 7, the two men had a one-on-one meeting at the G20, a gathering of the world’s top 20 economies. There, Putin also denied Russia’s efforts to interfere in the election, and Trump reportedly took it at face value.  The problem is, in January, the FBI, CIA, and NSA clearly assessed that Russia did interfere in the election — and that Putin was behind it. After Trump’s comments, the CIA said its director, Mike Pompeo — who is close to Trump — stood by the January assessment, something a CIA spokesperson told me last week.  But on Sunday, after a pugnacious tweetstorm and before the Brennan-Clapper appearance, Trump sort of walked back his comments. ""I believe that he feels that he and Russia did not meddle in the election,"" Trump said during a news conference in Vietnam, referring to Putin. ""As to whether I believe it or not, I am with our agencies, especially as currently constituted with the leadership.""  “I don’t know why the ambiguity about this”  On CNN, Brennan said he wasn’t sure why Trump is waffling on Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.  “I don’t know why the ambiguity about this,” Brennan said. “Putin is committed to undermining our system, our democracy, and our whole process. And to try paint it in any other way is, I think, astounding and, in fact, poses a peril to this country.”  Clapper agreed: “It’s very clear that the Russians interfered in the election, and it’s still puzzling as to why Mr. Trump does not acknowledge that and embrace it and also push hard against Mr. Putin.”  Part of the answer could be that Trump is easily flattered by foreign leaders if they praise him, as Clapper noted. Putin has said some marginally nice things about Trump, and he makes time to meet with Trump whenever possible.  But Trump’s continued willingness to build closer ties with Russia — especially as special counsel Robert Mueller investigates any possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow during the election — is peculiar at best.  It’s also clearly worrying some former top senior intelligence officials — and that’s no small thing.  You can watch the full interview with Brennan and Clapper here:",4.75,2,"[5.0, 4.5]"

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2017  This came less than 24 hours after Trump asserted that he “believed” Russian President Vladimir Putin’s claim that Moscow didn’t interfere in the election, even though US intelligence agencies say Putin was behind it all.  Later on Sunday, Trump attacked former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama for failing to establish good relations with Russia when they were in power.  Finally, at 7:48 am Hanoi time, Trump lobbed a sarcastic putdown at North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, calling him “short and fat.”  Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me ""old,"" when I would NEVER call him ""short and fat?"" Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2017  The tweets threaten to derail attention from the administration’s main messaging during the trip. And if you missed any of it because you were honoring Veterans Day, no worries. We’ve got you covered.  Trump got into a name-calling spat with Kim Jong Un  The war of words between Kim and Trump continues.  This particular spat began on Tuesday, when Trump gave a speech to South Korea’s National Assembly during his Asia trip. There, he gave a stark warning to North Korea: “Do not underestimate us, and do not try us.” And on November 11, North Korea’s Foreign Ministry responded: “The reckless remarks by a dotard like Trump can never frighten us or put a stop to our advance.”  “Dotard” is how the Korean Central News Agency — North Korea’s state-run media organization — translates the Korean word for “old lunatic.” And it’s the second time North Korea has used this. The first time was in September, when Kim himself said, “I will surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged US dotard with fire.”  So Trump took to Twitter to hit back: “Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me ‘old,’ when I would NEVER call him ‘short and fat? Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen!”  Two notable things are going on here. First, in his tweet 30 minutes earlier, Trump expressed wanting better relations with North Korea; it’s hard to see how insulting the country’s leader accomplishes that. And second, Trump is saying he wants to befriend Kim, something he later confirmed at a joint news conference with Vietnamese President Tran Dai Quang.  “I believe it's possible. Strange things happen in life,” Trump said. “If it did happen, it would be a good thing for North Korea, and a good thing for lots of other places and good for the world. Certainly it's something that could happen. I don't know if it will, but it would be very, very nice if it did.”  Some experts think Trump’s North Korea tweet was a good idea to possibly improve relations. “It's unorthodox to be sure,” Matthew Kroenig, a nuclear expert at the Atlantic Council, told me, “but the US strategy of ‘maximum pressure and engagement’ requires the credible promise of a future thaw in relations. That is something that Trump may be better able to offer than a more conventional politician.”  Others think the “short and fat” insult did more damage than the suggestion of friendship can repair. “The North Koreans — and of course Kim Jong Un — will look at that as a personal attack,” Harry Kazianis, an Asia expert at the Center for the National Interest, said in an interview. “They won't exactly take kindly to it. Trump needs to understand that going toe to toe with Kim will gain America nothing and only legitimize North Korea. He needs to stop. Period.”  Trump wants “a good relationship with Russia”  When will all the haters and fools out there realize that having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. There always playing politics - bad for our country. I want to solve North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, terrorism, and Russia can greatly help! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2017  Trump has made no secret of his desire to improve US-Russia relations. Now he says those who don’t agree with him are “playing politics.”  Yet Russia provides support to North Korea, works to keep Syria’s Bashar al-Assad in power, invaded Ukraine in 2014, and already has a history of working with the US and its allies to counter terrorism. And of course, special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating potential collusion between Trump and Russia during the presidential campaign.  But Trump’s Sunday tweet seems even odder still given what happened hours earlier. During an international summit in Vietnam where Putin and Trump met, the Russian leader denied that Moscow interfered in the 2016 presidential election — and Trump bought it.  “He said he didn't meddle, he said he didn't meddle. I asked him again. You can only ask so many times,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Saturday. “Every time he sees me he says I didn't do that and I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it.”  That conflicts with what the US intelligence community said in January, where the FBI, CIA, and NSA assessed that Russia did interfere in the election — and that Putin was behind it. Soon after Trump’s comments, the CIA said its director, Mike Pompeo — who has in the past distorted intelligence to help Trump — stood by that assessment.  On Sunday, and after his tweet, Trump somewhat backtracked his comments. ""I believe that he feels that he and Russia did not meddle in the election,"" Trump said during a news conference in Vietnam, referring to Putin. ""As to whether I believe it or not, I am with our agencies, especially as currently constituted with the leadership.""  It’s unclear how Trump’s semi-about-face will affect his Russia policy going forward. But for now he wants to remind people that two previous leaders have a complicated past with Russia too.  Trump attacks Clinton and Obama  Another bizarre Sunday tweet was an attempt to castigate Clinton and Obama for not improving US-Russia ties.  Does the Fake News Media remember when Crooked Hillary Clinton, as Secretary of State, was begging Russia to be our friend with the misspelled reset button? Obama tried also, but he had zero chemistry with Putin. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2017  Regarding Clinton, Trump is referring to an infamous meeting on March 6, 2009, where Clinton, then the US secretary of state, presented Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov with a mock “reset” button. The problem was there was a big typo — and the US got the Russian word for “reset” wrong. It’s worth reading the immensely awkward Clinton-Lavrov exchange about the mistake, as reported by the Washington Post:  ""We worked hard to get the right Russian word,"" Clinton said. ""Do you think we got it?"" Lavrov, who never misses an opportunity for a diplomatic jab, bluntly said, ""You got it wrong."" The word, he pointed out, was two letters off — it should have been ""Perezagruzka."" What was there, he added, actually means ""overcharge."" Clinton burst out in laughter and declared, ""We won't let you do that to us.""  And as for Obama, he and Putin famously had a frosty relationship. During Obama’s presidency, Putin invaded Ukraine and supported Assad as he killed thousands of his people with chemical weapons. Conflict was slightly possible: Obama signaled he might strike Syria in September 2013 until he asked Congress to authorize the strike. Eventually, the US and Russia agreed on a deal to destroy Syria’s chemical weapons, ending the strike threat.  The difference, though, is that Russia opposed many of Obama’s plans when he was in office and didn’t help Clinton win an election. With Trump, in fact, it’s the opposite: US intelligence agencies assess Russia’s goal was to help put Trump in the White House. Here’s a relevant passage from the January intelligence assessment:  We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election. Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.  Trump’s tweet about Clinton and Obama’s relationships with Russia ignores all of this context — and yet again suggests he wants to cozy up to Moscow.",4.75,2,"[4.5, 5.0]"

BONN, Germany — When President Trump announced in June that the United States would withdraw from the Paris agreement, America officially ceded its global leadership on climate change.  The retreat had actually begun months earlier, when climate change disappeared from most government websites and vanished from America’s domestic and international agendas. No longer would the United States federal government address climate change at home or raise global warming with ministers and heads of state, as former President Barack Obama and his cabinet routinely did.  It was a dramatic shift, and it was meant to be.  “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,” Mr. Trump said in repudiating the accord. “The Paris climate accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries.”",4.5,1,[4.5]

The problem is that the press and the anti-Moore politicians have crucified Moore…We thought you were innocent until proven guilty!  Another key fact: The claim is a 40 year old claim brought to light by a woman who has ties to the DNC…So many things about this claim just don’t pass the smell test. Breitbart News has yet another item that doesn’t help the accuser’s case:  Trending: AMERICA’S BIGGEST LOSER Explains Why Multiple Sexual Assault Claims Against Bill Clinton Are Not As Serious As Kavanaugh’s…Calls For CIVIL WAR! [VIDEO]  MOTHER MAKES BIG MISTAKE:  The mother of Leigh Corfman, who says that Alabama Senatorial Candidate Roy Moore tried to engage in a sexual encounter with her when she was 14, has contradicted a key detail of Corfman’s story.  Speaking by phone to Breitbart News on Saturday, Corfman’s mother, Nancy Wells, 71, says that her daughter did not have a phone in her bedroom during the period that Moore is reported to have allegedly called Corfman – purportedly on Confman’s bedroom phone – to arrange at least one encounter.    Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court? Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?  Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court? * Yes, he will be confirmed. No, he will not be confirmed.  Email *  Phone      Moore strongly denies Corfman’s claims.  The Washington Post, which first published its newsmaking, on-the-record interview with Corfman last week, cited Corfman as remembering that she provided Moore with her number when she was 14. She said that she spoke to Moore from what she described as the phone in her bedroom.  Citing Corfman, the Post reported:  After her mother went into the courtroom, Corfman says, Moore asked her where she went to school, what she liked to do and whether he could call her sometime. She remembers giving him her number and says he called not long after. She says she talked to Moore on her phone in her bedroom, and they made plans for him to pick her up at Alcott Road and Riley Street, around the corner from her house.  Soon after, Corfman said, he called again, and picked her up again at the same spot.  Later on, Corfman described a third phone call:  She says that after their last encounter, Moore called again, but that she found an excuse to avoid seeing him. She says that at some point during or soon after her meetings with Moore, she told two friends in vague terms that she was seeing an older man.  Corfman clearly claimed she spoke to Moore on what she said was “her phone in her bedroom” on at least one of those occasions. The Post did not specify whether the second or third alleged calls purportedly took place on a bedroom phone.  Wells, Corfman’s mother, was asked by Breitbart News: “Back then did she have her own phone in her room or something?”  “No,” she replied matter-of-factly. “But the phone in the house could get through to her easily.”  HOW COULD HE BE GUILTY?  The Post story relies heavily on Corfman’s memory and her ability to recount events consistently.  The newspaper reported that “Corfman described her story consistently in six interviews with The Post.”  The Post story uses the word “remembers” 10 times when quoting or paraphrasing Corfman.  Here are those 10 times:  1: The Post cited Corfman thusly: “’I wanted it over with — I wanted out,’ she remembers thinking.”  This detail related to Corfman’s claim that Moore drove her to his house, removed his own clothes besides his underwear, took off her shirt and guided her hand to his underwear.  2: During the initial alleged encounter, when Corfman said that Moore was watching her while Corfman’s mother went into the courtroom, the Post reported, “She remembers giving him her number and says he called not long after.”  3: “I remember the further I got from my house, the more nervous I got,” Corfman was quoted as saying when she recalled the alleged drive with Moore from her house.  5 – 7: The Post used the word three times when citing Corfman in the following paragraph:  She remembers an unpaved driveway. She remembers going inside and him giving her alcohol on this visit or the next, and that at some point she told him she was 14. She says they sat and talked. She remembers that Moore told her she was pretty, put his arm around her and kissed her, and that she began to feel nervous and asked him to take her home, which she says he did.  8 – Referring to the alleged sexual encounter, the Post reported:  She remembers that Moore kissed her, that he took off her pants and shirt, and that he touched her through her bra and underpants. She says that he guided her hand to his underwear and that she yanked her hand back.  9 – In that same encounter, the Post relates:  She remembers thinking, “I don’t want to do this” and “I need to get out of here.” She says that she got dressed and asked Moore to take her home, and that he did.  Meanwhile, Wells told Breitbart that she and her daughter stick by the Post’s story. “It’s truthful and it was researched very well,” she said.  Asked if she could remember Moore, then a 32-year-old assistant district attorney, allegedly asking to watch her daughter in 1971 while Wells went into a courtroom, Wells recounted the story essentially the same way she told it to the Post.  Wells told this reporter: “We were sitting in the hall. He came up and started talking to us. We were sitting on a bench waiting to go into court. He said, you know, ‘What are you doing.’ You know, we told him. He is Roy Moore. And he said, ‘You don’t want her to go in there and hear all of the bickering.’ And I said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘I will be glad to stay out here with her and bring her in if she needs to come in.’ And so that is the way it started.”  “Probably if it were in today’s times that never would have happened,” Wells added. “He sounded like someone that I could trust and we were there in the courthouse.”  Corfman described her own troubled background to the Post, including three divorces, bankruptcies and a history of drug abuse.  The Post related:  She says that her teenage life became increasingly reckless with drinking, drugs, boyfriends, and a suicide attempt when she was 16.  As the years went on, Corfman says, she did not share her story about Moore partly because of the trouble in her life. She has had three divorces and financial problems. While living in Arizona, she and her second husband started a screen-printing business that fell into debt. They filed for bankruptcy protection three times, once in 1991 with $139,689 in unpaid claims brought by the Internal Revenue Service and other creditors, according to court records.  Moore strongly denied Corfman’s claims. “These allegations are completely false and are a desperate political attack by the National Democrat Party and the Washington Post on this campaign,” Moore said in immediate response to the Post’s story.  Moore’s campaign said in a statement, “This garbage is the very definition of fake news and intentional defamation.”  The campaign pointed out that Moore has been married to his wife, Kayla, for nearly 33 years and has four children and five grandchildren. It also noted that Moore has served in public office in the past and that no such allegations were previously made.  The statement said:  The Judge has been a candidate in four hotly-contested statewide political contests, twice as a gubernatorial candidate and twice as a candidate for chief justice. He has been a three-time candidate for local office, and he has been a national figure in two ground-breaking, judicial fights over religious liberty and traditional marriage.  “After over 40 years of public service, if any of these allegations were true, they surely would have been made public long before now,” the statement continued.  On Saturday, Moore further addressed the allegations:  “Now I want to address something that some people have come here to hear about,” Moore said at a local campaign event. “Shortly after becoming the Republican nominee for the United States Senate, the Washington Post began an attack on the Foundation for Moral Law, on my wife, and on me. For weeks, we read about my salary which they distorted, about taxes where they said we were paid money we never got. But we endured that.”  “Later, they came out and endorsed my opponent in this race,” he continued. “Just two days ago, the Washington Post published yet another attack on my character and reputation in a desperate attempt to stop my political campaign for the United States Senate. These attacks about a minor are completely false and untrue about something that happened nearly 40 years ago. But more than being completely false and untrue, they are very hurtful to me personally.”  “I wanted to make it clear to the media present and the people present, I have not provided alcoholic beverages—beer or anything else—to a minor. I have not been guilty of sexual misconduct with anyone,” he declared. “These allegations came only four and a half weeks before the general election on Dec. 12. Why now?”  “For forty years I have been closely scrutinized in the press and the public media. I have had investigations by the attorney general, I’ve had investigations by the judicial inquiry commission on more than one occasion, I’ve had investigations by the court of the judiciary, I’ve been in five statewide campaigns in which they do opposition research—they do investigations, as you can see in every one I’ve ever run—and three county elections and two major controversies over religious liberty and the Ten Commandments and same-sex marriage,” he continued. “I’ve been investigated more than any other person in this country. That grown women would wait forty years to come right before an election to bring charges is absolutely unbelievable.”",3.5,2,"[4.5, 2.5]"

But he says, ‘I didn’t do that.’ I think he’s very insulted by it, if you want to know the truth.”  Trump went on to call the fact that Russia interfered in our election an “artificial Democratic hit job” that would cause people to die in Syria because Putin’s hurt feelings about being called on his crimes would prevent him from making a deal to end the bloody conflict in that country.

1621,3374,11,12,2017,2017-11-12,The New York Times,Republicans Search for Proof Their Tax Plans Will Pay for Themselves,"The Treasury Department has not yet released any economic analysis of the congressional plans. Economists at Goldman Sachs said last month that they expect tax cuts to generate enough additional growth to offset about a fifth of their revenue losses. That means $1 trillion of net tax cuts would lose $800 billion on a dynamic basis.  Dynamic scoring is inexact in the best of circumstances. Under the compressed congressional schedule this fall, it is even more difficult, said Alan J. Auerbach, a University of California, Berkeley, economist who is widely considered a godfather of modern dynamic scoring models.  As a result, only a few models have churned out consistent dynamic analyses that attempt to account for all the provisions of the House and Senate bills. The Tax Foundation has one. Mr. Smetters and his Penn Wharton team have another. Perhaps the most important scorekeeper on that front, the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, is due to weigh in this week, with an analysis of the bill pending in the House.  Ironically, the models that so far have produced the least optimistic forecasts for the Republican plan are the ones that most closely track the assumptions conservatives have long espoused about the economy: that racking up deficits and debt will hold back growth.  That is the case with the Penn Wharton model, which finds that the House bill would lose between $1 trillion and $1.7 trillion over a decade in revenue, after accounting for growth, depending on various assumptions about the flow of investment dollars in the global economy and the growth-stoking power of tax cuts. The Tax Foundation’s more optimistic model projects the Senate bill would lose $500 billion in revenue after growth effects.  Other economists have produced optimistic effects based on approximations of a bill Congress might eventually agree upon. On Friday, Douglas Holtz-Eakin and Gordon Gray of the conservative American Action Forum released an analysis that attempts to mirror the joint committee’s methodology, but that models a bill with smaller net tax cuts than in the Republican plans. It found such a plan could cost as little as $310 billion over a decade.  The one model so far to suggest that the bills could fully pay for themselves comes from a Boston University economist, Laurence J. Kotlikoff, who employs what he calls a more comprehensive view of the global economy’s dynamics than other economists do. Mr. Kotlikoff’s analysis finds large growth effects from the House and Senate’s plans to cut top corporate tax rates to 20 percent from 35 percent today. It makes some growth-boosting assumptions that differ from the bills as drafted, and it essentially excludes the impacts of personal income tax changes on the economy; other models find those changes would affect growth and revenue.",5.0,1,[5.0]

1625,3382,11,12,2017,2017-11-12,Associated Press News,Rural areas at risk as water levels drop in massive aquifer," The draining of a massive aquifer that underlies portions of eight states in the central U.S. is drying up streams, causing fish to disappear and threatening the livelihood of farmers who rely on it for their crops.  Water levels in the Ogallala aquifer have been dropping for decades as irrigators pump water faster than rainfall can recharge it.  An analysis of federal data found the Ogallala aquifer shrank twice as fast over the past six years compared with the previous 60, The Denver Post reports.  The drawdown has become so severe that streams are drying at a rate of 6 miles per year and some highly resilient fish are disappearing. In rural areas, farmers and ranchers worry they will no longer have enough water for their livestock and crops as the aquifer is depleted.  The aquifer lost 10.7 million acre-feet of storage between 2013 and 2015, the U.S. Geological Survey said in a June report.  “Now I never know, from one minute to the next, when I turn on a faucet or hydrant, whether there will be water or not,” said Lois Scott, 75, who lives west of Cope, Colorado, north of the frequently bone-dry bed of the Arikaree River.  A 40-foot well her grandfather dug by hand in 1914 gave water until recently, she said, lamenting the loss of lawns where children once frolicked and green pastures for cows. Scott’s now considering a move to Brush, Colorado, and leaving her family’s historic homestead farm.  “This will truly become the Great American Desert,” she said.  Also known as the High Plains Aquifer, the Ogallala underlies 175,000 square miles (453,000 square kilometers), including parts of Colorado, Wyoming Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Texas. That’s one of the primary agricultural regions of the U.S., producing $35 billion in crops annually.  Farmers and ranchers have been tapping into the aquifer since the 1930s to boost production and help them get by in times of drought.  However, overpumping has dried up 358 miles of surface rivers and streams across a 200-square-mile area covering eastern Colorado, western Kansas and Nebraska, according to researchers from Colorado State University and Kansas State University.  If farmers keep pumping water at the current pace, another 177 miles of rivers and streams will be lost before 2060, the researchers determined.  “We have almost completely changed the species of fish that can survive in those streams, compared with what was there historically. This is really a catastrophic change,” said Kansas State University conservation biologist Keith Gido, one of the authors of a report on the aquifer published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  If all pumping stopped immediately, it would still take hundreds of years for rain-fed streams and rivers to recharge the aquifer, Gido said.  ___  Information from: The Denver Post, http://www.denverpost.com",4.5,1,[4.5]
1596,3305,11,12,2017,2017-11-12,Associated Press News,Drawing Mary and Joseph into Moore controversy raises ire," In this Monday, Sept. 25, 2017, file photo, former Alabama Chief Justice and U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore speaks at a rally, in Fairhope, Ala. According to a Washington Post story Nov. 9, an Alabama woman said Moore made inappropriate advances and had sexual contact with her when she was 14. (AP Photo/Brynn Anderson, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — An Alabama state official is citing the Bible to defend the Republican U.S. Senate candidate accused of sexual advances on girls. State auditor Jim Ziegler says “Mary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter,” suggesting that Roy Moore acted in a divine tradition if he in fact made sexual advances toward a 14-year-old girl.  Theologians and pastors, among others, expressed revulsion that Mary and Joseph would be used to counter allegations of sexual misbehavior with a minor. They also said Ziegler got the facts wrong and ignored the cultural context of the time in which Jesus lived.  “If this is evangelicalism, I’m on the wrong team,” the evangelical commentator Ed Stetzer wrote in Christianity Today. “But it is not. Christians don’t use Joseph and Mary to explain child molesting accusations.”  Moore, a 70-year-old former state Supreme Court justice, flatly denied allegations of decades-old sexual advances on girls, published Thursday in a Washington Post story. The accounts by multiple women prompted Republican lawmakers to say he should end his candidacy for the Dec. 12 special election if the allegations are true. “I have never engaged in sexual misconduct,” Moore said Friday.  But Ziegler was dismissive about the fuss. “There’s just nothing immoral or illegal here,” he told the Washington Examiner. “Maybe just a little bit unusual.”  Rev. Jim Martin, editor at large of the Jesuit magazine America, tweeted Friday that “comparing the allegations against Roy Moore in any way to Joseph and Mary is disgusting.” Martin said: “We have no idea about the exact ages of either the Virgin Mary or St. Joseph at the time of their betrothal or marriage.”  The Bible does not state the ages of Joseph and Mary, agrees Margaret M. Mitchell, a professor of early Christian literature and the New Testament at the University of Chicago Divinity School.  Under ancient norms and apparently under first century Roman and Jewish law, she said, it was apparently common for girls 12 and older to be betrothed, though practice varied by region, social class and more.  She said the earliest text to mention Mary’s age is “The Infancy Gospel of James,” which she describes as “a clearly legendary text that is trying to expand on the gospel accounts.” That non-authoritative text placed Mary’s age at 12 when she conceived and it cited supposed evidence of her enduring virginity to demonstrate she conceived Jesus without sexual intercourse.  Similarly, Mitchell said by email, “We have no idea how old the historical Joseph was, though a tradition that he was very old developed in the second century and beyond.” The point of that, too, was to support the idea of the virgin birth — Joseph perhaps being too old to impregnate Mary.  Such theories were “fanciful expansions on the Gospel narratives,” Mitchell said. But they add a “veneer of solemnity ... that may allow a modern Christian like Mr Z (Ziegler) to gloss over what it means for a 12 or 14 year old girl to be viewed as and used as a sexual vessel.”  Martin, in tweets, said: “Joseph is often depicted in art as older than Mary, in fact, considerably older, so as to make him seem less ‘sexualized,’ and to emphasize Mary’s virginity. But, in fact, both Mary and Joseph could have been the same age.”  Leigh Corfman told the Post she was 14 when Moore first approached her and took her to his home twice, the second time touching her over her bra and panties and having her touch him over his underwear. The Post quoted three other women who said he pursued them when they were 16 to 18 and he was in his early 30s. He denies the women’s reports and says he won’t quit the race.  If the Bible is not clear on the subject, the law is: Alabama’s legal age of consent then and now is 16 and adults cannot touch children sexually or entice them into a home for that purpose.  ___  AP Religion Writer Rachel Zoll contributed to this report.",2.75,2,"[0.5, 5.0]"
1602,3320,11,11,2017,2017-11-11,Vox,Kushner to CNN: fire 20% of your staff,"President Donald Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner is still upset with CNN.  As the Wall Street Journal reported last night, Kushner met earlier this year with Gary Ginsberg, a top executive at Time Warner, CNN’s parent company. In the meeting, Kushner told Ginsberg CNN should fire 20 percent of its staff because of its coverage of the 2016 presidential election.  A White House official told the Wall Street Journal that Kushner’s remark wasn’t serious, and that he “was simply trying to make a point.” The White House didn’t immediately return Vox’s request for comment about the meeting.  It seems like the Trump administration’s feud with CNN isn’t going away. When Kushner took more control of his father-in-law’s presidential campaign last summer, he started complaining to CNN executives about its Trump coverage. He was particularly angry after CNN fact-checked a speech Trump gave on June 22 and threatened to keep campaign members from appearing on the network.  Since then, Trump’s anger toward CNN has only grown. Trump continues to label the media organization as “fake news,” and he famously tweeted a doctored video of him wrestling a CNN avatar. In August, he shared — and then deleted — a cartoon picture of a “Trump Train” running over a person meant to represent CNN.  That the White House is openly attacking CNN — and the wider media — is already troubling. But Trumpworld’s antagonism toward CNN may actually lead the administration to deny a pending media merger that involves the network.  Trump may block a big deal because he hates CNN  On October 22, 2016, AT&T announced its intention to acquire Time Warner — a media company that houses premium TV channel HBO, film studio Warner Bros., and networks like CNN — for $85.4 billion.  Because the merger is so large, the government must review it for antitrust reasons. But Trump already said he wouldn’t sign off on the merger last year. ""As an example of the power structure I'm fighting, AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,"" Trump said. And on Wednesday, news broke that the administration was looking to block the deal.  It’s unclear whether the administration wants to stop the merger because of its animus toward CNN or because Trump promised a populist presidency that would be an antitrust enforcer. The Wall Street Journal notes that the administration claims politics aren’t factoring in to the government’s review of the merger, and AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said Thursday he doesn’t believe politics is an issue.  But as my colleague Matthew Yglesias wrote on Wednesday, it’s hard to know with Trump:  We have a president who lies constantly, who disregards the norms of American government, who’s openly disdainful of the social function of a free press, and who’s set up his administration in a way that seems to generally sideline expertise while opening the door to massive financial conflicts of interest. Under those circumstances, any actions he takes naturally fall under a pall of suspicion, and it’s easy for companies who are adversely impacted by his administration’s regulatory decisions to raise questions about them.  So even if Kushner’s remark was just a joke, it’s no laughing matter.",4.5,1,[4.5]
1595,3303,11,11,2017,2017-11-11,Associated Press News,Will Alabama pick a Democrat over Moore? Suburbs will decide,"Former Alabama Chief Justice and U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore speaks at the Vestavia Hills Public library, Saturday, Nov. 11, 2017, in Birmingham, Ala. According to a Thursday, Nov. 9 Washington Post story an Alabama woman said Moore made inappropriate advances and had sexual contact with her when she was 14. Moore has denied the allegations. (AP Photo/Brynn Anderson)  ALABASTER, Ala. (AP) — It’s no secret that if Roy Moore is going to lose his race for U.S. Senate, it’s going to happen in Alabama’s suburbs. And on Friday, a day after allegations emerged that the outspoken Christian conservative had sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl decades ago, at least a few Republicans in one Birmingham suburb were having second thoughts about their party’s nominee.  “Really and truly, I cannot tell you what I’m going to do right now,” said Carolyn Griffin, of Calera, as she watched her dog Loxy exercise at Alabaster’s Veterans Park.  Griffin is the kind of voter who might be moved by the allegations, and suburban Shelby County is where other likeminded voters are located. While Alabama might be called the Heart of Dixie, much of Shelby County is Anysuburb USA, with subdivisions and strip malls sprawling ever farther south along traffic-choked highways leading out of Birmingham.  The accusations against Moore come as Democrats are feeling increasingly optimistic about their strength in suburbs after Tuesday’s elections in Virginia, New Jersey and other races. Still, it’s a steep, steep climb in Alabama. No Democrat has held a U.S. Senate seat there since 1997, when Howell Heflin retired.  Moore has been considered the strong favorite as a Republican running in a deeply red state, and polls taken before the Washington Post story showed him with a lead over Democratic challenger Doug Jones in the Dec. 12 race.  But Moore, a polarizing figure within his own state, has typically underperformed other Republicans in general-election races, giving rise to Democrats’ hope of a victory against him in the off-year election.  “There was a universe in Alabama that was uncomfortable with him, all while Republicans were gaining in Alabama,” Birmingham-based Democratic pollster John Anzalone said. “These allegations now give these voters a reason to vote against him or stay home.”  The 70-year-old Moore, a former state Supreme Court judge, was twice removed from the Alabama Supreme Court, once for disobeying a federal court order to remove a 5,200-pound (2,359-kilogram) granite Ten Commandments monument from the lobby of the state judicial building and later for urging state probate judges to defy the U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized gay marriage.  He has vehemently denied accusations that he had sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl and pursued three other teenagers when he was an assistant district attorney in his early 30s.  He repeated his denial Saturday while speaking to the Mid Alabama Republican Club in Vestavia Hills outside Birmingham.  “There are investigations going on. In the next few days, there will be revelations about the motivations and the content of this article that will be brought to the public,” Moore said without elaborating. “We fully expect the people of Alabama to see through this charade.”  David Mowery, an Alabama-based political campaign consultant who helped run a Democrat’s unsuccessful campaign against Moore in 2012, said the allegations against Moore are damaging but aren’t necessarily a death blow.  “I think it hurts. It hurts because they are having to divert time and effort and probably money into killing it,” Mowery said. “Can they turn the page, so to speak, and turn it back to a D versus R thing?”  “There’s an old saying that the only way some candidates could lose is to be caught with a dead girl or a live boy. Alabama is going to test the specs on that like ‘Hold my beer,’” Mowery said.  The state’s eight most populous counties have almost as many people as the other 59 combined, and those are among the areas where Moore was weakest in the primary against Sen. Luther Strange, appointed to the Senate on an interim basis after Jeff Sessions was elevated to U.S. attorney general.  Former state Republican Party chairman Marty Connors said he expected the impact of the allegations to be concentrated in the suburbs.  “It will affect what I call your really, really moderate Republican voters,” Connors said.  But not everyone in the suburbs is ready to abandon Moore. Frank Pimintel of Alabaster said he viewed the allegations as part of a typical political smear campaign and wouldn’t judge Moore for something that happened more than 30 years ago.  “I’m about states’ rights, low taxes, local control. He stands for a lot of things that I believe in,” Pimintel said.  That’s more along the lines of the reaction that Connors and retired University of Alabama political science professor Bill Stewart expect rural voters to have.  “In rural Alabama, they don’t seem to be putting a lot of stock in this story,” Stewart said. “They don’t believe it.”  Connors said the accusations could even energize supporters, similar to how President Donald Trump survived audio of him bragging about groping women.  Mark Victory of Alabaster counted himself as still “tentatively in the Moore camp” after the claims.  Victory said he wants to support Trump’s agenda but might be swayed by more proof. If there is more proof, he said, his reaction would be to not vote at all.  “I’m not going to vote for his opponent,” Victory said, saying he believes Jones is too submissive to the agenda of national Democratic leaders.  But moderate Republicans not voting might not be enough for Jones, Stewart said, “given the intensity of Republican identification in Alabama.” Stewart still thinks Moore’s going to win, despite the allegations.  “I don’t think it matters enough to make Jones the favorite to win,” he said.  ___  Beaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.

(AP Photo/Hau Dinh)  DANANG, Vietnam (AP) — An annual Pacific Rim summit is sticking with its tradition of promoting free trade and closer regional ties, shrugging off President Donald Trump’s “America First” approach.  The leaders of the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum said Saturday that they had recommitted to fighting protectionism and “all unfair trade practices.” They also expressed support for multi-country institutions and regional as well as country-to-country trade agreements.  Trade ministers from 11 of the Pacific Rim countries announced an agreement on pushing ahead with a free-trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, whose destiny had been cast into doubt after Trump pulled the U.S. out.  Efforts to get an agreement on how to proceed without the U.S. stumbled at the last moment, with leaders unable to formally endorse the proposal. But trade ministers announced a preliminary deal, with some details to be worked out later.  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters that environmental protection, labor rights, gender issues and the auto industry were areas needing work, though he did not go into specifics.  “We got a lot of work done, but there is still more work to do,” Trudeau said.  The revisions required for the 11 remaining TPP countries to continue talks required a difficult balance between high standards and pragmatism, said Japanese Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi.  “The substance is something all the TPP countries can agree on,” said Motegi. “This will send a very strong message to the U.S. and the other countries in the region.”  Trudeau said his unexpected absence from a TPP leaders’ meeting on Friday, which caused consternation among his fellow leaders and confusion about Canada’s stance, stemmed from an extra-long meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.  “We were not ready to close the TPP 11 yesterday,” he said.  The ministers dropped some key provisions the Americans had required on protection of intellectual property, among others. They also changed the trade accord’s name to the unwieldy Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, or CPTPP.  Those trade talks took place on the sidelines of APEC summitry: ceremonial arrivals in bright tailored shirts to a gala banquet, a closed-door retreat and scores of bilateral meetings between the 21 leaders attending the event in this coastal resort city.  Increasingly, APEC summits have become more of an opportunity for such side talks, and for host nations to showcase their growing affluence.  Trump’s dramatically different stances from his predecessor, Barack Obama — such as his “America First” trade strategy and his skepticism over climate change — were apparent in Danang. But his hosts and the other leaders took it in stride.  As an institution, apart from its pageantry and its tradition of drawing leaders together for face-to-face meetings, APEC mainly serves as a laboratory for trying out policies and encouraging “best practices,” said Alan Bollard, executive director for APEC’s secretariat. Unlike the TPP trade pact, whose decisions will eventually be enforced, APEC’s statements are nonbinding.  “We’re in an easier place to try things out, to test policy sensitivities even if we don’t get everybody around the table,” Bollard said.  The declaration issued Saturday contain calls for continued work to improve food security, to help ensure the benefits of economic growth are more evenly shared and to make member countries more business-friendly, among a slew of development-related plans. It also contained measures addressing climate change.  As a developing country with a fast-growing export sector, this year’s host country, Vietnam, has a strong interest in open trade and access for its exports to consumers in the West given the role foreign investment and trade have played in helping its economy to grow at a more than 6 percent pace. Danang, Vietnam’s third-largest city, is in the midst of a construction boom as dozens of resorts and smaller hotels pop up along its scenic coastline.  APEC’s members are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, the U.S. and Vietnam.  The countries participating in the newly renamed Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.",3.5,1,[3.5]

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)  HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — President Donald Trump is exchanging school yard taunts with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.  In a response to North Korea calling Trump’s speech in South Korea “reckless remarks by an old lunatic,” Trump tweeted from Hanoi on Sunday morning: “Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me ‘old,’ when I would NEVER call him ‘short and fat?’”  Trump goes on to say sarcastically, “Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend — and maybe someday that will happen!”  Trump has been working to rally global pressure against North Korea’s nuclear weapons program on a trip to Asia. That includes a stern speech delivered in South Korea’s National Assembly on Tuesday, in which he said: “Do not underestimate us. And do not try us. ... The weapons you’re acquiring are not making you safer, they are putting your regime in grave danger. Every step you take down this dark path increases the peril you face.”  On Saturday, Kim’s government responded by accusing Trump of trying to demonize North Korea, keep it apart from the international community and undermine its government.  “Reckless remarks by an old lunatic like Trump will never scare us or stop our advance,” the North’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement. “On the contrary, all this makes us more sure that our choice to promote economic construction at the same time as building up our nuclear force is all the more righteous, and it pushes us to speed up the effort to complete our nuclear force.”  North Korea is not known to have tested any of its missiles or nuclear devices since Sept. 15, a relative lull after a brisk series of tests earlier this year.  Asked at news conference with Vietnam’s president later Sunday if he could become friends with the North Korean leader, Trump replied it “might be a strange thing to happen but it’s certainly a possibility.”  He said he doesn’t know if that friendship will develop, but added it would be “very, very nice if it did.”",4.0,1,[4.0]

Even those who remained interested after 10 or 15 minutes of painstaking back-and-forth often demurred when Mr. Carter asked them for payment information. “This one guy was outside in a wheelchair,” Mr. Carter said of a caller who couldn’t produce his credit card. “He didn’t want to go in and get it. I said, ‘I’m fine waiting,’ but I can’t push him.”  These setbacks only seem to make Mr. Carter focus more. At one point, he made a swiping motion between his face and his headset with his index finger and middle finger. “They recommend that you keep the microphone two fingers away,” he said. “I’m always doing that — checking that it’s two fingers. I’ll do that for the rest of my life.”  It seemed, all in all, like a grueling way to make the slightly more than $30,000 that Mr. Carter estimates he takes in before taxes. “The good thing is he can take hours off,” Lori told me. “But then he can lose his spot. It’s always a fight for the top.”  I was reminded of the Alec Baldwin monologue from the movie “Glengarry Glen Ross,” except that the prize for having the most sales wouldn’t be a Cadillac, it would be a set of steak knives, because the Liveops analytics team had calculated that agents would give nearly as much effort for a prize worth a small fraction of the cost.  Of course, unlike the salesmen in that movie, the Liveops agents can’t really be fired — the third prize — because they weren’t employees to begin with.  A while later, Mr. Carter described a recent initiative in which agents were promised a bonus if 95 percent of their collective sales were paid up front. “I knew it wasn’t going to work as soon as they said it,” he told me, because a handful of agents with low paid rates could ruin everyone else’s chances.  “They did do a pullover sweatshirt for the top two,” he added, brightening. “I was second, so that’s coming.”",1.5,1,[1.5]
1606,3339,11,11,2017,2017-11-11,Associated Press News,"US cities, states defy Trump, still back Paris climate deal","Demonstrators costumed as U.S. President Donald Trump and polar bears protest against the climate change during climate conference COP in Bonn, western Germany, Saturday, Nov. 11, 2017. (Bernd Thissen/dpa via AP)  BONN, Germany (AP) — A group of U.S. states, cities, businesses and universities said Saturday they are still committed to curbing global warming even as U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration is walking away from the Paris climate accord.  But the alliance, which has an economy larger than Japan and Germany combined, says it won’t be able to achieve the necessary cut in greenhouse gas emissions without some efforts at the federal level.  “It is important for the world to know, the American government may have pulled out of the Paris agreement, but the American people are committed to its goals, and there is nothing Washington can do to stop us,” former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg said at a global climate meeting in Bonn, Germany.  Gov. Jerry Brown of California echoed those comments.  “In the United States, we have a federal system, and states have real power as do cities. And when cities and states combine together, and then join with powerful corporations, that’s how we get stuff done,” he said.  His speech was briefly interrupted by anti-coal and anti-fracking protesters, who held up banners and shouted “We’re still in! Trump’s still out!”  The group calling itself “America’s Pledge” said states, cities and private groups have been taking considerable steps to reduce emissions by promoting renewable energy use and climate-friendly transportation systems.  “This is a pledge, and it’s a pledge that you can cash, because it’s real,” Brown said. “We are doing real stuff in California.”  In a report, however, the group said that “we cannot underscore strongly enough the critical nature of federal engagement to achieve the deep decarbonization goals the U.S. must undertake after 2025.”  Daniel Firger, one of the report’s contributors, said it was intended to show that many in the U.S. aren’t prepared to wait for Trump to change his mind on climate change again or wait for the next administration to tackle the issue.  “The good news around Trump’s announcement to withdraw is that it has galvanized a groundswell of bottom-up support from all corners of the U.S. economy,” Firger told The Associated Press.  Cities, regions and businesses in other nations around the world could look to the group for inspiration and support, he said, noting that the lessons learned by local authorities and businesses in the U.S. could be applied elsewhere.  Also Saturday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in her weekly podcast that every country needs to pitch in to keep global temperatures from rising.  Merkel also said it’s the responsibility of the industrial countries to develop environment-friendly technologies that are future-oriented, but “don’t lead to a loss of jobs.”  “We don’t gain anything if steel mills, aluminum plants and copper mills leave our countries and go somewhere else where environmental regulations are less strict — because then we haven’t made any gains for world climate,” she said.  ___  Jordans reported from Berlin.

Rumbling front loaders began scraping up the ash and rubble of nearly 9,000 destroyed homes and other structures in Northern California this week as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers launched a new phase of the largest wildfire clean-up in the state's history. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu)  SONOMA, Calif. (AP) — Rumbling bulldozers and front-loaders have started scraping up the ash, charred wood and crumbled bricks and concrete left from thousands of homes and buildings destroyed by blazes in California wine country, launching a new phase in the largest wildfire cleanup in state history.  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers contractors began the work this week in flattened, blackened blocks of Santa Rosa’s Coffey Park neighborhood. It experienced some of the most-sweeping destruction last month when fierce winds drove flames that killed at least 43 people and destroyed 8,900 houses and other buildings across Northern California.  On Santa Rosa streets where hundreds of houses once stood, “you look across the landscape and see nothing but burned everything,” Army Corps spokesman Rick Brown said as crews and heavy equipment around him began clearing debris from lots.  U.S., state and local agencies are working on the cleanup, which includes testing soil, air and water samples from burned areas for contamination. Authorities say they expect to have the lots cleared for property owners by early 2018, although rebuilding is expected to take years more.  California puts the insured losses at $3.3 billion so far, among the highest of any U.S. wildfires in recent decades.  Work is underway in California wine country to clear debris from areas ravaged by wildfires that tore through the area a month ago. The flames destroyed more than 8,000 homes in the region north of San Francisco. (Nov. 9)  In hard-hit Sonoma and Napa counties, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency finished the first phase of cleanup at most properties: removing potential hazardous substances before the heavy equipment moves in.  Generally, the fires overran housing developments and rural areas rather than industrial sites, so the hazardous waste is mainly what’s in garages and barns — propane tanks from barbecue grills, cans of motor oil, and pesticides, officials say.  That contrasts with Hurricane Harvey, which flooded more than a dozen Superfund sites in Houston and other coastal areas this year, raising fears that contamination may have reached a wide area. The damage is still being assessed.  In California, crews have started scraping up home foundations and the top 3 to 6 inches (75 to 150 millimeters) of ash, debris and soil, said Brown of the Army Corps of Engineers. In some of the more upscale developments on ridgetops, the work is complicated by ruins that have tumbled downhill, he said.  The Army Corps is taking soil samples near burned homes and buildings and will take more from the lots after they have been scraped, Brown said. The state will test the samples for contaminants such as asbestos or other metals and chemicals to ensure the sites are clean enough for rebuilding.  If not, “we’ll scrape a couple more inches of soil, take that back to the lab, and let them decide if that does it,” Brown said.  Some of those who lost homes have been confused over warnings of possible hazardous substances in the ruins of their neighborhoods. Watching the heavy equipment at work this week, survivor Larry Keyser admitted worrying over contamination but wasn’t sure what the cleanup crews would be testing for.  “Like any concerned citizen, you want to be concerned about your environment,” Keyser said.  Officials, meanwhile, have placed about a dozen air monitors around Sonoma County, including four at schools. The wildfires burned for more than a week and shrouded much of the San Francisco Bay Area in smoke, creating some of the worst air-quality readings on record there.  The air in the burned region is again testing at healthy levels, said Melanie Turner, spokeswoman at the California Air Resources Board.  Around the wildfire zones, teams from local water departments, the U.S. Geological Survey and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories also have been working to reduce and monitor any hazardous runoff into hundreds of waterways.  Teams have spent weeks positioning bundles of straw and bags of gravel or sand between blackened neighborhoods and creeks critical to people and native species, such as local coho salmon.  Devastated areas have received only light rain so far, but heavy downpours could sweep massive amounts of debris and contaminants into waterways.  With more showers at midweek, Rich Fadness at the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board readied a dozen staffers to grab samples of runoff flowing into creeks at four key sites.  “Any time there’s a fire, there’s always issues,” Fadness said. “With the amount of work we’re doing, I hope it will be minimized.”  ___  Associated Press photographer Jeff Chiu contributed to this story.",3.5,1,[3.5]

A stream of Republicans have recently announced plans to call it quits, including longtime Virginia Rep. Bob Goodlatte, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who said this week he would not run for re-election.  So far this cycle, 12 Republicans in the House and two in the Senate have announced plans to retire – and others are likely to follow suit. And these numbers do not include the 13 other Republicans who have left Congress to resign, take new positions in government or run for other offices.  REPUBLICAN RETIREMENTS  Sen.

Ted Poe, Texas  Rep. Bob Goodlatte, Virginia  The GOP retirements surpasses those of Democrats, who have seen just two retirements in the House and zero in the Senate so far this cycle. It also outpaces the number of retirements at this stage in past election cycles.  Democrats – who need to flip 24 seats to win back the House and three seats to win back the Senate – are arguing the recent GOP retirements improves their chances at flipping seats.  “In general, eliminating the power of incumbency creates a great deal of advantage for House Democratic challengers,” Ben Ray Luján, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, wrote in a memo this week.  REPUBLICANS WHO WON’T BE COMING BACK TO CONGRESS AFTER 2018 MIDTERM ELECTIONS  But Republicans point out the number of GOP lawmakers not running for re-election still falls below the historical average for retirements in an election cycle. They also say many of the retirees represent strong Republican districts.  “This is another pipedream from the same party that’s notorious for underperforming,” said Jesse Hunt, the National Republican Congressional Committee national press secretary. “We already have a host of quality Republican candidates declared in many of these seats and we’re confident they’ll remain in our column.”  Goodlatte’s announcement this week follows the retirements of other influential Republican lawmakers, including Texas Republican Rep. Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee; Texas Rep. Lamar Smith, chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology and Pennsylvania Rep. Charlie Dent.  Other Republicans have said the toxic political environment has contributed to their decision to leave Congress.  The two Republican senators who are retiring -- Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker and Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake – have both had high-profile spots with President Trump.  “People before politics has always been my philosophy and my motivation,"" New Jersey Rep. Frank A.

(Jorge Silva/Pool Photo via AP)  DANANG, Vietnam (AP) — Trade ministers from 11 Pacific Rim countries said they reached an agreement Saturday to proceed with the free-trade Trans-Pacific Partnership deal that was in doubt after President Donald Trump abandoned it. However, an immediate formal endorsement by the countries’ leaders meeting in Vietnam appeared unlikely.  A statement issued in the early hours Saturday said an accord was reached on “core elements” of the 11-member pact. The compromise was delayed by last-minute disagreements that prevented the TPP leaders from meeting to endorse a plan on Friday.  “Ministers are pleased to announce that they have agreed on the core elements of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership,” the 11 nations said in a statement.  A news conference was scheduled for later Saturday morning Vietnam time.  Japan’s delegate to the talks, Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi, told reporters that disagreements that cropped up Friday had been resolved in five hours of talks that stretched late into the night.  “We have confirmed there was no mistake about us having reached a basic agreement,” Motegi said.  Asked by reporters if the deal had the support of Canada, whose Prime Minister Justin Trudeau did not show up for the meeting planned for Friday, Motegi said “yes.”  “Canada did agree, and that means the ‘top’ also agreed,” he said. Japanese media reported that the Japanese and Vietnamese co-chairs of the ministerial meetings would hold a news conference Saturday on the sidelines of the summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which wraps up later Saturday.  Canada’s Minister for International Commerce Francois-P Champagne said in a tweet Saturday that “after lots of work, big progress on the ‘Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership.’”  Trudeau said days earlier that Canada would not be rushed into an agreement.  New Zealand’s Trade Minister David Parker told reporters that leaders who gathered for Friday’s meeting expecting a final report on the talks were surprised by Trudeau’s absence. Late Thursday, there had been “no distance between the parties,” he said.  Despite enthusiasm for sticking with the plan following the U.S. withdrawal under Trump in January, criticism over various issues persists. Detractors of the TPP say it favors corporate interests over labor and other rights. Trudeau said days before arriving in Danang that he would not be rushed into signing an agreement that did not suit Canada’s interests.  Aspects of the trade pact have raised hackles also over a requirement that companies be allowed to sue governments for lack of enforcement of related laws.  The proposed basic agreement reached in Danang said that the ministers maintained “the high standards, overall balance and integrity of the TPP while ensuring the commercial and other interests of all participants and preserving our inherent right to regulate, including the flexibility of the parties to set legislative and regulatory priorities.”  The TPP member countries are trying to find a way forward without the U.S., the biggest economy and, before Trump took office, one of its most assertive supporters. Trump has said he prefers country-to-country deals and is seeking to renegotiate several major trade agreements to, as he says, “put America first.”  Trump reiterated his markedly different stance on trade before the 21-member APEC summit convened late Friday with a gala banquet.  The U.S. president told an APEC business conference that “we are not going to let the United States be taken advantage of anymore.” He lambasted the World Trade Organization and other trade forums as unfair to the United States and reiterated his preference for bilateral trade deals, saying “I am always going to put America first.”  Trump said he would not enter into large trade agreements, alluding to U.S. involvement in the North American Free Trade Agreement and the TPP.  In contrast, Chinese President Xi Jinping told the same group that nations need to stay committed to economic openness or risk being left behind.  The Chinese president drew loud applause when he urged support for the “multilateral trading regime” and progress toward a free-trade zone in the Asia-Pacific. China is not part of the TPP.  APEC operates by consensus and customarily issues nonbinding statements. TPP commitments would eventually be ratified and enforced by its members.  But even talks this week on a declaration to cap the APEC summit had to be extended for an extra half day as ministers haggled over wording. It’s unclear what the exact sticking points were, but officials have alluded to differences over the unequal impact more open trade has had on workers and concerns over automation in manufacturing that could leave many millions in a wide array of industries with no work to do.  As a developing country with a fast-growing export sector, this year’s host country, Vietnam, has a strong interest in open trade and access for its exports to consumers in the West. The summit is an occasion for its leaders to showcase the progress its economy has made thanks largely to foreign investment and trade. Danang, Vietnam’s third largest city, is in the midst of a construction boom as dozens of resorts and smaller hotels pop up along its scenic coastline.  APEC’s members are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, the U.S. and Vietnam.  ___  Associated Press writer Robert Gillies in Toronto contributed to this report.",3.2,5,"[2.5, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 4.0]"

(Thomas Peter/Pool Photo via AP)  BEIJING (AP) — China took what it called a major step toward opening its financial industry with a promise Friday to ease limits on foreign ownership of banks and securities firms following a visit by U.S. President Donald Trump that was dominated by trade issues.  The announcement by a Cabinet official appeared to respond to mounting U.S. and European complaints that Beijing hampers foreign activity in a variety of industries in violation of free-trade commitments. The American Chamber of Commerce in China, which has appealed to Beijing to ease market barriers, said it looked forward to seeing details of the latest changes.  The announcement followed a series of multibillion-dollar contract signings with American companies during Trump’s visit in a tradition aimed at blunting criticism of Beijing’s trade surpluses and market barriers.  China will lift its limit on foreign ownership of securities, fund management and futures companies from a minority stake of 49 percent to a majority stake of 51 percent and end restrictions after three years, the official, Zhu Guangyao, said at a news briefing. He said a similar change would be made for life insurance companies and those would end in five years.  Regulators also will abolish restrictions that limit a single foreign investor’s stake in a Chinese bank to 20 percent and cap total foreign ownership of any institution at 25 percent, Zhu said.  “In other words, foreign owners can have full ownership of such companies” after three to five years, he said. “This opening up is decisive and the effect will be far-reaching.”  Beijing will also gradually reduce tariffs on automotive imports, Zhu said, without providing details.  The announcement came hours after Trump left Beijing to attend an Asia-Pacific economic meeting in Danang, Vietnam.  Asked about the timing of the changes announced Friday, Zhu cited President Xi Jinping’s comments at the ruling Communist Party’s twice-a-decade congress last month. Xi promised freer markets but also emphasized that Beijing wants to build up state-owned companies that dominate finance, energy and other industries.  American, European and other foreign companies complain that despite official pledges to open China’s economy, they are hampered by ownership limits and other restrictions in finance, health care and other promising industries.  “I look forward to seeing the details, as opening up the financial sector in particular could greatly improve the allocation of financial resources and support China’s future development,” William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber, said in an email. “These restrictions, and many others yet to be addressed, have been hindering economic activity in China for far too long.”  Ahead of Trump’s visit, the American Chamber had expressed concern that his focus on trade in goods might mean he paid less attention to complaints about restrictions on access to finance, health care and other industries in China’s state-dominated economy.  Trump has made narrowing the U.S. trade deficit with China — $347 billion last year — a priority. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that was a “central focus” of Trump’s talks with Xi.  Xi promised Thursday to open China’s state-dominated economy wider, but foreign companies have been disappointed when previous pledges of liberalization turned out to include restrictions that limited their impact.  For its part, Zhu said Beijing wants Washington to ease security-related export controls on high-tech goods and take action on what Beijing says is a promise to grant the country market-economy status.  China has pressed the United States for years to end controls on “dual use” technologies with both civilian and military uses such as supercomputers and advanced materials that can be used in warplanes and missiles.  Beijing says Washington and other governments agreed to grant market-economy status last year as part of China’s 2001 accession to the World Trade Organization. That would make it harder for them to bring anti-dumping and other cases against China.  The United States, the European Union, Japan and other governments reject China’s assertion and say Beijing has yet to follow through on liberalization required to qualify.  This week’s contract signings give Trump the opportunity to claim a rare political win following a first year in office marked by little legislative progress on health care and taxes.  Commerce Minister Zhong Shan said agreements signed Thursday at a ceremony attended by Trump and Xi totaled $253.4 billion, though many were memoranda of understanding or other arrangements that were less than firm contracts. Commercial sales announced appeared to total about $65 billion, many involving goods Chinese companies routinely buy.  That was on top of $9 billion in contracts signed by the two sides on Wednesday covering sales of soybeans, pork, beef and other goods.  Such contract signings are a fixture of visits to Beijing by foreign leaders and are meant to defuse trade complaints. They often represent purchases already made by Chinese mobile phone makers, airlines and other customers that are collected for the visit, which means they have little effect on the trade balance.",2.0,1,[2.0]

(AP Photo/Richard Vogel)  LOS ANGELES (AP) — A hawk named Riley soars between high-rises in downtown Los Angeles. Smaller birds take notice. And take flight.  Riley lands on a branch, surveys the concrete jungle below and swoops down to land on the gloved hand of her owner.  Blazer-clad professionals on their way to lunch do double-takes.

Their clients include the agricultural city of Oxnard, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and downtown Los Angeles’ U.S. Bank Tower, the second-tallest building west of the Mississippi River.  Most of the places they work are outdoor eating areas.  “What seagulls do in their aftermath when they eat, it’s pretty messy,” says Mike, 35.  Alyssa, 30, says pest birds are able to thrive in metropolitan areas because they feel safe there.  “They need shelter, food and water, and they’re finding it in these false environments basically that have sprinklers and fountains and food 24/7, but they’re also using the humans as a shield against the predators who are too scared to come in,” she says. “So by bringing in a predator that’s not afraid of people, it just ruins everything for the pigeons.”  A hawk named Riley soars between high rises in downtown Los Angeles.

1600,3310,11,10,2017,2017-11-10,Associated Press News,Animal rights groups demand action against Iowa fur farm," Federal inspectors have repeatedly ordered a southeast Iowa fur farm to improve the grim living conditions for ferrets, foxes, raccoons and skunks it sells to government laboratories and pet stores.  Many of the animals have been forced to live in sweltering heat or maggot-infested filth, sometimes with decomposing carcasses in their cages, officials found over the last two years.  So far no charges or enforcement action has been taken against the Ruby Fur Farm near New Sharon, 65 miles (105 kilometers) southeast of Des Moines. However, animal rights groups are calling for rescue of the animals, revocation of the farm’s federal license and fines for neglect.  U.S. Department of Agriculture inspectors documented the most recent problems when they returned to the farm seven times between December and August after finding suffering animals.  A building housing 290 raccoons reached 100 degrees in July, with many of the animals panting and drooling and 26 in “severe heat distress,” according to a July 21 inspection report.  Reports from 2015 show injured or sick raccoons as well as skunks and ferrets that didn’t receive veterinary treatment. In one cage a skunk was found living with its dead cage-mate.  A December 2016 report noted: “One dead, decomposing, headless juvenile ferret was found incorporated into the fecal material buildup on the wire floor in the corner of the cage,” which also housed a live adult and six juvenile ferrets.  Federal contracts show that even as USDA inspectors were writing up the reports about the farm’s treatment of raccoons, the agency was signing contracts to buy animals from the company for research. It spent nearly $30,000 in June and December of 2015 and in July 2016.  The business since 2007 received more than $67,000 from USDA contracts to provide skunks, raccoons, and foxes. USDA has expansive research enterprises with divisions that focus on food safety, animal health and food production improvements. One of the contracts indicates raccoons were obtained by a USDA lab in Colorado focusing on wildlife diseases, and another noted young foxes would be used as “research models.”  The farm is licensed to Randy Ruby as a registered federal dealer by the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, and it holds state permits as an animal dealer and a pet shop.  Ruby declined to discuss the reports with The Associated Press when reached by telephone. He referred calls to The Cavalry Group, a Missouri-based animal business advocacy organization to which he is a member.  Its president, Mindy Patterson, said some of the USDA inspectors’ claims are exaggerated and when there has been an issue Ruby has addressed them immediately.  “What we witnessed up close and personal this summer was Randy Ruby’s farm being targeted and harassed with hyper-aggressive inspections,” she said. “We have time-tested agriculture practices to ensure the health and safety of both people and animals that are being redefined as inhumane treatment of animals by these groups who have nothing but an emotion-based agenda.”  The farm’s website says it has been in business for more than 65 years and raises “our animals with tender, loving care, and we can ship them anywhere in the world.”  Michael Budkie, executive director of Stop Animal Exploitation Now, an Ohio-based nonprofit that monitors U.S. research and animal holding facilities, has called for the termination of the fur farm’s federal animal dealer’s license and rescue of the animals.  In an Oct. 16 letter to Robert Gibbens, a veterinarian and the USDA’s director of Animal Welfare Operations based in Colorado, Budkie asked the agency to fine Ruby Fur Farm. He said inspection reports clearly demonstrate “a total disregard for the health and well-being of these animals.”  USDA spokesman R. Andre Bell confirmed the agency has discussed the farm with an animal rights group but declined to say whether it was considering enforcement action or terminating the license. He also declined to discuss whether USDA’s purchased of animals from the fur farm had any impact on its enforcement of animal welfare regulations.  The Iowa Department of Agriculture, which has issued state permits for the farm to operate as a pet shop and registered federal dealer, has no enforcement action pending, said spokesman Dustin Vande Hoef. The agency can revoke the permits if it were to find standard of care issues but it has received no complaints, he said.  Any animal neglect charges must come from a law enforcement officer under Iowa law.  Mahaska County Sheriff Russ VanRenterghem said he accompanied a USDA inspection team to the fur farm three or four times in July.  “I don’t see any violations,” he said, describing the farm’s owners as “very reputable, very good people.”  Iowa is ranked the second worst in the nation for animal welfare behind Kentucky, according to the Animal Legal Defense Fund’s annual rankings released in January.  Iowa enforcement is weak because with a few exceptions animal neglect is not considered a felony, and laws defining adequate shelter conditions are unclear, the group said.  “In general if I was picking a state to be an animal in, Iowa would be very far down my list,” said David Rosengard, a staff attorney for the group’s criminal justice program. “I could be neglected. I could be starved. I could be abandoned and the person who did that wouldn’t face the sort of repercussions they would have to deal with in a lot of other states.”  ___  Sign up for the AP’s weekly newsletter showcasing our best reporting from the Midwest and Texas: http://apne.ws/2u1RMfv .",1.5,2,"[2.0, 1.0]"

A survey conducted by Bucknell University political science professor Christopher Ellis posed two options to respondents:  “In order to promote intellectual engagement, colleges should never prohibit speech for any reason.”  “In order to keep students from feeling unsafe, colleges should have the right to prohibit certain kinds of speech.”  Fortunately, nearly eight in 10 (78 percent) of respondents chose the first option, affirming the tradition of free expression upon which American academia was founded. Support for no restrictions on speech was most prevalent amongst Republicans, men, older Americans, and the more educated.  However, nearly half of the respondents argued that certain types of speech should be restricted on campus. Another survey question asked respondents about different types of speech and whether or not those types should be restricted. 59 percent of Democrats argued that colleges should be able to restrict speech that makes students feel uncomfortable or unsafe as opposed to 47 percent of Republicans. 55 percent of Democrats said that colleges should restrict speech perceived to be sexist as opposed to 35 percent of Republicans. 62 percent of Democrats said that colleges should restrict speech considered offensive to racial minorities as opposed to 31 percent of Republicans. An overwhelming 65 percent of Republicans argued that colleges should restrict the teaching of radical ideas as opposed to 41 percent of Democrats.  (Source: Washington Post)  In another survey question, respondents were provided a statement that argued that students should fight for freedom of speech and expression on campus. Respondents were overwhelmingly more inclined to agree with the statement when told that it came from a member of their political party. For instance, 83 percent of Democrats agreed with the statement when it was attributed to Barack Obama. Only 58 percent of Democrats agreed with it when it was attributed to Vice President Mike Pence.  (Source: Washington Post)  “Americans support free expression as an abstract principle. But they also believe that even protected speech can have real costs. Perhaps the public is ambivalent or confused about the issue,” Ellis concluded. “But they are also responding to the complex question of campus free speech, where schools must balance two competing goals: promoting free and open exchange, and creating an environment safe for learning and development.”",3.0,3,"[3.5, 3.0, 2.5]"
1587,3287,11,10,2017,2017-11-10,The New York Times,California Looks at Republican Tax Measures and Sees Payback,"On the Democratic side, Anthony Rendon, the Assembly speaker, called the bill “anti-California,” and said he was surprised that so few California Republicans had spoken against it, especially in contrast to Republicans in other states, like New York, that would also be hurt.  “It’s to a large extent political suicide for a lot of these folks,” he said, “and they don’t seem to care.”  Like everything in the tax measure, affordable-housing credits are a moving target. The House version eliminated a lot of things, and the Senate version restored some of them. But as Republican legislators shape a bill that delivers a big cut in corporate taxes while remaining within deficit limits that allow a party-line vote, the houses have consistently looked at reducing credits and deductions whose ripple effects would be minimal in most of the country but profound for taxpayers who live, generally, in Democratic states.  For instance, both the House and Senate bills either reduce or repeal the deduction for state income, sales and property taxes. California’s top personal income-tax rate is the nation’s highest.  The House bill lowered the limit on the mortgage-interest deduction for new home purchases from $1 million in debt to $500,000. That move would affect fewer than 3 percent of mortgage holders nationally, and there are only four metropolitan areas in the United States where more than half of the homes are priced above $500,000. All four are in California. (The Senate bill keeps the limit at $1 million.)  Also, no state benefits more from itemized deductions, which the bills limit, and in many cases discourage, by increasing the standard deduction. Economic models suggest that the bulk of the millions of families that would face tax increases under the legislation itemize their deductions.  More than a third of Californians itemize their deductions, according to data compiled by the Pew Charitable Trusts; the average benefit from those deductions was nearly $37,000 in 2015.  California is not the only state whose voters would lose deductions from the tax bill. According to an analysis by the Tax Foundation, an independent think tank, six states — California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Texas and Pennsylvania — claim more than half of the total amount deducted for state and local taxes.",4.5,1,[4.5]

The vulnerability, which Appthority has described as ""easy"" to exploit, would allow an attacker to ""access confidential knowledge about a company's business dealings and make moves to capitalize on them for extorting actions or personal gain,"" Bentley added.  Collectively, the affected apps have been downloaded around 180 million times. Moreover, more than 170 of the affected apps are currently available in official app stores today.

Debbie Wesson Gibson says that she was 17 in the spring of 1981 when Moore spoke to her Etowah High School civics class about serving as the assistant district attorney. She says that when he asked her out, she asked her mother what she would say if she wanted to date a 34-year-old man. Gibson says her mother asked her who the man was, and when Gibson said “Roy Moore,” her mother said, “I’d say you were the luckiest girl in the world.” Among locals in Gadsden, a town of about 47,000 back then, Moore “had this godlike, almost deity status — he was a hometown boy made good,” Gibson says, “West Point and so forth.”  Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?

[VIDEO]  Here are a few anti-Trump posts that were found on Gibson’s Facebook page:  One of senatorial candidate Roy Moore’s accusers is apparently a fervent Democrat who has worked for the DNC as a sign language interpreter for Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden, a revelation which the Washington Post never included in its original report.  The accuser, Debbie Gibson, had also publically supported Moore’s opponent Doug Jones before the accusations came to light.  Gibson openly bragged about signing for Hillary during a campaign appearance. On a side note, we’re not sure who she’s signing for. The crowd behind Hillary, that is usually packed with the Democrats hand-picked “diverse” crowd, appears to be pretty thin.  Here’s a post from Gibson’s page proving that she’s supporting Judge Roy Moore’s Democrat opponent for US Senate:  She even posted a video of Moore’s opponent, Doug Jones to promote him to her friends on Facebook. The screenshot below shows the post on her page.  Interestingly, when attacking Moore ally Steve Bannon for suggesting the Washington Post was politically motivated in its reporting, the newspaper implied that Gibson wasn’t “down with Democratic propaganda,” a statement which seemingly conflicts with Gibson’s political activism:  That’s not what the photos say…  The Washington Post reported:  “According to campaign reports, none of the women has donated to or worked for Moore’s Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, or his rivals in the Republican primary…”  But notice the precise wording; it’s lawyer-speak. It might very well be true that Gibson didn’t donate or work for Doug Jones, but according to her Facebook profile, she did actively campaign for him, which doesn’t help her credibility and it should have been reported – yet the Washington Post conveniently left it out.",0.5,1,[0.5]
1594,3299,11,10,2017,2017-11-10,Vox,Conservatives probably can’t be persuaded on climate change. So now what?,"When it comes to climate change, US conservatives inhabit a unique position, as part of the only major political party in the democratic world to reject the legitimacy of climate science and any domestic policy or international agreement meant to address it. Instead, the GOP is working actively to increase production and consumption of fossil fuels and to slow the transition to renewable energy.  How can conservatives be moved on climate change?  I recently heard a podcast that helped me order my thoughts on this perennial debate. It was Political Research Digest, a weekly 15-minute research round-up hosted by Michigan State University political scientist Matt Grossman for the Niskanen Center. (Grossman is the author of Asymmetric Politics, a crucial text for understanding American political parties. The podcast is nerdy and good.)  In the third episode, Grossman takes a look at some recent literature on climate change opinion and how, if at all, it can be shifted among conservatives.  It begins well, with an excellent lay of the land. But the discussion of how to move forward goes off course, in a very familiar way. It stops short of contemplating the uncomfortable but increasingly likely possibility that persuading conservatives on this subject has become impossible, and what that might mean for those concerned about the looming dangers of climate change.  Let’s start with a look a few basic facts about public opinion on climate.  Public concern about climate change hasn’t risen much, but it has polarized  The first part of the episode is about a new literature review on climate change opinion in Annual Review of Political Science. Patrick Egan and Megan Mullin, of New York and Duke Universities respectively, survey a ton of recent research on the subject and pull out a few conclusions.  Grossman has Mullin on to discuss it and she’s great, emphasizing lots of important stuff that journalists writing in this area often miss. Here are a few conclusions drawn from the review:  There has been an increase in general climate change awareness over the past few decades, but very little increase in understanding of how it works (that humans are the primary cause is believed by fewer than half of Americans, still) or intensity of concern (almost no voters rank climate change among their top concerns).  Aggregate opinion has remained relatively stable, but underneath, there has been sharp and ongoing partisan polarization, which continues today. (See this post for more on that.)  Though “striking in the case of climate change,” this polarization is part of a larger trend in the US. Everything has been swept up in it; climate is not separate or unique.  Opinion polls show something of a spike in concern about climate in 2016 to 2017, but almost all the movement has come from Democrats; it’s not yet clear whether it will last.  “The conventional wisdom gets the causal arrow backwards,” says Mullin. People don’t develop political and policy opinions based on an assessment of climate science. They assess climate science based on preexisting political and policy opinions. That’s why trying to change minds with science-based arguments is so rarely effective.  As Mullin says, there is no sign on the horizon that this polarization — either generally or on climate change — is going to abate any time soon. She is skeptical that a sweeping change in public opinion will come along and force politicians of both parties to join together and pass national legislation.  So far, so good. (Well, “good.”) The question is, where do we go from here?  At this point, to my great frustration, the discussion inevitably turns to messaging — to what magic combinations of words can change conservative minds. I have been watching variants of these discussions for over a decade, as national security, adaptation, green jobs, and geoengineering have been serially hyped as the key to conservative hearts on climate change. (None, obviously, have worked.)  The pivot to messaging, to mass persuasion, hinges on two important hidden premises. Grossman and Mullin touch on them glancingly ... but then Grossman turns the discussion to a different kind of research — the wrong kind, in this author’s humble opinion.  Let’s follow along and then we’ll double back.  Magic words only work in isolation  The next bit of research Grossman highlights is by a team of researchers led by Graham Dixon of Ohio State University, published in June in the journal Science Communication.  Dixon’s team found that, in surveys, conservative opinion on climate solutions could not be moved by scientific or religious messages, but it could be nudged in a positive direction by messages that stressed “free market solutions.”  Core values, not science, are what drive conservative opposition, Dixon tells Grossman, and “free markets” are a core value for conservatives. They view climate policy as a threat to free markets, which is the real reason they reject climate science, so messaging should assuage those fears.  This is wrong.  1) First, the idea that free markets are a core value of today’s US conservatives should provoke only laughter. If Donald Trump’s campaign and victory taught us nothing else, it is that the conservative base’s fealty to open markets is paper thin. Trump promised trade barriers, tariffs, and walls, to the gaping consternation of the conservative monied class, and paid no penalty at all.  And well before Trump, it was clear that “free markets” are, in political practice, a slogan, not a core value. The slogan is a weapon to be deployed against policies that favor conservative’s enemies, but never against their friends, just as deficits are used to scold Democrats who want to spend money but never Republicans who want to cut taxes.  Trump’s Department of Energy is vigorously working to dump subsidies on coal companies as we speak, to take but one example, and the Republican rank and file does not seem particularly put out by it. Nor do they seem moved by the earnest arguments of libertarians that unregulated pollution amounts to a market-distorting subsidy, a violation of free market principles.  Conservatives, like everyone with any power in US politics, support policies that help people and interests they favor and oppose policies that help people and interests they don’t favor. In truth, no one outside of DC think tanks values free (i.e., unregulated) markets as such, in any consistent way.  Insofar as the Republican base has revealed core values, they seem to consist almost entirely in hostility to the Other — liberals and Democrats above all, along with the minorities, immigrants, professors, and celebrities they represent.  2) More importantly, opinions aren’t formed in a vacuum, they’re formed in life, and in life, one is always surrounded by tribes enforcing worldviews in millions of explicit and implicit ways. Knowledge and motivation are social phenomena, not individual phenomena. Even if conservatives could be convinced of “free market” solutions to climate change, show me more than a handful of conservatives willing to prioritize their alleged fealty to free markets over the good opinion of their peers and tribal leaders. Show me a GOP politician willing to put their alleged fealty to free markets over the good opinion of their constituents and their chances of reelection.  For climate campaigners, delivering “free market” messages on climate change in the social context where the conservative base lives — surrounded by an increasingly impenetrable and message-coordinated media bubble — is like blowing spitwads into a hurricane.  Words do not have magic powers and clever messages cannot do the work of politics. Social forces, not “messages,” shape political engagement.  3) Most importantly of all, we must note that it’s not true that climate solutions necessarily involve violence to free market principles. A market in which some participants are allowed to degrade the planet for all future generations without cost is not “free” by any sane definition of that term. If you piss all over my leg, I’m not abridging your freedom by asking you to pay for new pants.  So, if it’s not true that climate solutions necessarily violate the allegedly core conservative principle of free markets ... who told them that? Why do the conservative masses think that? How have they all gravitated toward the facially odd position that the ongoing health of fossil fuel companies is the only way to secure American liberty?  Well, that brings us back to our hidden premises. As promised, let’s double back.  Elites shape opinion, only elites can change it  Say we accept that the majority of hardcore conservatives have negative opinions on climate change, and they see those opinions as reflective of deep ideological values. What should be done about it?  There are two hidden premises that typically inform such discussions.  The first is that the only sensible response is to persuade all those conservatives. That’s why the focus inevitably turns to messaging and “framing,” the endless search for the right tone of voice, the right combination of arguments, the right mix of facts, stories, and imagery, to move the conservative mind. That’s what so many thousands of hours of effort have gone toward over the last decades.  But it’s backward, as Mullin says. Assessments of science follow political opinions, they do not precede them.  And how are political opinions shaped in the real world?  Well, as I’ve written many times, public opinion is not some great enduring mystery. There’s a decent consensus in the social sciences on what most moves public opinion: elite cues.  And so it is with climate change. Drexel University sociologist Robert Brulle has been all over this for years — see, e.g., this recent paper with McGill’s Jason Carmichael. Science-based educational campaigns have virtually no effect on climate opinion, they found. Weather events and economic swings have some temporary effects. What moves the needle are elite cues.  That’s just a fancy way of saying that people care more about something when they see it around them, when they read it in the newspaper, see it on TV, hear politicians discussing it, see activists in the streets marching about it, watch celebrities pretending to care about it. Those are all elite cues.  That’s the stuff that shapes ordinary people’s opinions, on all sides of the political spectrum. Very few individuals have the time and wherewithal to investigate the world’s woes independently. They absorb the values and worldviews of their tribes.  Conservatives think climate change is a communist plot because that’s what the right’s elites have told them.  The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012  I don't believe Hurricane Harvey is God's punishment for Houston electing a lesbian mayor. But that is more credible than ""climate change."" https://t.co/K7d7mopY5Q — Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) August 29, 2017  EPA administrator Scott Pruitt said that CO2 emitted by human activity is not the key cause of climate change. https://t.co/kQZP92JnB1 — NRDC (@NRDC) March 19, 2017  All the elite cues that surround conservatives in their epistemic bubble reinforce this message: Climate change science is bogus and all proposed climate solutions are plots to grow the size of government and take your money.  The good news is that if conservative elite opinion swung around on climate change, conservative mass opinion would swing easily behind. Nobody really cares about “issues” like this beyond how they inform social identity anyway. Very few people beyond the Heritage Foundation have any independent commitment to flat-earthism on climate.  The bad news is that no one knows how to persuade conservative elites to stop lying to their tribe about climate change.  For one thing, fossil fuel companies play an enormous role in funding the party (and climate denying “think tanks”); the material interests of politicians like Scott Pruitt and Ryan Zinke are bound up in the good graces of fossil fuel executives. What counterbalancing force is there, with the power to nullify or even diminish that influence?  For another, conservative media elites profit the more they work their audiences into a frenzy of paranoia, fear, and loathing toward the left. Bashing on everything the left does is good for clicks and viewers. It is literally money in their pockets. What counterbalancing force is there, with the power to bring about bipartisanship on this one issue?  Honestly, persuading conservative elites seems almost as futile as persuading the conservative masses. Almost all their tangible incentives point the other way.  It might seem hopeless. But that brings us to the second hidden premise.  If it’s a fight, not a debate, then intensity is what matters  The second premise, deeper and more foundational, is that politics works through agreement — that getting everyone on the same page is a prerequisite of political progress. We must “meet in the middle.” Especially among US center-left elites, this belief is practically preverbal, a truism.  But history, especially recent history, contains much evidence to the contrary. Just about every substantial policy shift in the US in the past 20 years has been a matter of one side overwhelming the other — of conflict, not consensus. Some were “bipartisan” in the sense that a few legislators crossed the aisle, but partisan unity is more and more the rule in US politics. We have “weak parties and strong partisanship,” as political scientist Julia Azari puts it, which makes substantial compromise more and more difficult.  “Pundits who say that ‘nothing can get done without bipartisan support’,” write Steven Teles, Heather Hurlburt, and Mark Schmitt in one of my favorite essays on polarization, “no longer have the evidence on their side.” In fact, that increasingly looks like the only way anything ever gets done.  So what would a less-persuading-more-fighting strategy look like?  There’s also this deliberative, “why can’t we all get along” view of politics lurking under the surface. Instead of, say, agonism: https://t.co/FjOUlqyxxN — Joseph Henderson (@josephenderson) November 8, 2017  Agonism (thanks to Henderson, a climate-focused social scientist, for the tweet tip) is the view that in some contexts and within limits, political conflict is good. Sometimes conflict clarifies, educates, and leads to progress.  Sometimes the right strategy is to grab and own an issue, to exclude (not invite) the other party, to tie the issue to core coalition values and use the intensity to increase the political power of the coalition.  That’s what the right did with national security during the Cold War. They claimed the issue, associated themselves with it, commanded public trust on it, and — crucially — worked overtime to exclude the left from it, to make Democrats look weak and feckless. They didn’t beg Democrats to agree with their hawkishness. They dared them to disagree.  They made a fight of it, and they won. That’s why Democrats’ unofficial slogan for much of the ‘90s and early ‘00s was, “Hey, We’re Tough Too!”  The left has never been as good at unified aggression and probably never will be, for reasons Grossman’s book explains well.  But it may be time to face the fact that there is no magic message, no persuasive strategy, that can get us out of this mess. There’s no persuading the conservative base without conservative elites and there’s no persuading conservative elites as long as their material interests point the wrong direction.  It may just be that we’re not all going to get along — that the only way to move forward on this is to fight it out.  If that’s true, then what matters most on the left is not the breadth of agreement, but the depth. It is intensity that wins political battles. The only way Democrats can achieve progress on this is to intensify the fight.  Tepid “free market” messages, forever hoping to win over an unwinnable right, won’t do that. They do nothing to inspire those who already care and are primed for action.  Figuring out endless ways to avoid saying the words “climate change” won’t do that. Gimmicks don’t persuade or inspire; visible passion and conviction do.  For Democrats, raising intensity would mean making it a fight, staking a claim, defining the core values involved, telling vivid stories with heroes and villains and repeating them frequently. It would mean making climate change and clean energy tier-one priorities — organizing around them, talking about them at every opportunity, pushing them into the news and popular culture.  It would mean, rather than begging Republicans for assent or small scraps of policy assistance, doing everything possible to publicize their intransigence and make it core to their identity. Tie it around their necks every time a microphone appears; make them own it.  Reality still matters. What we have in the US is not a “difference of opinion” about climate change, it’s conservatives being mistaken about some very basic facts. They’re mistaken because they’ve been lied to and misled by leaders and influencers within their own tribe.  That’s the situation. But it’s not stable. The weather is only getting worse, young people are only getting more engaged, and clean energy is only getting cheaper. Climate change and clean energy will be winning issues in the long term.  Why not claim and own them while it’s still possible? Then the GOP’s motto in the 2020s can be: “Hey, We Like Clean Energy Too!”  In reality, Democrats probably don’t have the wherewithal to mount that kind of fight. But that’s the only thing that has a chance of breaking the stalemate. The quest to persuade US conservatives on climate change has been extraordinarily long, vigorous, and well-documented. It has also been largely fruitless. Perhaps it’s time for a little agonism.",2.75,2,"[1.5, 4.0]"

(Oliver Berg/dpa via AP)  BONN, Germany (AP) — Environmental activists protested at a German coal-fired power plant on Friday — the same day that Italy became the latest country to announce a deadline for ending its use of the heavily polluting fossil fuel.  Protesters projected images of Pacific islanders threatened by climate change onto the cooling tower of the lignite-fuelled power station in Neurath, in western Germany, along with the words “coal destroys our future.”  The visual display, organized by representatives of Pacific island nations and the environmental group Greenpeace, took place as diplomats from around the world are meeting in nearby Bonn to discuss implementing the 2015 Paris climate accord.  The German government claims to be a leader in the fight against climate change but has refused to set a date for phasing out the use of coal, which emits large amounts of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide when burned. Coal accounts for about 40 percent of Germany’s energy mix.  Several other countries, however, have set a cutoff date for coal, including Italy, which announced it will stop using coal for its national electricity needs by 2025.  Italy’s plan calls for investments of 175 billion euros ($203.5 billion) through 2030 in infrastructure, renewable energy and energy efficiency development. According to government statistics, coal provided 16 percent of Italy’s national electricity in 2015.  Italy’s new energy strategy calls for carbon emissions from energy use to decrease 39 percent by 2030 and 63 percent by 2050.  Coal has become a key issue at the Bonn climate talks. Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore told delegates there Friday that making the switch away from fossil fuels won’t be easy given the industry’s political clout, but that it makes both environmental and financial sense.  “It is insane to force taxpayers to subsidize the destruction of our civilization, and of course, the coal and gas and oil lobbies have a lot of political power,” Gore said. “They built it up over a hundred years, and they have the influence with politicians, not only in my country, but also in China, also in Japan.”  U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters Friday in New York that he will urge participants at Bonn conference to respond to the latest alarming data by further cutting emissions, helping countries respond to climate shocks and mobilizing the $100 billion promised to help developing countries.  He said recent reports send two messages: “accelerate climate action — and raise ambition.”  The 2015 Paris climate accord set a target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) — or 2 degrees at the most — by the end of the century.  Guterres pointed to new worrying data: The World Meteorological Organization reported that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reached new highs in 2016. A U.N. Environment Program report showed that greenhouse gas levels are likely to be so elevated in 2020 that reaching Paris targets for 2030 will be very hard to meet.  Guterres warned that the window of opportunity to keep temperatures to the 2-degree target “may close in 20 years or less — and we may have only five years to bend the emissions curve toward 1.5 degrees.”  “We need at least a further 25 percent cut in emissions by 2020,” he said.  Guterres also called for greater action by governments, businesses and citizens to combat climate change, and he announced he will hold a climate summit “to mobilize political and economic energy at the highest levels” in September 2019.  ___  Jordans reported from Berlin.

The House and Senate tax overhaul plans are broadly similar, but crucial differences create headaches for Republican leaders determined to keep myriad interest groups and factions of the GOP satisfied.(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)  WASHINGTON (AP) — The House and Senate tax overhaul plans are broadly similar, but crucial differences are creating headaches for Republican leaders determined to keep myriad interest groups and factions of the GOP satisfied. And then there’s the ambitious timetable they’ve set of finishing in time to get legislation to President Donald Trump by Christmas.  The most politically challenging decisions involve dealing with popular and widely used tax deductions, structuring tax cuts for business and balancing personal income tax rates between middle-class families and the rich.  All of these decisions come against a generous — but firm — 10-year, $1.5 trillion cap on the measure’s cost to the federal deficit. Both House and Senate have adopted accounting gimmicks to squeeze tax cuts that appear larger down to fit that restraint.  Trump’s enormously expensive demand for a cut in the corporate tax rate to 20 percent — from the current 35 percent — is a big complication, as is unrest among House Republicans hailing from affluent suburban districts who are upset over the proposed loss of the deduction for state income taxes.  Here’s a rundown on the major differences between the House and Senate bills:  INDIVIDUAL TAX RATES  The Senate measure keeps the current number of personal income tax brackets, seven, though it changes the rates to 10, 12, 22.5, 25, 32.5, 35 and 38.5 percent. That last top bracket for the wealthiest earners carries a higher rate of 39.6 percent under current law.  The House bill goes further toward simplifying the tax system. It shrinks the number of brackets from seven to four, with rates of 12, 25, 35 and 39.6 percent.  Lots of numbers here for congressional negotiators to play with, to move up or down.  The inheritance tax on multimillion dollar estates, called the estate tax, is an especially hot-button issue. Democrats point to the proposed GOP changes as proof that the Republicans are out to help wealthy people like Trump and his family.  Currently, when someone dies, the person inheriting the estate must pay taxes on its value above $5.5 million for individuals, $11 million for couples. The House bill initially doubles those limits and then repeals the whole tax after 2023. The Senate version doubles those exemption amounts — but doesn’t repeal the tax.  To repeal or not to repeal? That may be the class-warfare question.  DEDUCTIONS  The Senate bill would eliminate a taxpayer’s ability to deduct state income taxes and local property taxes. But the final bill may have to closely track a House compromise that provides a property tax deduction of up to $10,000 or else risk a revolt from GOP lawmakers from New York, New Jersey, and California.  The Senate bill preserves popular individual tax breaks for large medical expenses, mortgage interest, electric vehicles and college costs that were targeted by the House. The House limits deductibility of mortgage interest to the first $500,000 of a loan, riling the real estate and housing industries, and eliminates a deduction for medical expenses that’s often taken by families facing crippling nursing home costs.  BUSINESS:  Both the House and Senate versions slash the tax rate for corporations to 20 percent from the current 35 percent. But there’s a big twist: The Senate bill delays the rate cut for a year.  The delay was put in to reduce the bill’s cost by $100 billion or so — but it’s opposed by the White House and House Republicans. Wall Street hates it too. U.S. stock markets sold off Thursday in response to news of the proposed deferral, with industrial and technology stocks leading the decline, before recouping some of the losses by the close of trading.  Might the implementation delay be traded for a smaller corporate tax cut, something above 20 percent?  Trump actually had been demanding 15 percent and reportedly was initially furious at the 20 percent figure. The issue is setting the corporate rate at a level that experts and tax writers believe would bring the U.S. closer to its overseas competitors.  The electric car industry — notably makers Tesla and Chevrolet — and producers of wind power for generating electricity are losers under the House bill. The tax credit of up to $7,500 for plug-in electric vehicles would be repealed, and the credit for wind energy would be reduced. But the Senate version retains the incentives.  The loss of tax credits for renewable energy would free billions to help pay for the corporate tax cuts in the legislation. But in addition to environmentalists’ objections, the prospect also angers some Republican senators, including powerful Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who has vowed to defend the credit.  There’s a special rate for businesses whose profits are counted in the owners’ personal tax returns. Millions of U.S. businesses use this “pass-through” format. The House bill taxes many of them at a maximum 25 percent, down from 39.6 percent currently, and adds a lower minimum rate. The Senate version would set a new 17.4 percent deduction for “pass-through” income, aimed to help smaller businesses.",4.0,1,[4.0]

1564,3232,11,10,2017,2017-11-10,Associated Press News,White House: No formal Trump-Putin meeting on Asia trip,"President Donald Trump arrives at Danang International Airport, Friday, Nov. 10, 2017, in Danang, Vietnam. Trump is on a five country trip through Asia traveling to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)  DANANG, Vietnam (AP) — President Donald Trump will not have a formal sit-down with Russian President Vladimir Putin while the two attend a summit, the White House said Friday shortly before Trump landed in Vietnam, the fourth stop on his first official visit to Asia.  Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force Once, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders blamed scheduling conflicts on both sides for the fact that the leaders will not meet formally during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit taking place in the coastal city of Danang.  But Sanders said it was “possible” and “likely” that they could have a less formal encounter, either in Danang or later in the Philippines when Trump and Putin attend another regional conference.  “Now, they’re going to be in the same place. Are they going to bump into each other and say hello? Certainly possible and likely,” she said. “But in terms of a scheduled, formal meeting, there’s not one on the calendar and we don’t anticipate that there will be one.”  U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had told reporters in Beijing on Thursday that there was no reason to schedule a meeting if the U.S. and Russia are unable to make significant progress on issues including Syria and Ukraine.  US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping agree on the need to implement all United Nations Security Council resolutions on North Korea. (Nov. 9)  “The view has been if the two leaders are going to meet, is there something sufficiently substantive to talk about that would warrant a formal meeting,” he said.  Both sides have been working to reach agreement on how they hope to resolve Syria’s civil war once the Islamic State group is defeated. The potential understanding comes as an array of forces are near a final defeat of IS, the extremist group that once controlled vast stretches of both Iraq and Syria. Fighting the group is no longer top priority, shifting the focus back to Syria’s intractable conflict between Russian-backed President Bashar Assad’s government and armed rebels, to whom the U.S. lends at least rhetorical support.  The news comes a day after Trump set aside his blistering rhetoric in favor of friendly overtures to China on Thursday, trying to flatter his hosts into establishing a more balanced trade relationship and doing more to blunt North Korea’s nuclear ambitions.  Winding down his two days in Beijing, Trump suggested that if the U.S. and China jointly took on the world’s problems, “I believe we can solve almost all of them, and probably all of them.”  In the name of furthering that relationship, Trump largely shelved his campaign complaints about China, at least in public. He focused on exhorting Beijing to help with North Korea, an effort expected again to take center stage at an international summit in Vietnam on Friday.  The Chinese rolled out a lavish welcome for the American president. Trump returned the kindness, heaping praise on China’s Xi Jinping and predicting the two powers would work around entrenched differences. On Twitter later, Trump called his meetings with Xi “very productive on both trade and the subject of North Korea.”  On trade, Trump criticized the “very one-sided and unfair” relationship between the U.S. and China. But unlike his approach during the campaign, when he castigated China for what he contended were inappropriate trade practices, Trump said Thursday that he didn’t blame the Chinese for having taken advantage of the U.S.  Trump said China “must immediately address the unfair trade practices” that drive a “shockingly” large trade deficit, along with barriers to market access, forced technology transfers and intellectual property theft.  “But I don’t blame China,” he said. “After all, who can blame a country for being able to take advantage of another country for the benefit of its citizens?”  To applause, Trump said, “I give China great credit.”  Reacting from afar, Sen. Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, said Trump’s comments “make the United States look weak and as if we are bowing to China’s whim. ... Instead of giving China credit for stealing American jobs, the president should be holding China accountable.” Menendez, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is on trial for alleged bribery.  Tillerson offered a blunt assessment of China’s trade surplus with the United States, which in October widened by 12.2 percent from a year earlier to $26.6 billion. The total surplus with the United States for the first 10 months of the year was $223 billion.  “I think the best way to characterize it is that while we appreciate the long hours and the effort that our Chinese counterparts have put into those trade discussions, quite frankly in the grand scheme of a $300- to $500-billion trade deficit, the things that have been achieved are pretty small,” Tillerson told reporters in Beijing.  Tillerson also acknowledged there were differences in “tactics and the timing and how far to go with pressure” on North Korea. But he insisted that the two countries shared common objectives.  “There is no disagreement on North Korea,” he said.  The comments by Trump and his top diplomat came after lengthy meetings with Xi. The day included announcements that the U.S. and China had signed agreements valued at more than $250 billion for products including U.S.-made jet engines, auto parts, liquefied natural gas and beef.  Such contract signings, a fixture of foreign leaders’ visits to Beijing, are intended to defuse complaints about China’s trade policies.  Xi promised a more open business environment for foreign companies in China and said his country was committed to further opening its economy to outside investment.  “China will not close its doors” and will open them “even wider,” he said, pledging that foreign companies in China, including American ones, would find the market “more open, more transparent and more orderly.”  It is unclear how far China will go to fulfill its pledges. Previous U.S. administrations have hailed market-opening promises only to be left disappointed.  Before arriving in China, Trump had delivered a stern message to Beijing, using an address in South Korea to call on China, North Korea’s biggest trade partner, to do more to confront and isolate the North.  Trump appeared far more conciliatory on Thursday, thanking China for its efforts and saying he’d been encouraged by his conversations.  “China can fix this problem easily. And quickly. And I am calling on China and your great president to hopefully work on it very hard,” Trump said. “If he works on it hard it will happen.”  ___  Associated Press writers Christopher Bodeen in Beijing and Darlene Superville and Ken Thomas in Washington contributed to this report.  ___  Follow Colvin on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@colvinj and Lemire at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire",4.0,1,[4.0]

Trump and Putin smiled and stood next to each other for the traditional group photograph. Then they parted to sit at different parts of the table.  The White House said earlier that no formal meeting was planned because of scheduling conflicts on both sides, though it was possible they would bump into each other.  “In terms of a scheduled, formal meeting, there’s not one on the calendar and we don’t anticipate that there will be one,” White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters minutes before landing in Danang.  The main meeting of leaders from APEC countries is on Saturday in the Vietnamese resort city of Danang. Trump is on the fourth leg of a 12-day tour of Asia.

1592,3297,11,10,2017,2017-11-10,Vox,"Starting Monday, calorie counts on menus are going to be mandatory","It’s finally happening. After nearly a decade of delays, Trump’s Food and Drug Administration is implementing an Obama-era policy on Monday that will require restaurants and other food outlets with 20 or more locations to post calorie counts.  Any big chain — from grocery stores to movie theaters, amusement parks to vending machines to restaurants — will have to show how many calories come with their sandwiches, popcorn, cocktails, beer, wine, and french fries. Up front. Right on the menus.  In some eateries, menu labeling is already happening. Several major chains started to move in this direction voluntarily because the FDA was expected to finalize this regulation years ago. It’s why you can see that the grande latte at Starbucks has 190 calories, the turkey, apple, and cheddar sandwich at Panera has 710 calories, and McDonald’s Big Mac packs 530 calories, for example.  But we’ll now be flooded with calorie data. And while these changes aren’t expected to cause Americans to suddenly clean up their diets, they could have profound indirect effects on how we think about food and nutrition, what we choose from the menu, and ultimately what restaurants serve.  We now get most of our calories from eating out — but it’s been hard to count those calories  Americans do a lot of their eating outside of the home these days. More than half of the money spent on food goes to restaurants and convenient on-the-go meals — not to groceries cooked at home.  Make no mistake: When we dine out, we eat more. People typically consume 20 to 40 percent more calories in restaurants compared with what they’d eat at home.  As Tuft University researchers found, in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, restaurant dishes at non-chain establishments across the country typically contained 1,200 calories — about half of the 2,000 or 2,500 calories recommended for moderately active women and men in an entire day. For these reasons, the American propensity to dine out has been linked with the obesity epidemic.  For a long time, consumers were left to operate blindly when it came to how many calories they were consuming when dining out. Unlike the nutrition facts panels that come with preprepared foods we eat at home, there was no such transparency around restaurant food.  Then along came the Affordable Care Act in 2010. Buried among its many provisions were rules requiring ""retail food establishments"" with 20 or more locations to post ""on the menu listing the item for sale, the number of calories contained in the standard menu item,” as Vox’s Sarah Kliff reported. Another section in the law mandated vending machines ""provide a sign in close proximity to each article of food or the selection button that includes a clear and conspicuous statement disclosing the number of calories contained in the article.""  The hope was that these regulations would help people calculate how many calories they were eating, and maybe have an impact on obesity.  “Big Pizza” and other food lobby groups tried to fight menu labeling. Then the FDA’s commissioner said he’d get the job done.  The Food and Drug Administration, one of the agencies that regulates the food industry, was in charge of finalizing and implementing menu labeling. But the Obamacare mandates, even under President Barack Obama, were beset by delays because of intense lobbying from various factions of the food industry.  American pizza makers have pushed for, among other things, only posting calories for serving sizes they determine, instead of the actual serving sizes people are going to eat. Convenience stores and supermarkets argued menu labeling, while appropriate for restaurants, would be too expensive and burdensome for them. Movie theaters, for their part, tried to keep their 1,000-calorie popcorns out of the calorie postings.  Finally, in November 2017, the FDA released draft guidance about how the industry would have to comply with the menu labeling by May 2018. Health advocates said they were pleased to see the rule was left mostly intact, which came as a surprise since the Trump administration had pushed back the implementation of the rule just before it was supposed to go into effect a year ago, last May.  The FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has repeatedly pledged his personal interest in nutrition, and his desire to go ahead with menu labeling, which he doesn’t view as a left or right issue, as Politico’s Helena Bottemiller Evich reported. “I’m quite sure that a lot of conservatives, including myself, have turned over packages in stores to look at the calorie information and the nutrition information and appreciate that that information is there,” he told Politico.  For that reason, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which had sued the FDA over menu labeling delays, put their lawsuit on hold in September.  And Gottlieb kept his word. In a May 2 blog post, he framed the regulation as a win for consumers and a way to enhance competition among food producers to create products that are “healthy, inexpensive ... [and] also tasteful.”  “I’ve working on menu labeling for 15 years, and am thrilled that at long last, people will be able make up their own mind about how many calories they want to eat at chain restaurants,” said Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. “Menu labeling allows people an easy way to cut hundreds of calories or more with simple, split-second decisions.”  The law could have a far-reaching impact, and not just on the food choices individuals make  To date, the evidence on calorie labeling’s impact on health is somewhat mixed. The studies and meta-analyses either suggest that calorie labeling has had little influence over people's food choices or that the available studies are too poorly designed to really tell. A newer Cochrane Review also concluded that the quality of the available evidence is low — leading to uncertainty about menu labeling’s effects — but noted that studies carried out in real-world settings suggest labeling could reduce calorie intake by about 50 calories per meal (or 8 percent of a 600 calorie meal).  Researchers have also found that people who are already calorie-conscious do pay attention to labels, but those who aren't don't. In other words, just having that information displayed doesn't intrinsically change people's behaviors. So health wonks don’t expect most people will immediately start making healthier food choices when menu labels come out.  There’s also the question of whether menu labels are accurate: one study investigated and found that posted calorie counts generally hit the mark, but there was some variation. Nearly 20 percent of foods tested had 100 more calories per serving than the labels stated.  Even so, calorie labeling’s biggest impacts are expected to have little to do with the one-off choices we make at the ordering counter: they could push food companies and restaurants to reformulate products so that they aren’t so hideously high in calories, and shift consumer attitudes about nutrition.  Researchers have found that after menu labeling was implemented in Seattle in 2009, food purveyors tweaked their recipes and lowered calories, for example.  Menu labeling also prompts people to talk about calories — raising awareness about nutrition, as this Health Affairs study pointed out:  For example, a recent article in the New York Times showed that the typical order at Chipotle contains about 1,070 calories—twice as many calories as a Big Mac and “more than half of the calories that most adults are supposed to eat in an entire day.”  Harvard Medical School researcher Jason Block, who has been studying calorie labeling, draws a comparison to how smoking behaviors have evolved over time. “The story about tobacco policies and how smoking patterns have changed is as much a story about changing social norms as it is about specific policies. This widespread implementation of a public education campaign like calorie labeling should change the public’s consciousness about calories.”  We know from the soda tax debate that it’s been hard to disentangle what impact the taxes are having from the awareness the tax debate raised about the health impact of soda. The same may be true about calorie labeling — so perhaps that means that all the discussion about this Obama-era mandate, and the years of news articles about delays in the press, are already having an effect.",3.5,2,"[4.0, 3.0]"
1591,3296,11,10,2017,2017-11-10,The New York Times,What’s at Stake in the Bonn Climate Talks?,"In 2018, leaders plan to assess their efforts to date and discuss what further action could help lessen the odds of drastic global warming — with the goal of crafting newer, stronger national pledges by 2020. But before they can do any of that, they need to agree to formal ground rules for that exercise. That “rule book” will be a focus at Bonn.  How do countries plan to make progress on climate change?  One widely recognized problem with the current Paris pledges is that they’re fairly vague.  China promised that its emissions would peak around 2030, but the country’s energy data is notoriously murky, so it’s hard to tell how much progress it’s actually making. Similarly, the European Union vowed to cut emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, but offered few specifics on how to achieve that goal — making it hard to gauge whether European policymakers could realistically be doing much more.  At Bonn, negotiators will be discussing how to make these pledges more rigorous and transparent, so that countries can more readily be held accountable for their actions. That means tackling questions like: What’s the best way to track nations’ progress, to see if they’re doing what they said they would do? Is there a way to tell if a country’s pledge could be made more ambitious? Which specific policies are working well and which aren’t?  Because the Paris pledges are largely voluntary — world leaders would have never agreed to a deal otherwise — no one can force governments to take additional action. But, the idea goes, if pledges and policies are made more transparent, world leaders will be better able to pressure and help each other to do more.  The final draft of this “rule book” is not due until next year, and it may not actually get finished at Bonn, but negotiators are hoping to make significant progress on a long list of items at these talks. As always, diplomacy tends to proceed fitfully.  What role will the U.S. play?  Even though the Trump administration has vowed to withdraw from the Paris agreement, the United States can’t formally exit the climate talks until 2020. So the State Department is sending a small team of negotiators to discuss some of the details of the pact.",2.75,2,"[4.0, 1.5]"
1527,3195,11,9,2017,2017-11-09,Fox News,Marissa Mayer says she doesn't know how Yahoo got hacked,"Former Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer admitted on Capitol Hill Wednesday that the Silicon Valley giant still doesn’t understand how hackers managed to compromise the information of billions of Yahoo users.  In an opening statement to the Senate Commerce Committee, Mayer apologized to Yahoo’s users, blamed “Russian agents” for the breach and said that Yahoo quickly worked to protect user accounts and contact law enforcement.  The digital diva — who left the helm of Yahoo earlier this year after it was acquired by Verizon — was forced to testify with a subpoena after she refused several requests to testify voluntarily, according to a Tuesday report. A Mayer spokesperson said Tuesday she was appearing voluntarily.  “As CEO, these thefts occurred during my tenure, and I want to sincerely apologize to each and every one of our users,” Mayer told the Senate Commerce Committee, testifying alongside the interim and former CEOs of Equifax and a senior Verizon Communication executive.  “Unfortunately, while all our measures helped Yahoo successfully defend against the barrage of attacks by both private and state-sponsored hackers, Russian agents intruded on our systems and stole our users’ data.”  Nevertheless, Yahoo still does not fully understand “how the act was perpetrated,” Mayer admitted.  Mayer noted that after Yahoo discovered the first hacks in late 2016, Yahoo required all of its users to change their passwords if they hadn’t, and scrapped old security questions.  Verizon acquired most of Yahoo’s assets in June, the same month Mayer stepped down. Verizon disclosed last month that a 2013 Yahoo data breach affected all 3 billion of its accounts, compared with an estimate of more than 1 billion disclosed in December.  In March, federal prosecutors charged two Russian intelligence agents and two hackers with masterminding the 2014 theft of 500 million Yahoo accounts, the first time the US government has criminally charged Russian spies for cyber crimes.  The cyber thieves — identified by Mayer as Russian intelligence officers and state-sponsored actors — did not get their hands on “passwords in clear text, payment card data, or bank account information,” Yahoo said at the time.  Mayer testified along with interim Equifax CEO Paulino do Rego Barros Jr. and former Equifax CEO Richard Smith, as well as Verizon’s chief privacy officer Karen Zacharia and Entrust Datacard CEO Todd Wilkinson.  In September, Equifax revealed that hackers had stolen the personal information of over 140 million US consumers from its website.

1543,3211,11,9,2017,2017-11-09,Fox News,Mexican citizen executed in Texas for decades-old killing vows he ‘will be back for justice’,"The Mexican citizen executed Wednesday night for killing his 16-year-old cousin wrote in a handwritten statement that he will be back for justice, ""You can count on that!""  Ruben Ramirez Cardenas, 47, was given a lethal injection after several federal court appeals failed to halt his punishment for the February 1997 killing of Mayra Laguna, 16. She was abducted from her family's apartment and beaten to death.  Asked by the warden to make a final statement, he replied, ""No, sir.""  As the lethal dose of pentobarbital began, he took a couple of breaths and then began snoring. After less than a minute, all movement stopped.  Twenty-one minutes later, at 10:26 p.m. CST, he was pronounced dead, making him the seventh convicted killer put to death this year in Texas, which carries out capital punishment more than any other state.  In a handwritten statement released afterward, Cardenas thanked his family, attorneys and the Mexican consulate for their help.  His punishment was delayed for about four hours as last-ditch appeals for the former security guard focused primarily on efforts to have trial evidence undergo new DNA testing. In a filing to the U.S. Supreme Court hours before his execution, lawyers argued Texas was violating Cardenas' due process rights and a state statute that covers forensic testing. They asked the justices to halt the execution for a court review.  They also asked the justices for more time to appeal a lower court's rejection of a federal civil rights lawsuit in which they claimed his due process and civil rights were being violated because Texas officials wouldn't release evidence so it can undergo new DNA testing.  Attorneys for the state said the lawsuit was improper and that state courts already refused the DNA request because Cardenas could not show that more advanced tests would exonerate him. DNA results in evidence at Cardenas' trial were not false, state attorneys said.  The high court, without comment, rejected both appeals.  Earlier this week, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the state's highest criminal court, rejected a similar appeal seeking DNA tests. Cardenas' attorneys argued the new testing would be better than the now-obsolete testing that left ""persistent doubts about his guilt and the integrity of his conviction.""  Laguna was snatched from a bedroom she shared with a younger sister at her family's public housing apartment in McAllen in South Texas. In a confession to police, Cardenas said he and a friend drove around with the high school student in his mother's car. He said he had sex with the teen and then punched her as she fought him after he unbound her arms to let her go.  ""I didn't plan on doing this, but I was high on cocaine,"" he told authorities.  He said after he hit the teen in the neck, she began coughing up blood and having difficulty breathing. After trying unsuccessfully to revive her, he said he tied her up ""and rolled her down a canal bank.""  Her body was found in a canal near a lake in the Rio Grande Valley in far South Texas. It’s what happened next that has Mexican officials and human rights groups arguing he shouldn’t be put to death.  Cardenas' defense team, funded by the Mexican government, claims the United States violated an international treaty by denying Cardenas the opportunity to speak to his country’s consulate after his arrest.  “It’s a significant treaty violation,” Gregory Kuykendall, an Arizona attorney authorized to speak on behalf of Mexico, told the Houston Chronicle.  If Texas officials execute Cardenas, they would be in apparent violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.  In 2004, the U.N.’s international court in the Hague ruled that the U.S. must review cases similar to Cardenas’. Then-President George W. Bush told states to comply but the Supreme Court overruled him and said it was up to Congress – not the president – to order states to obey.  Since then, Congress has dragged its feet.  “The result: an illegal loophole states are exploiting to execute foreign nationals in violation of international law,” the ACLU says.  Laguna's sister, Roxana Jones, said she had waited 21 years for justice to be served.  ""Words can't begin describe the relief it feels to know that there is true peace after so much pain and sorrow,"" she said in a statement.  Cardenas' attorney, Maurie Levin, contended eyewitness testimony against Cardenas was shaky, that little physical evidence tied him to the killing and that his confession was obtained after 22 hours of isolation and intense police questioning.  She also said that authorities acted improperly when not telling the Mexican-born Cardenas that he could get legal help from the Mexican consulate.  Cardenas grew up in the Texas Rio Grande Valley.  The friend who was with Cardenas during the abduction, Jose Antonio Lopez Castillo, now 45, was convicted of aggravated kidnapping and is serving a 25-year prison term.

Bannon declared at a Macomb County, Michigan GOP Unity dinner on Wednesday that President Donald Trump won Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania because Trump understood the plight of the American Midwest and the middle-class.  Bannon told the Macomb County Republican audience that then-candidate Donald Trump was the finest candidate since Ronald Reagan and that Trump understood how globalism hollowed out America’s manufacturing base in the Midwest. Bannon said:  Let’s go back let’s go back in time in August 85 days before, Donald J. Trump, when I joined the campaign I think was August 13th or 14th. I think it was 12 – 16 points down basically double digits down at every battleground state. For every significant battleground state, I think was 70 on the generic ballot you got to be 99 of every 10 registered Republicans have to vote for you to be President I states. I think was like at 70, campaign didn’t have a lot of cash, not a lot of organization, but what we had was I thought the finest candidate to run for the presidency since Ronald Reagan. And just like Ronald Reagan he understood at a very deep level the problems of this country; he understood why Macomb County and certain areas of Michigan have gone from a global powerhouse in manufacturing to hollowed out. Donald Trump understood what globalization and the elites in this country—in other countries had done to working men and women in the United States and so all I told him I said look it’s very simple we’re just going to compare and contrast Hillary Clinton, who is the Guardian or the standard bearer the Tribune of a corrupt and incompetent elite with yourself who’s an agent of change.  President Donald Trump swept the 2016 presidential election winning 304 electoral votes to Hillary Clinton’s 227 votes by winning Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.  By contrast, Bannon argued that Hillary stood for the status quo in America, which continues to destroy the country’s economy, culture, and military. Bannon explained:  I told candidate Trump at the time on that Saturday and then again on Sunday the 13th to the 14th he had 100% certitude to win if he just stuck with the playbook and that playbook was basically give people permission to vote for you as an agent of change. I said Hillary Clinton stands for exactly the way things are and folks in this country understand that the country is being destroyed economically, culturally, militarily and things can’t go on like this.  The former White House chief strategist suggested that Trump’s simple message of ending mass illegal immigration, curbing legal immigration, bringing back manufacturing jobs, and focusing on an America First foreign policy resonated with America’s working class.  Bannon said, “Now how did Donald Trump do that? He had just gotten very focused on what the message was of a handful of things, number one stop mass illegal immigration and start to deal with legal immigration to get our sovereignty back. Number two, bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States. And number three, we have to bring an end to these pointless foreign wars.”  Bannon added, “People in this country are worried about their children and their grandchildren. They’re worried about where the factories went, who sent them there, and who made money off sending them there? They want to get focused on the problems in this country, not makeup problems.”  Bannon suggested that during the 2016 presidential campaign, they could see Donald Trump’s nationalist-populist rhetoric reaching America’s middle class across Pennsylvania and Michigan. The Breitbart News executive chairman then said that Trump connects with the average American in a way that Hillary could not.  Bannon contended:  We could look at the demographics and we look at what was happening around places like Youngstown, Ohio in Dubuque, Iowa. Our plan was, if we could see it coming back to us, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota and we could feel it coming back to us, we could feel it coming back to us. No president could have put that no candidate could have put that that group of states together and here’s the reason he speaks not just in a vernacular and connects to people he talks to folks like an adult about the most important issues of the day because he’s not a politician. It’s the reason I wanted to come here tonight, to have a partner’s conversation with y’all about exactly where we stand. The only time I ever doubted was that on Election Day we finished in fact we finished in in Michigan, right? I’m not even sure Hillary Clinton—I think she went to Detroit one time I’m not sure.  Bannon concluded, “For too long we’ve allowed the geniuses on Wall Street, in Silicon Valley, in Washington, D.C. to dictate to the working men and women in this country, what’s right and what’s wrong, what’s good and what’s bad, and we’ve had now over 40 years of an ascending economy with technology in Silicon Valley, in Wall Street, in Hollywood, in the imperial capital of Washington, D.C.

The drugmaker AbbVie has won multiple approvals for rare-disease uses for Humira, the world’s best-selling drug, ranging from a form of juvenile arthritis to an eye disease, uveitis. Many new cancer approvals also receive orphan-drug designation because they are targeted at a narrow slice of the population.  With the coveted exclusivity granted by their orphan-drug status, companies can charge virtually anything they want for these products, and some manufacturers have set astronomical prices for drugs that have gone on to bring in billions in sales. Soliris, made by Alexion, racked up more than $2.8 billion in sales in 2016 even though it is only approved to treat three rare diseases.  In May, three Republican senators, including Senator Hatch, asked the Government Accountability Office to look into possible abuses of the Orphan Drug Act, prompted by an investigation by Kaiser Health News. Mr. Melmeyer said he did not think the request showed a change of heart by Senator Hatch, who is chairman of the Finance Committee that may release its tax plan as early as Thursday.  “We’re very much counting on him to step up and be the champion on this,” Mr. Melmeyer said.  In 2015, a report commissioned by the biotechnology trade group and NORD estimated that if the tax credit were removed, the number of drugs approved over the next decade would decline by 33 percent.  Eric Davis, the executive vice president and general counsel of BioMarin Pharmaceutical, which develops what it describes as “ultrarare” drugs, said the tax credit “is really critical to helping us get over the hump with our investment decisions, and I think that’s true for a lot of companies in our space.”  Philip English, a former Republican Congressman who now lobbies for drug firms, said he believed that his clients were picking up support from Republicans and said he was confident that the tax credit would survive any Senate plan.  “I think there is a consensus within the industry and within the advocacy community that the orphan drug credit has been immensely successful in generating innovative investment that has produced a string of successes,” Mr. English said.",4.0,3,"[3.5, 4.0, 4.5]"

The United States has a delegation at international climate talks in Bonn that will be telling other nations what they should do on an agreement that the president wants no part of.  President Donald Trump has promised to withdraw the U.S. from the 2015 Paris climate pact where nations set their own goals to reduce the emissions of heat-trapping gases, but because of legal technicalities America can’t get out until November of 2020.  “It’s like having a guest at a dinner party who complains about the food but stays anyway,” said Nigel Purvis, who worked climate issues in the State Department for Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush — and dealt with a similar situation.  In 2001 Purvis was a climate negotiator for the U.S. State Department when the new president, George W. Bush, had pulled out of a landmark global warming agreement the previous administration had championed.  The U.S. position is not just awkward, it’s potentially bad for the environment, scientists say.  Most of the Bonn meeting will be coming up with rules on how countries report emissions of heat-trapping gases and how transparent they are. The United States used to be the leading force in pushing for tougher rules and more openness, Purvis and other experts said. The rules probably won’t be as strong now, Purvis said.  “If it’s left to Chinese leadership, which is what’s left, you will have less transparency,” said Massachusetts Institute of Technology management professor Henry Jacoby, who co-founded the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change.  The United States government is becoming increasingly isolated on climate change. On Tuesday, the Syrian government, mired in war and the last United Nations country not to sign the Paris accord, announced it would sign the pact. That means the United States will be alone when it pulls out.  State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert responded to the Syrian decision by attacking its government. “If the government of Syria cared so much about what was put in the air, then it wouldn’t be gassing its own people,” she said.  In a not-so subtle jab at Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron plans a separate “One Planet Summit” in Paris to push his “Make Our Planet Great Again” agenda on Dec. 12, the anniversary date of the climate accord. He invited more than 100 world leaders to his event, but not Trump. Instead, he invited lower level U.S. diplomats.  “The rest of the world needs to get on and negotiate ... and treat the U.S. as more of an observer in the process and the U.S. should act that way,” said Greenpeace International Director Jennifer Morgan, who has been at these negotiations for more than 20 years.  That’s not what the U.S. plans.  As meetings started on Monday, U.S. negotiator Trigg Talley said, “The president has made clear that we will engage countries on energy and climate change related issues and we look forward to working with colleagues and partners to advance the work here over these two weeks and beyond.”  The administration is hosting a panel on “the clean and efficient use of fossil fuels and nuclear power,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah said Tuesday. “It is undeniable that fossil fuels will be used for the foreseeable future, and it is in everyone’s interest that they be efficient and clean.”  Of the major fossil fuels, coal is by far the biggest climate change culprit. In 2014, coal accounted for 46 percent of the globe’s carbon dioxide emissions, but was only 29 percent of its energy supply, according to the International Energy Agency.  Three U.S. governors, some mayors, corporate leaders and students will also be attending the Bonn talks.  “We have one major major player who is on the sidelines,” California Gov. Jerry Brown told The Associated Press. “The rest of us will do everything we can to keep advancing efforts and keep doing what is needed to reduce carbon emissions. There is no time to wait.”  Former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg announced Thursday he will spend $50 million to help non-United States countries move away from coal. Bloomberg, Brown and others on Saturday will unveil a report called “America’s Pledge” on how much the United States can do without the federal government.  At a “We’re Still In” event Thursday at the climate talks, James Brainard, mayor Carmel, Indiana, joined in criticizing the Trump climate policy, saying the U.S. will cut emissions regardless of the president.  “He talks about greatness a lot,” Brainard said. “Great countries keep their word when they sign agreements. Great countries care about the condition of the planet they are going to hand off to their children and grandchildren.”  If the U.S. remains out of the Paris accord and tries to dismantle President Obama’s initiatives to curb emissions, the Earth will warm by an additional one or two tenths of a degree, said Glen Peters, a Norwegian scientist who is part of the Global Carbon Project.  Scientists say that even a few tenths of a degree of warming can have dramatic impacts on ecosystems and even day-to-day life for people.

Tim Kaine, D-Va., Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., speak informally on tax reform and the elections with reporters in the Senate Press Gallery at the Capitol in Washington. It’s an article of faith among Republicans that the GOP’s electoral fortunes next year hinge on whether they succeed in their longstanding dream to redraft the nation’s complex, inefficient tax code. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)  WASHINGTON (AP) — It’s an article of faith among Republicans — reinforced by the party’s drubbing in this week’s off-year elections in Virginia and New Jersey — that the GOP’s electoral fortunes next year hinge on whether they succeed in their longstanding dream to redraft the nation’s complex, inefficient tax code.  Without a win on tax reform, the argument goes, Republicans are sunk in next year’s midterm elections. Core Republican voters and donors would lose faith. GOP lawmakers would have few accomplishments to run on.  “One of the things you do have to do is pass the things that you ran on,” said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., former chair of the campaign committee for House Republicans. “The other side is already whipped up. There’s nothing you can do about that. But your own side loses faith and you get a depressed turnout. If you don’t get them done, you’re guaranteed a bad midterm.”  The head of the Republican National Committee, Ronna Romney McDaniel, said GOP voters are looking to see what Congress can achieve.  “I can’t say that’s going to be the make-or-break of 2018,” she said, adding that Republicans are “facing headwinds in the coming midterms.”  “I think it’s important that we get this done,” she added.  Democrats agree that failure on tax reform would be a political disaster for Republicans. But passing the coveted tax measure wouldn’t necessarily save them from a bad midterm. The downside risk of failure, both sides say, far exceeds the upside reward.  “Without tax reform I think we’re in the minority,” said Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho. “But that doesn’t mean it’ll save us by any stretch of the imagination. I think yesterday kind of demonstrated that.”  The pending House bill, little understood by the public, performs poorly in public opinion polls. Voters are generally unenthusiastic about tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy and are skeptical that they’ll see a tax cut.  An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll taken last month found that people by large margins believe the Trump-backed tax plan helps wealthy people and corporations. Just over four in 10 in the poll said they believe that it helps middle-income individuals and families, slightly more than the number who thinks it hurts them.  Losing Virginia GOP gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie ran on a promise of across-the-board tax cuts that failed to catch on.  “We had an experiment on tax cut politics in Virginia through Ed Gillespie’s campaign. And the tax cut gambit really fell flat,” said Geoff Garin of Hart Research, lead pollster for the campaign of the Democratic governor-elect, Ralph Northam. “If the Republicans think somehow that tax cut politics will heal their problems of having to run with Donald Trump and all the damage they’ve already done to themselves on health care, the laboratory experiment we had in Virginia yesterday makes it very clear that that will not happen for them.”  The tax measure, at least as currently drafted by House Republicans, would impose tax increases on many of the affluent suburban voters who just turned against Republicans not only in Virginia, but in New Jersey and New York’s Westchester and Nassau Counties. The measure would repeal a number of deductions cherished by upper middle-income taxpayers, including the state income tax deduction, while limiting the deductibility of mortgage interest on home loans exceeding $500,000.  “Look, it’s a lose-lose for them,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. “I think even if they pass the bill, as people learn all the things that are taken away it’s going to hurt them. But I think if they can’t pass a bill their ability to get things done is questioned, even by the deep Trump supporters. So it’s a lose-lose.”  Schumer has been urging Republicans to follow the model of the successful 1986 tax reform bill, in which former President Ronald Reagan worked with both Democrats and Republicans to gore special interest provisions while lowering tax rates.  Two weeks after Reagan signed the bill, however, Republicans suffered a drubbing in the 1986 midterms, losing control of the Senate with an eight-seat loss.  In the aftermath of Tuesday’s drubbing, Republicans sought to portray an air of calm, cautioning against reading too much into the results in two states — Virginia and New Jersey — that went for Democrat Hillary Clinton in last year’s election. They said that passage of their tax overhaul bill would pay off.  “I think that’s going to bear fruit politically, but most importantly it’s going to help people,” said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., at a Wednesday morning event held by The Washington Examiner. “If anything, this just puts more pressure on making sure we follow through.”  Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said of Virginia: “I see it as a blue state staying blue.”  ___  Associated Press writer Tom Beaumont in Des Moines, Iowa, contributed to this report.",2.8333333333333335,6,"[0.5, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.5]"

(AP Photo/Minh Hoang)  DANANG, Vietnam (AP) — President Donald Trump is just one of 21 leaders attending the annual Pacific Rim summit that begins Friday in the scenic coastal city of Danang, Vietnam.  Trump’s withdrawal from a regional trade pact and his preference for country-to-country deals are at odds with the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum’s longstanding mission to fight protectionism. But the group will strive to find ways to demonstrate unity on some important issues, including concerns over North Korea’s nuclear program.  TRADE  As a regional economic forum, the 21-member APEC works from the grassroots level up to promote trade and investment across the region. The U.S. withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership was a setback for the regional effort to create a framework for an eventual regional free trade area. But the remaining 11 TPP members are working toward a new deal that can move ahead without the U.S., while other regional trade deals are also under negotiation. On trade, Trump may find himself sidelined as other leaders push ahead with their multi-country talks on opening markets.  ___  NORTH KOREA  Trump arrives straight from Beijing, where he was lobbying North Korea’s chief trading partner and source of aid and diplomatic support to take more forceful measures against Pyongyang.  North Korea’s nuclear program is seen as a threat to regional security and stability, the underpinnings of the region’s fast growth and growing affluence. The APEC leaders will likely share agreement on the need for a strong statement in support of diplomatic dialogue while urging Pyongyang to cease provocative actions like testing ballistic missiles.  China argues that sanctions alone cannot solve the impasse, and has urged Washington to cool its rhetoric and open a dialogue with North Korea. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters last month that Washington has lines of communication to Pyongyang. North Korea is not an APEC member.  ___  SOUTH CHINA SEA  In past years, the cordial atmosphere of the mostly economic-oriented APEC summits has been strained at times by tensions between China and the U.S. over Beijing’s military buildup, island-building and assertive claims to disputed islands in the South China Sea.  China says the U.S. has no territorial claim in those waters and should let countries in the region manage their own disputes.  Washington remains critical of such moves, saying it has a national interest in freedom of navigation in sea lanes critical for world trade. Tillerson said last month that China’s “provocative actions” in the waters are a challenge to international law and norms.  APEC summits generally tend to skate around this issue.  ___  REALMS OF INFLUENCE  As the largest economies in APEC, the U.S., China and Japan tend to exert significant influence over the forum’s agenda and activities. It’s unclear if Trump will seek a strong leadership role at the summit, where talks on the sidelines tend to make more news than the event itself.  APEC’s decisions are by consensus and are non-binding. The forum serves mainly as a way to help integrate the disparate economies that span the vast Pacific Rim, from wealthy Japan, Canada and the U.S. to developing countries like Vietnam, the Philippines and Papua New Guinea.",4.5,1,[4.5]

(David B. Hollingsworth/The Virginian-Pilot via AP)  Sweeping Democratic victories in Virginia and key gains in other 2017 state legislative races have lifted Democratic hopes of even bigger wins in next year’s midterm elections, as they seek a greater voice in how political districts will be redrawn for the decade to come.  Democrats won the governors’ offices in Virginia and New Jersey on Tuesday, erased a previously dominant Republican majority in the Virginia House of Delegates and won a special election that gave them control of the Washington state Senate.  All told, Democrats flipped about two dozen state legislative seats around the country Tuesday and have now gained at least 30 seats previously held by Republicans since President Donald Trump won election last year, reversing several years of Republican momentum.  “In general, this is a rebuke of Republican governance of states,” said Jessica Post, executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. She added: “The other thing it said is we can win all across the country.”  The fight for control of legislative chambers matters not only for policies on health care, taxes and education, but also because the legislature in most states determines how future congressional and state legislative districts are drawn. The next round of redistricting will take place after the 2020 Census, and both parties are focused on controlling as many states as possible by then.  Republicans swept to power in many states in the 2010 elections, just in time to use their new authority during the last round of redistricting. Since then, Republicans have gained more than 900 state legislative seats nationwide.  This year’s Democratic victories are “a very small step forward” by comparison and have largely come in “seats, that by all rights, they probably should have had already,” said Matt Walter, president of the Republican State Leadership Committee.  Heading into Tuesday’s elections, Republicans controlled more than two-thirds of all state legislative chambers, including full control of both chambers and the governor’s office in about two dozen states. By comparison, Democrats had complete control in only a half-dozen states. Just five states had legislatures where each party controlled one chamber, and several of those involved bipartisan coalitions.  During the past year, Democrats have launched a coordinated effort to chip away at Republican dominance from lower-level offices on up. It’s been aided by the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, which is chaired by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder.  Democratic Party leaders pointed to Tuesday’s results as the fruits of their revamped strategy.  Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez told reporters on a conference call that 33 groups worked in Virginia to help elect Democrats, doubling the number of voter contacts from four years ago. Various Democratic entities poured millions of dollars into races there and elsewhere.  Democrat Ralph Northam won the Virginia governor’s race, and Democrats whittled the Republicans’ 66-34 House majority down to a near even split with several races still too close to call. Most of the Democrats’ gains came in districts that had voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton over Trump in last year’s elections.  The Democratic legislative candidates were aided by a large voter turnout in the governor’s race. Anti-Trump sentiment motivated lot of voters who previously didn’t take an interest in governor’s races, Republican consultant Chris Jankowski, an architect of the GOP’s 2010 REDMAP redistricting project, told attendees Wednesday at a Harvard University redistricting conference.  Democrats would have won even more Virginia House seats had the districts not been gerrymandered so heavily in favor of Republicans, said Kelly Ward, executive director of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee.  “It shouldn’t take tsunami-level elections in order to maybe tie — maybe — in the House of Delegates,” Ward said at the Harvard conference.  Nonetheless, Democrats say the large swing in Virginia shows it’s possible for them to flip other chambers next year, including the Colorado Senate, Michigan House and both chambers of the Minnesota Legislature.  Democrat Phil Murphy’s victory in Tuesday’s race for New Jersey governor, replacing termed-out Republican Gov. Chris Christie, means Democrats will hold the trifecta of the chief executive office and both legislative chambers, where they picked up even more seats Tuesday.  Democrats also regained control of both houses of the Washington state Legislature, when Manka Dhingra won a special election that flipped the balance of power in the state Senate. More than $8.7 million was spent on the race, including about $5.9 million by third-party groups. That made it the most expensive legislative contest in the state’s history.  In special elections in Georgia, Democrats claimed three seats previously held by Republicans — all three in suburban areas.  GOP strategist Chip Lake, a Georgia-based political consultant, said Republicans “are hemorrhaging college-educated voters in the suburbs” but added that Democrats also face hurdles revealed by their 2016 losses and should be careful about celebrating too much.  For Republicans to bounce back nationally, it will be crucial for the GOP-led Congress to pass a tax overhaul and address problems surrounding health care, he said.  “Absent that, what we saw yesterday could be a precursor of what happens in 2018,” Lake said.  ___  Follow David A.

1582,3269,11,9,2017,2017-11-09,Associated Press News,"US and them: America, the elephant in room at climate talks","US and them: America, the elephant in room at climate talks  WASHINGTON (AP) — How’s this for awkward? The United States has a delegation at international climate talks in Bonn that will be telling other nations what they should do on an agreement that the president wants no part of.  President Donald Trump has promised to withdraw the U.S. from the 2015 Paris climate pact where nations set their own goals to reduce the emissions of heat-trapping gases, but because of legal technicalities America can’t get out until November of 2020.  “It’s like having a guest at a dinner party who complains about the food but stays anyway,” said Nigel Purvis, who worked climate issues in the State Department for Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush — and dealt with a similar situation.  In 2001 Purvis was a climate negotiator for the U.S. State Department when the new president, George W. Bush, had pulled out of a landmark global warming agreement the previous administration had championed.  The U.S. position is not just awkward, it’s potentially bad for the environment, scientists say.  Most of the Bonn meeting will be coming up with rules on how countries report emissions of heat-trapping gases and how transparent they are. The United States used to be the leading force in pushing for tougher rules and more openness, Purvis and other experts said. The rules probably won’t be as strong now, Purvis said.  “If it’s left to Chinese leadership, which is what’s left, you will have less transparency,” said Massachusetts Institute of Technology management professor Henry Jacoby, who co-founded the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change.  The United States government is becoming increasingly isolated on climate change. On Tuesday, the Syrian government, mired in war and the last United Nations country not to sign the Paris accord, announced it would sign the pact. That means the United States will be alone when it pulls out.  State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert responded to the Syrian decision by attacking its government. “If the government of Syria cared so much about what was put in the air, then it wouldn’t be gassing its own people,” she said.

It is also better positioned. President Trump has spoken favorably of letting veterans choose. The group’s former executive director was considered to be Veterans Affairs secretary. Another senior adviser was given a top position there before moving over to the White House. And Marc Short, the White House’s legislative director, is a former top Koch lieutenant.  The latest push was a natural fit to activate other Koch groups, including Americans for Prosperity and Freedom Partners, according to a representative of the network, who asked for anonymity to discuss the group’s plans. The network plans to spend liberally from its $300 million to $400 million policy and politics budget for the year, financing outreach to activists, lobbying and direct advertising.  Other allied groups, including Grover Norquist’s Americans for Tax Reform and Tea Party Nation, have come along, signing a letter to lawmakers late last month amplifying many of Concerned Veterans’ long-running arguments.  That campaign has disturbed many of the old-line veterans groups, which argue that their privileged place in advising lawmakers is protected for a reason. Concerned Veterans and other advocacy groups working alongside it take directions from wealthy donors, they say, not veterans.  The old-line veterans groups and lawmakers from both parties supported the creation of the Choice program and largely agree that the agency’s health programs need reorganization. The House committee was set to vote on bipartisan legislation on Wednesday that would allow agency doctors to decide with the veteran when it was in a veteran’s best interest to seek private care — because a nearby government facility either was overburdened or could not provide specialty care.  The vote was ultimately postponed over cost concerns.  Republicans and conservative groups would prefer new spending be at least partly offset by cost savings and other cuts to the Department of Veterans Affairs. Democrats and the old-line veterans groups say they are unlikely to support a plan unless it makes simultaneous investments in the agency’s own capacity.

(AP Photo/Adelle Kalakouti)  NAMALU, Uganda (AP) — The sun is setting over Karamoja. Time for the nomadic herders to return their cattle to thorn-ringed enclosures. They’ve roamed since first light, searching for pasture in Uganda’s poorest region where water and grazing land are scarce.  Now the changing climate has brought hunger and bewilderment as traditional coping methods for the harsh environment fail. As the first major global climate conference convenes in Germany since President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. will pull out of the 2015 Paris accord, many in Africa fear they will be hit harder than most.  In Karamoja, as in many rural areas of Africa, cattle are highly valued, a source of prestige and wealth. From a young age, Karamojong men build their herds to be used as dowry for marriage. Now they look to the rainless sky in frustration.  “We have just had to bear with it because we have nowhere to go,” said 62-year-old Mudang Lowal.  In northeastern Uganda, Karamoja’s semi-arid savannah borders Kenya’s Turkana region and South Sudan. The vast region, a tenth of Uganda’s land, has seen rising temperatures for the past 35 years.  Rainfall is poor and unreliable. Long dry spells and flash floods have become more frequent in the past decade.  Historically, the rainy season runs from April to September and the dry season from November to March, creating one harvest per year. But now that pattern has changed, causing crop failures and lower milk production. The Karamojong, who had developed early warning systems for the punishing environment based on wind direction, animal behavior and the flowering of trees, now feel off-balance.  “The seasons are now different,” said Michael Lokwameri, a father of seven children.  As tradition dictates, when changes in nature are noticed, village elders gather at a local shrine to decide on a way forward.  This year, the fruitless tamarind trees tell the elders that the upcoming dry season will not be as severe as last year’s, said elder Max Adjaka during a gathering in his village in Nakapiripirit district.  Last year, more than half of Karamoja’s population, or about 640,000 people, faced food shortages. Many resorted to selling their cattle or begging in the streets. Others ate wild plants.  “It is just desperation of hunger that forces us to eat such things,” said 72-year-old Nakoki Nayep.  The region is already vulnerable after decades of political upheaval. Thirty years of widespread conflict among herders ended when Uganda’s government swept in and forced them to disarm. An estimated 82 percent of the population lives in absolute poverty, compared to the national average of 31 percent. Aid groups such as the World Food Program provided emergency food aid to Karamoja for more than 40 years.  Climate change brings more uncertainty, experts say.  “For the case of Karamoja, the increase or the rise in temperature had been taken for more than 30 years,” said William George Omony, senior meteorologist at the Uganda National Meteorological Authority. He attributed last year’s drought to the global phenomena of El Nino and La Nina, which are increasing in frequency.  Temperatures in the region are set to rise by 0.8 degrees Celsius over the next 20 years and 2.3 degrees Celsius by the end of the century if no measures are taken, the authority says. Rainfall levels also are projected to increase, by 5 percent over the next 20 years and 15 percent by the end of the century.  Despite the growing rainfall, water reserves will be compromised by the rise in temperature and evaporation, Omony said. That will lead to more disease and the disappearance of once-resilient indigenous crops.  The use of drought-resistant crops and tree planting are encouraged to help the population adapt. In Namalu, the German government-backed GIZ development agency trains the Karamojong in sustainable agricultural practices. Learning assistant Caroline Ichomot said many farmers have embraced them.  The reception by the wider community has been mixed, in part because of traditional beliefs. Some pastoralists have resisted, especially after Uganda’s government in recent years prioritized permanent settlements and crop farming. Some critics say cultural identity, including freedom of movement for cattle, must be respected.  The official in charge of programs in Karamoja for the prime minister’s office, Francis Lowoth Okori, stressed the need to abandon handouts and develop sustainable assistance to fight the region’s hunger and poverty.  After last year’s drought, Ugandan officials met with aid groups. “We said, ‘What is the problem?’ And actually, we found the problem is water,” Okori said. The next step is the construction of at least 10 more dams across Karamoja, he said.",3.8333333333333335,3,"[4.0, 3.5, 4.0]"
1577,3264,11,9,2017,2017-11-09,Media Matters,Watch MSNBC's Ali Velshi debunk Republican talking points about tax cuts,"ALI VELSHI (HOST): We've seen it under the Reagan administration, we've seen it in the UK recently. When you lower tax rates on corporations, you don't see any corresponding wage increase in the United States. That's the bottom line. There's just no evidence of that actually happening. So I'll tell you what happens, if you are a company or you’re wealthy in America and you lose the estate tax and you lose the AMT and you get the corporate tax rate reduced from 35 to 20, those are absolute gains. there is no question that’s going to happen if one of these bills passes. But if you're middle class you know you'll get an average $1,200 gain and everything else is a hope. You hope economic growth will hit 3%, you hope the companies will take the savings that they have in taxes and somehow build factories that'll employ more people and not outsource. So you know what I am saying, if you're middle class in America, this is on a wish and prayer. If you're rich, this is a gift.  REP. RODNEY DAVIS (R-IL): I don't think so. As a matter of fact, you and I must have a distinct disagreement on what the American economy and small businesses throughout this country are going to do when we put more money into their pockets and allow them to invest more money in their businesses. They are going to buy more equipment, this manufacturing and --  VELSHI: Why, sir? Why? Congressman, there's no shortage of capital in this country for businesses --  DAVIS: Because I've seen it happen --  VELSHI: Interest rates are as low as they've ever been. Money is everywhere to be had. Companies are not expanding, not because of the shortages of capital or money or tax rates are too high. You know why companies expand? When there's demand. I just don't know where you are going to think this all of a sudden demand is going to pop up when you don't give the people the break, you give the companies the break. Companies have a lot of money.  DAVIS: We believe we are giving -- you look at the individual tax bracket changes that we've put forth and we are focusing completely on the middle income and lower income families. They're going to be able to ensure that their taxable income continues to go down, and that means also a fair, flatter, and simpler tax code to allow them to put more money in their pockets and participate in their local economies and help their Main Street businesses. And I do believe that companies in our Main Streets are going to continue to invest and grow in our communities to be able to help create the jobs that we know are going to be a part of this package once it passes.  VELSHI: I am going to put it on the screen. You won't be able to see it but I'll tell what you it is. This is the Reagan tax cuts when corporate tax rates went from 46% to 34%, wages fell for five straight years by as much as $3,000 adjusting for inflation. There is just no evidence that tax cuts result in higher wages. I'd be happy to study anything you give me that tells me otherwise. I feel like you are working off of talking points, sir.",3.25,2,"[1.5, 5.0]"
1574,3256,11,9,2017,2017-11-09,Fox News,Why CFPB's rule on small dollar loans puts minority communities at risk,"Last month, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) released its final rule on small-dollar loans. The CFPB heralded this rule as a victory for consumers that would protect them from unscrupulous practices. In reality, however, this rule will shutter thousands of small businesses across the country and force millions of small-dollar loan customers to seek out dangerous alternatives. In doing so, the CFPB is putting the small business community at risk.  According to the U.S. Federal Reserve, nearly half of Americans cannot cover an unexpected expense of $400. In many cases, small-dollar lending allows people to weather temporary financial emergency situations such as a car repair or an illness. Sadly, the CFPB’s rule will severely restrict access to small-dollar loans, leaving millions of Americans without safe credit options.  Over one million consumers spoke out against the rule during the comment period, telling very personal stories of how access to small-dollar loans helped them through tough times. It appears the CFPB did not listen to these concerns and willfully ignored these consumers. These consumer concerns echo published academic studies that show the importance of small-dollar loans.  The United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce (USHCC) has long warned the CFPB of the consequences of restricting access to small-dollar credit. The USHCC represents 4.4 million Hispanic-owned businesses, which create jobs and contribute more than $700 billion to the U.S. economy. USHCC members depend on access to capital to thrive, but in many cases traditional banking institutions don’t operate as extensively within minority communities. In fact, the number of small community banks declined by 14 percent between 2010 and 2014. Small-dollar lenders are therefore often one of the only sources of credit available within many communities.  The burdensome requirements in the CFPB’s final rule will simply be too much for most small storefront lenders to bear. The CFPB’s own estimates projected that its rule would reduce small-dollar lending storefronts by 66 percent, and a Charles River Associates analysis found that the rule would increase compliance costs and ultimately force 82 percent of small storefront lenders to close. Even the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) opposes the CFPB’s rule. In October 2016, the SBA warned the CFPB that the Bureau had not fully considered the devastating impact its rulemaking would have on consumers and small businesses across the country and urged the Bureau to go back to the drawing board. The CFPB once again ignored these concerns, much like the concerns of over a million consumers.  When these businesses are forced to close as a result of the Bureau’s rule, it will have a ripple effect across communities nationwide. As consumers are denied access to small dollar loans, they will be forced to look elsewhere for this vital form of credit from unscrupulous illegal and unlicensed lenders. In fact, a recent survey found that three out of four small-dollar loan borrowers have no other options available to them – a truly staggering number of Americans. The Bureau is effectively eliminating a product upon which millions of people depend without addressing the worse alternatives that await them in the absence of a small-dollar community lenders.  I am disappointed, though not surprised, that the CFPB overlooked such serious concerns from within the Hispanic community. I can only hope that the CFPB realizes the harm its rule will cause and work to mitigate its impact. If the CFPB does nothing to address its onerous rule, I truly fear for the well-being of our communities and small businesses, and most importantly the millions of people who will be left without options in their times of greatest need.",2.75,2,"[1.0, 4.5]"
1573,3248,11,9,2017,2017-11-09,Breitbart,Former Facebook President Says Social Media Is ‘Exploiting’ Human Psychology,"Former Napster co-Founder and Facebook President Sean Parker blasted social media in a recent interview for “exploiting” human psychology.  In a recent interview with Axios, former Facebook President Sean Parker discussed the possible negative psychological effects of social media. Parker, the founder and chair of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, spoke at an Axios event at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, where he discussed social media. Parker described himself as “something of a conscientious objector” to social media in general.  Parker discussed the number of people that were against social media when Facebook first started, telling Parker that they’d never join the online world as they valued intimacy and living in the moment. Parker was quite confident that before long they’d be scrolling through a newsfeed like two billion other Facebook users:  When Facebook was getting going, I had these people who would come up to me and they would say, ‘I’m not on social media.’ And I would say, ‘OK. You know, you will be. And then they would say, ‘No, no, no. I value my real-life interactions. I value the moment. I value presence. I value intimacy.’ And I would say, … ‘We’ll get you eventually.’  Parker discussed the possible psychological effects of social media and Facebook in particular, especially for children who are now growing up in a digitally connected age:  I don’t know if I really understood the consequences of what I was saying, because [of] the unintended consequences of a network when it grows to a billion or 2 billion people and … it literally changes your relationship with society, with each other … It probably interferes with productivity in weird ways. God only knows what it’s doing to our children’s brains.  The former Facebook President discussed the company’s initial aim, which was mainly centered around drawing in and building their audience:  The thought process that went into building these applications, Facebook being the first of them, … was all about: ‘How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?’ And that means that we need to sort of give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while, because someone liked or commented on a photo or a post or whatever. And that’s going to get you to contribute more content, and that’s going to get you … more likes and comments.  Parker described Facebook’s appeal as a “social-validation feedback loop” which exploits human psychology to keep users coming back to the app:  It’s a social-validation feedback loop … exactly the kind of thing that a hacker like myself would come up with, because you’re exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology. The inventors, creators — it’s me, it’s Mark [Zuckerberg], it’s Kevin Systrom on Instagram, it’s all of these people — understood this consciously. And we did it anyway.  Parker also briefly discussed how his vast wealth is likely to allow him to live longer than the average person due to advances in medical science:  Because I’m a billionaire, I’m going to have access to better health care so … I’m going to be like 160 and I’m going to be part of this, like, class of immortal overlords. [Laughter] Because, you know the [Warren Buffett] expression about compound interest. … [G]ive us billionaires an extra hundred years and you’ll know what … wealth disparity looks like.

The PowerWatch is the first of its kind utilizing advanced thermoelectric generators to boost power and charge the internal battery. It’s water resistant up to 50 meters (164 ft) so the user doesn’t even have to take it off while showering. Tham says being able to wear the tracker 24-hours a day is a stark difference from all of the other trackers on the market. “It gives you a more holistic picture of what you are doing in your daily life,” says Tham.  Less than a year after surpassing its crowd funding goal and with new backers on board, Matrix began to ship out the first generation of PowerWatch to initial investors. Consumers can expect to see the watch in stores for the holidays.  The basic Powewatch with silicone strap costs $169. One step up is the Black Ops model, for $199, which comes in a sleek black finish and a Milanese strap. The third option is the PowerWatch X for $249 which offers notification, a reinforced bezel and is water resistant up to 200 meters (656 ft).  “Imagine the future you can have AR goggles or AR glasses powered by the heat from your head, hearables and a lot of other devices that possibly could be a nuisance to use today because of battery charging issue,” says Tham. He explains that every industry could benefit from this new and advancing technology of embracing wasted heat. “If you captured all that heat and recycled it in to useful power, you could power another earth,” says Tham.

1579,3266,11,9,2017,2017-11-09,Associated Press News,Pacific trade pact leaders due to meet on new deal," Leaders of the countries participating in a Pacific Rim trade pact abandoned by President Donald Trump have agreed to meet and are expected to endorse a basic agreement on moving ahead without the U.S.  Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said Friday that he was “reasonably confident” the 11 countries remaining in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which include Malaysia, would have a basic agreement.  They are trying to find a way forward without the U.S., the biggest economy and before Trump took office one of its most assertive supporters. Trump has said he prefers country-to-country deals and is seeking to renegotiate several major trade agreements to, as he says, “put America First.”  Najib’s comments to a business conference on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum followed conflicting reports that a basic agreement had been reached in the wee hours Friday.  Najib said officials met until 3 a.m. Friday trying to bridge their differences and produce a statement for the leaders of their countries to endorse.  “I am quite sanguine we will get a deal but of course it has to go through a process of ratification and some side matters have to be worked out, but at least we have managed to salvage some kind of free trade agreement, which is important for the future of APEC,” Najib said.  Vietnamese officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The negotiations are being held in Danang, Vietnam, alongside meetings of the 21-member APEC’s annual summit, where Trump’s markedly different stance from past U.S. leaders was being felt even before his arrival Friday in the coastal resort city.  While most APEC members say they remain committed to their multi-country approach in weaving their economies ever closer together, many acknowledge that open trade is a mixed bag: Not everyone benefits equally.  The U.S. pushback on “free trade,” evidenced in Trump’s “America First” policy, has raised eyebrows in the region after decades of U.S. pressure on opening markets.  While APEC operates by consensus and customarily issues nonbinding statements, TPP commitments would eventually be ratified and enforced by its members.  But even talks this week on a declaration to cap this week’s APEC summit had to be extended for an extra half-day as ministers haggled over wording. It’s unclear what the exact sticking points were, but officials have alluded to differences over the unequal impact more open trade has had on workers and concerns over automation in manufacturing that could leave many millions in a wide array of industries with no work to do.  Vietnamese Trade Minister Tran Tuan Anh said a “new trend of protectionism” was afoot, but the group eventually managed to bridge their differences.  As a developing country with a fast-growing export sector, Vietnam has a strong interest in open trade and access for its exports to consumers in the West. The summit is an occasion for its leaders to showcase the progress its economy has made thanks largely to foreign investment and trade. Danang, Vietnam’s third largest city, is in the midst of a construction boom as dozens of resorts and smaller hotels pop up along its scenic coastline.  But even though its economy grew at a brisk 6.2 percent pace last year, Vietnam’s GDP per capita is still one of the lowest among APEC members at less than $2,200. Many of its 95 million people remain poor and vulnerable to natural disasters such as storms that lashed the coast near Danang just days before the APEC meetings.  APEC’s members are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, the U.S. and Vietnam.",2.0,1,[2.0]

Bill Walker addresses reporters during a news conference in Juneau, Alaska. The state of Alaska will attempt to advance a multibillion dollar natural gas pipeline project with the help of interests from China. Walker said the agreement signed late Wednesday, Nov. 8, 2017, is with Sinopec, China Investment Corp. and the Bank of China. (AP Photo/Becky Bohrer, File)  ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — The latest push in a decades-long effort to commercialize vast stores of Alaska’s natural gas got a boost when the state announced a deal with three Chinese companies. But the $43 billion project is far from reality.  The agreement advances a project to move gas through a pipeline to the Alaska coast, where it would be liquefied and shipped to China and other points in Asia. U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping looked on as Alaska’s governor and representatives from the companies signed the deal Thursday in Beijing.  But the fanfare does not ensure one shovelful of tundra gets overturned. Similar efforts to build a natural gas pipeline have fizzled repeatedly.  Here’s a look at the new project:  WHAT’S THE PLAN?  Alaska’s prodigious North Slope is known for its vast deposit of oil, which fueled construction of the 800-mile trans-Alaska oil pipeline in the 1970s. Since then, oil production has declined, and the recession-racked state hopes to tap into natural gas to fill the gaps.  The North Slope has proven gas reserves over 35 trillion cubic feet, but no way to move it. State efforts to find partners willing to shell out billions for a pipeline have flopped over the years, with major oil companies the latest to step away. Gov. Bill Walker has since courted Asian markets.  Sinopec, the Bank of China and China Investment Corp. signed on, but financial terms have not been released. Walker said 75 percent of the gas would be earmarked for China, and Alaska would keep the rest to sell to other Asian markets. The state would be the majority owner.  Walker said he wants final agreements in place by the end of next year, with groundbreaking in 2019.  The plan includes building a gas treatment plant on the North Slope, a pipeline that would go 800 miles to the town of Nikiski and a liquefaction plant there. Walker anticipates all of it to be running about five years later.  Larry Persily, former U.S. coordinator for Alaska natural gas projects, said it could cost $1 billion to get to that point, and he doesn’t think the timeline is realistic.  “But if the first tanker left the dock in 2025 instead of 2023 or 2026, everyone would still be ecstatic,” he said.  WHY DID OIL COMPANIES BACK OUT?  BP, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips had been working on the pipeline plan but backed away to concentrate on other projects. That left pipeline skeptics wondering, Persily said.  “If companies don’t think this is a good time to put their money into it, why should the state?” he said. “As the governor has explained, the state has an overriding interest in getting this done — companies have other places they can invest their money.”  The Chinese companies also don’t have the same shareholder pressures as U.S firms.  “From what I’ve seen from China, they make decisions like this and they pursue them generally to completion as a matter of strategy and are less worried about some of the short-term economics,” said Mark Barteau, director of the University of Michigan’s Energy Institute.  WHY CHINA?  It has an insatiable need for natural gas as it struggles with pollution and tries to end its reliance on coal.  “They have exhibited a long-term interest in having a large and secure gas supply, and I think this is just perhaps the largest — but by no means the first — step they’ve taken to achieve that,” said Barteau, who also serves on the science advisory board for the National Institute of Clean and Low Carbon Energy in Beijing.  Charlie Riedl, executive director of Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group the Center for Liquefied Natural Gas, sees no reason to be skeptical, saying the Chinese have wanted to get involved in a natural gas project in the U.S. for some time.  The agreement “is a really positive indicator that there is demand, and there is an appetite in Asia for this gas, and the proximity to market being in Alaska is obviously a good thing,” he said.  WHAT ARE THE DOWNSIDES?  Without seeing the details of the agreement, some analysts pointed to the large amount of gas earmarked for China and the possible terms of the deal.  Barteau said he assumes it would guarantee pricing for a set period.  “If gas prices were to go way up, and we’re locked in selling it at bargain basement prices, that wouldn’t be such a good deal down the line,” he said.  Persily said that if Alaska contracts to sell three-quarters of the gas to one nation, it would “be stuck with one big customer that you sink or swim with.”  WHAT DO ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY?  The Center for Biological Survey called the project a “massively terrible idea” and expects legal action if the Trump administration fast-tracks it or skirts permit requirements in environmental laws.  “It is just a massive investment in new fossil fuel infrastructure at a time when we should be rapidly transitioning to clean energy, and it’s just the wrong decision,” said Kristen Monsell, an attorney for the environmental group.  Her concern is not only what extracting the gas from the ground might do to the environment but also increased tanker activity through habitat of the endangered Pacific right whale.  Another environmental group didn’t foresee plans to stall the pipeline, calling it a safer option than opening up part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling, said Lois Epstein with The Wilderness Society.",3.625,4,"[3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 2.5]"
1570,3243,11,9,2017,2017-11-09,The New York Times,"From Brussels to Arkansas, a Tough Week for Monsanto","The European Union’s decision followed years of haggling and delay. Policymakers largely brushed aside the opinions of two of the bloc’s science agencies, which had found that glyphosate was not a carcinogen.  But glyphosate, which accounts for about a quarter of the global market, has been plunged into controversy since the International Agency for Research on Cancer, part of the World Health Organization, declared it a probable carcinogen in 2015. The finding, which has been disputed by a number of other government agencies, has made the weedkiller a magnet for controversy.  Glyphosate is also at the center of a federal case in the United States over claims that it causes cancer, and California has declared it a carcinogen, following in the footsteps of the international cancer agency.  Use of glyphosate has soared in the United States and other parts of the world over the last two decades, after Monsanto introduced crops that were genetically engineered to be resistant to the chemical. That meant key crops like corn, soybeans and cotton could be sprayed with the herbicide after they emerged from the ground. During that time, the presence of glyphosate in human urine increased 500 percent, according to a recent study by the University of California San Diego School of Medicine and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.  Europe, by contrast, has largely shunned genetically modified crops, but glyphosate is still the Continent’s biggest seller. In Britain and Germany, it is used on as much as 40 percent of agricultural land, according to an industry trade group.  But political sentiment in Europe has been turning against Monsanto, the American company that has become the face of the agrochemical industry, even though it is in the process of being acquired by Bayer, a German chemicals giant. The European Parliament voted last month to ban glyphosate, a step that was nonbinding. And in September, the Parliament made Monsanto the first company to be barred from lobbying the chamber.  The science around glyphosate has become a muddle of allegations and counterallegations. Environmental activists have accused national regulators of hewing too closely to Monsanto’s wishes, while the industry has been exasperated that European politicians are overruling their science agencies. The litigation in the United States has only muddied the waters further, with evidence emerging that Monsanto ghostwrote both journalism and academic work, eroding trust in a company that had long been a lightning rod.",3.75,4,"[3.0, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5]"
1569,3242,11,9,2017,2017-11-09,Vox,A new study compared opioids and over-the-counter painkillers in ERs. Opioids didn’t do so well.,"For years, doctors have deployed opioids in emergency room settings as a standard response to severe acute pain. A new study, however, is questioning that practice in some cases.  The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association this month by researchers at Albany Medical College and Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, looked at four alternative approaches to acute pain in an emergency department: three treatments with opioids and one with over-the-counter, non-opioid painkillers. The researchers concluded that “there were no statistically significant or clinically important differences in pain reduction at 2 hours” between the opioid treatments and the non-opioid variant.  In other words, the kind of pain studied — acute shoulder, arm, hip, or leg pain in an emergency room setting — was treated equally well with non-opioids as it was with opioids. That’s promising, given that opioids generally carry greater risks in terms of addiction, misuse, and overdose — as the nation’s opioid epidemic has shown.  Now, the study does not say that opioids have no place in pain care. Andrew Chang, the lead author of the study, told me he’s worried that in the response to the opioid crisis, we may overcorrect and limit opioids too much. “I do also worry that we might be swinging the pendulum too far in the other direction,” he wrote in an email, “and I hope we don’t end up creating arbitrary regulatory restrictions that prevent patients who appropriately need opioids from receiving opioids.”  But his research demonstrates that it may be possible to cut back on the amount of opioids used in at least some acute pain care settings without inflicting harm. As policymakers and health care providers respond to the opioid epidemic, that’s good to know.  What the study found  The study looked at more than 400 patients going to the Montefiore Medical Center in Bronx, New York, for acute extremity pain from bone fractures, dislocated shoulders, sprained ankles, and other injuries or conditions.  The patients were then randomly divided into four groups, with each group getting a different combination of drugs to treat their pain. The non-opioid group got 400 mg of ibuprofen and 1,000 mg of acetaminophen, which are often sold over the counter as Advil and Tylenol, respectively. The opioid groups got 5 mg of oxycodone and 325 mg of acetaminophen, 5 mg of hydrocodone and 300 mg of acetaminophen, or 30 mg of codeine and 300 mg of acetaminophen.  On a scale of zero to 10, the patients in the study reported, on average, an initial pain score of 8.7, with no significant differences between the groups. One and two hours later, they reported their pain scores after getting their assigned medication.  Across all groups, patients’ pain scores fell over the two hours: by 4.3 in the ibuprofen and acetaminophen group, 4.4 in the oxycodone and acetaminophen group, 3.5 in the hydrocodone and acetaminophen group, and 3.9 in the codeine and acetaminophen group. The reductions were statistically equivalent across all four groups.  “Some (not all) physicians reflexively think fractures require opioids, but this study lends evidence that opioids are not always necessary even in the presence of fractures,” Chang told me, cautioning that there are likely exceptions for worse and more complicated injuries.  The study was a randomized clinical trial, which is considered the gold standard for medical research. When I asked Stanford drug policy expert Keith Humphreys, who was not involved in the research, what he thought of it, he said that it was a “[g]ood study in a good journal.”  There were limitations in the study. For one, the findings only apply to this specific emergency room setting and over two hours. The researchers also explicitly excluded chronic conditions, such as sickle cell disease, because they wanted to focus on acute pain. More research will be needed to see not just if the study’s findings can be replicated, but also if they apply to other settings, other conditions, or over greater periods of time.  Another big caveat: Even if future studies produce similar findings, that does not mean that everyone will be able to use non-opioids for acute pain. As Chang told me, “[I]t’s important to recognize that the lack of a difference in our study among the four groups is on average, and that any individual patient might receive better pain relief with a particular analgesic.” In short, just because something might be generally true does not mean it can apply to every single individual.  For example, patients who require more pain relief may benefit from a higher dose of opioids than what was provided in the study. Chang’s study used a fairly high dose of ibuprofen and acetaminophen; anything higher could risk serious health problems, since ibuprofen can be hard on the kidneys, among other side effects. But the doses used in the opioid groups, while common in ER settings, weren’t close to the maximum safe dose, so they could be scaled up with fewer potential health risks than the ibuprofen-acetaminophen combination.  Kidney donors or people with kidney disease would also likely benefit more from the opioids. Any loss in kidney function makes ibuprofen inadvisable, so it might be better for these types of patients to get opioids regardless of what the study found.  And for patients in end-of-life care, it’s possible that opioids are simply better because the risk of addiction is, frankly, not a very big concern for someone who is terminally ill. So it might be better to use what can be more easily scaled up to higher doses.  Other caveats may apply, depending on the kinds of conditions and circumstances that a patient is going to the hospital with.  The study also did not measure adverse effects. The researchers pointed to another that did: A “similar [emergency department]-based study lasting 90 minutes had an incidence of adverse events of 1.6% in the codeine group, 3.3% in the nonopioid group, and 16.9% in the oxycodone group, with lightheadedness accounting for 70% of adverse events in the oxycodone group.” But since that study used higher doses for opioids than Chang’s research, the findings aren’t comparable to what Chang and his colleagues found.  So the study isn’t the final word. Still, it gives promising insight in a crucial area of public health.  We can pull back on opioids without doing harm  This research falls under the shadow of the opioid epidemic. The current overdose crisis has over time changed to involve all kinds of opioids — painkillers, heroin, and fentanyl. But it originally began with the overprescription of opioid painkillers, which allowed the supply of the prescription drugs to explode. That led opioids to proliferate, landing in the hands of not just patients but also teens rummaging through their parents’ medicine cabinets, other family members, friends of patients, and the black market. (More on the opioid epidemic’s causes and evolution in Vox’s explainer.)  The crisis has led policymakers and health care providers to look at cutting back on prescription opioids. But this comes with a challenge: Policymakers and health care providers also want to make sure that the drugs are available to patients who truly need them.  The study shows that this really might be possible, at least in the kind of emergency room setting that the researchers looked at. If nothing else, it should lead some doctors to rethink the default mode they might have when it comes to acute pain — to always reach for the opioid.  As Chang told me, “If we can administer a combination of non-opioids to patients while they are in the [emergency department] and show them (as well as the treating physician) that it provides comparable pain relief to opioids, then the patient will likely be more accepting of a non-opioid upon discharge, and the physician may feel less pressure to prescribe an opioid.”  Several weeks ago, I underwent surgery for a minor heart condition. (Don’t worry; I’m not going to die — yet, anyway.) In my hospital room, I reported my pain score after the procedure as a six out of 10, and I was vocally resistant to getting opioids. The nurses gave me opioids anyway. I turned out fine, as most people who get opioids in these settings do. But Chang’s study suggests I could have been just as fine if I got a high dose of ibuprofen and acetaminophen instead. Yet there seemed to be a bias in favor of the opioids.  In general, this is what the response to the opioid epidemic has been about: weakening that bias in favor of opioids for treating pain — while ensuring that patients who truly need opioids can still get them.  This applies to chronic pain as well. The evidence for opioids treating chronic pain is very weak (despite their effectiveness for acute pain), while the evidence that opioids cause harm in the long term is very strong. And a recent study found that doctors can wean some chronic pain patients off opioids and actually improve their pain outcomes. More research is needed in this area, but the current evidence suggests that the risks of opioids might not be worth the gains, if there actually are any, for most chronic pain patients.  As with acute pain, that does not mean opioids will never be useful in chronic pain cases. When prescribed carefully on a schedule that works to diminish the excessive buildup of tolerance, they can work for some people. Stanford pain specialist Sean Mackey previously told me that opioids should not be a first-line treatment due to the risks, and alternatives should be tried first — but they can work for some chronic pain patients, and keeping them from such patients can cause unnecessary harm and suffering.  So opioid policy, as with many public health issues, is a balancing act. But studies like Chang’s and other research suggest that it is possible to moderate our opioid use and not inflict unnecessary harm on patients. That could be a crucial step in confronting the ongoing drug epidemic and preventing more crises like it in the future.",3.0,1,[3.0]
1535,3203,11,8,2017,2017-11-08,Vox,This company wants to build a giant indoor farm next to every major city in the world,"For as long as I can remember, people have been hyping vertical farming — growing crops indoors, using vertical space to intensify production.  Its virtues, relative to conventional agriculture, have long been clear. Indoors, the climate can be controlled year-round. Pests can be minimized, and with them pesticides. Water and nutrients can be applied in precise quantities. By going up rather than out, a vertical farm can produce more food per acre of land. And by siting close to an urban area, it can reduce long distribution chains, getting fresher food to customers’ tables, quicker.  Its drawbacks have become equally clear. They mainly come down to cost. Farming well requires deep know-how and expertise; it has proven extraordinarily difficult to expand vertical farms in a way that holds quality consistent while driving costs down. Optimizing production at a small scale is very different from doing so at a large scale. The landscape is littered with the corpses of vertical-farming startups that thought they could beat the odds (though several are still alive and kicking).  Now a young Silicon Valley startup called Plenty thinks it has cracked the code. It has enormous expansion plans and a bank account full of fresh investor funding, but most excitingly, it is building a 100,000 square foot vertical-farming warehouse in Kent, Washington, just outside of Seattle, your author’s home town. That farm is expected to be open and delivering produce locally by midyear, and is designed to produce 4.5 million pounds of greens annually. Your author, in keeping with coastal elitist stereotypes, is a fervent lover of greens.  In part because I now have a personal stake in the matter, I thought I’d take a look at the company, its prospects, the environmental benefits it promises, and — perhaps most importantly — some of the unnerving social and political implications of a vertical farming revolution.  Plenty wants to build a farm near your city  Plenty is at the center of a veritable hurricane of buzz at the moment.  It checks all the boxes: It recently got a huge round of funding ($200 million in July, the largest ag-tech investment in history), including some through Jeff Bezos’s investment firm, so it has the capital to scale; it is leaning heavily on machine learning and AI; it has endorsements from several Michelin-rated chefs (“I’ve never had anything of this quality,” a former sous-chef at French Laundry, Anthony Secviar, told Bloomberg); it is in talks with several large distributors in the US and abroad; heck, it even lured away the director of battery technology at Tesla, Kurt Kelty, to be executive of operations and development. (You’re nothing in Silicon Valley without an ex-Tesla exec.)  “I wanted to figure out where I would contribute to the next big wave,” Kelty told Bloomberg. “I see my next 10-year-run as growing Plenty.""  So, what’s the big deal?  If you want to really dig in, Bloomberg has the best feature story on Plenty (see also Fast Company), but I’ll quickly run through what the company is up to. It’s helpful to read what follows against this list of nine reasons vertical farms fail, by Chris Michael, CEO of vertical-farming company Bright Agrotech. In a sense, Plenty is a response to previous failures.  The company is run by CEO Matt Barnard, a former private equity investor, and CTO Nate Storey, an agronomist who did his doctoral work in tower farming. (Storey also founded Bright Agrotech, which he left to join Plenty. In June, Plenty acquired the company.)  Plenty grows plants on 20-foot vertical towers instead of the stacks of horizontal shelves used by most other vertical-farming companies. Plants jut horizontally from the towers, growing out of a substrate made primarily of recycled plastic bottles (there’s no soil involved). Water and nutrients are fed in from the top of the tower and dispersed by gravity (rather than pumps, which saves money). All water, including from condensation, is collected and recycled.  The plants receive no sunlight, just light from hanging LED lamps. There are thousands of infrared cameras and sensors covering everything, taking fine measurements of temperature, moisture, and plant growth; the data is used by agronomists and artificial intelligence nerds to fine-tune the system.  The towers are so close together that the effect is a giant wall of plants.  Currently, Plenty is focusing on leafy greens and herbs — varieties of lettuce, kale, mustard greens, basil, etc. — but it says it can use the system to grow anything except root vegetables and tree fruits. Strawberries and cucumbers are coming up next. (It’s worth noting that anything beyond leafy greens requires more light and thus more energy, so the source and cost of an indoor farm’s electricity is of keen interest.)  There are virtually no pests in a controlled indoor environment, so Plenty doesn’t have to use any pesticides or herbicides; it gets by with a few ladybugs. The produce from Plenty’s San Francisco warehouse is certified organic, but leaders in the industry also like to stress that vertical farming is local, with an entirely transparent supply chain. (Why yes, you can also get that at your local farmers market.)  Bottom line: Relative to conventional agriculture, Plenty says that it can get as much as 350 times the produce out of a given acre of land, using 1 percent as much water. “It is the most efficient [form of agriculture] in terms of the amount of productive capacity per dollar spent,” Barnard has said. “Period.”  It’s worth reading those claims again, as they are pretty eye-popping. The next grandest claim in the industry is AeroFarms, a Newark, New Jersey company with nine indoor farms, which says it can get to 130 times the amount of produce per acre.  What’s more, Plenty says its products taste better than most of what customers now have access to. Around 35 percent of fruits and vegetables eaten in the US today are imported. Leafy greens travel an average of 2,000 miles to reach your plate. Some produce has been on ships and trucks for two weeks before it reaches the table — having lost, by some estimates, 45 percent of its nutritional value along the way. Produce is bred to survive that long journey with its aesthetics, but not necessarily its flavor, intact.  Plenty plans to build warehouses not inside major cities, but just outside them, next to distribution centers, to minimize the time its food spends in transit — it wants produce to go from harvest to table in hours, rather than days. If it can do that, the company will be able to grow and sell a wide variety of rare and heirloom breeds, which are more tender and flavorful than what’s available at the supermarket, but less resilient to long journeys.  In fact, Barnard says he will save more money on trucks and fuel than he spends on facilities and power.  The company’s goal is to build an indoor farm outside of every city in the world of more than 1 million residents — around 500 in all. It claims it can build a farm in 30 days and pay investors back in three to five years (versus 20 to 40 for traditional farms). With scale, it says, it can get costs down to competitive with traditional produce (for a presumably more desirable product that could command a price premium).  If it can back up those claims in practice, Plenty might not revolutionize global agriculture, but it will sure as hell establish vertical farming as a real thing.  Now, to be very clear: It would be a terrible mistake for anyone to take investment advice from me. I’m not an industry analyst. I have no idea if Plenty will ultimately succeed. It could face difficulty finding affordable urban land; it could have trouble replicating the carefully controlled conditions of its initial warehouse; quality could slip as it output rises; consumers could reject the products for any number of reasons. Many previous alt-farming startups got similar buzz, only to fail. Scaling up is full of peril.  But I do think, if Plenty is not the early Google of this space, some other company will be, soon enough. The traditional barriers of cost and energy that have blocked the industry from growing are crumbling. And the way it’s happening carries some fateful lessons.  Plenty is replacing stuff with intelligence  Entrepreneur Bill Gross said something in a talk once that I never forgot. Every commodity, he said, is finite, and is eventually going to get more expensive — except computing power. Computing power just gets cheaper and cheaper and cheaper. So to the extent you want to ensure low costs in the long term, he said, you substitute computing power for other commodities — intelligence for stuff, as I like to put it.  By intelligence I mean, roughly, the ability to gather data (through sensors), synthesize it (through computing power), and use it to optimize operations (through machine learning). Optimization wrings waste, i.e., extraneous stuff, out of the process.  I have argued before that the current energy transition may well move faster than previous transitions, precisely because it is driven by information technology. To put it crudely, if past energy transitions have replaced giant stuff with other giant stuff, this one is going to replace giant stuff, at least in part, with intelligence.  That same process is taking place in agriculture; that’s part of what vertical farming represents. Zack Bogue, a Plenty investor through Data Collective, a San Francisco venture capital fund, put it this way: “We’re pretty excited about that space because some of the hardest problems in agriculture are now lending themselves to an algorithmic or computational or applied machine-learning solution.”  As Barnard himself put it, agriculture is a “giant optimization problem.” The challenge is to use just the amount of energy, water, and nutrients necessary to produce food, and no more. Big Ag has struggled with optimization for decades, of course, but it remains extraordinarily wasteful — nitrogen runoff producing dead zones in the Gulf, methane and carbon emissions heating the atmosphere, profligate water use leaving water tables depleted, etc.  Plenty uses cameras and sensors to optimize light, temperature, and humidity levels. It is automating the growing process “as much as possible,” Barnard told Business Insider. It even has little robots (“Schleppers”!) that transplant seedlings, because the towers and plants are getting so dense that it’s difficult for a human to operate among them.  Part of what has convinced investors that Plenty has a shot is the radically declining costs of LED lighting. (The efficiency of LEDs puts Plenty on par with conventional agriculture, carbon-wise, at least for some crops, at least when distribution impacts are taken into account; Storey has said he thinks indoor agriculture will be more sustainable in the long haul, especially as the grid gets greener.)  But just as big, possibly bigger, are recent advancements in AI and machine learning. “Utility computing, [internet of things], machine intelligence, wasn’t effective enough five years ago,” Barnard told Fast Company, “much less affordable.” Now, those technologies have reached a level of cost and performance that enables Plenty to fine tune its process. In five more years, computing will be double again as powerful and half again as cheap, enabling yet more automation and optimization.  And that’s great! Mostly.  Plenty is also replacing people with intelligence  I’ve read about 30 articles on Plenty and not one of them has squarely addressed the elephant in the room. To wit: Plenty will succeed insofar as it eliminates food production jobs.  The reason is simple, and found among the aforementioned nine reasons vertical farms fail: “Labor is always your biggest cost.” In the same piece, Matt Liotta of Podponics, a company that tried growing produce in shipping containers and went bankrupt in 2016, is quoted putting it even more bluntly: “People are the problem.”  Industrial agriculture has made ruthless use of scale and automation to minimize labor, but labor remains a huge cost, especially in tasks like harvesting delicate crops like strawberries that can’t easily be mechanized. The same is true for indoor vertical farming: The biggest cost is people.  To compete with industrial ag, vertical farming will have to be even better at reducing the need for human planters and harvesters. In other words, to compete, it’s going to have to create as few jobs as possible.  That’s basically the history of technology — getting more value out of less labor.  The great promise of Plenty is that through automation and optimization, it can make clean, low-input food cost competitive with (morally and chemically) unclean, resource-intensive food. That could potentially save an enormous amount of water and (insofar as it is electrified and powered by renewable energy) radically reduce the carbon emissions of the agricultural sector. Plus it could give millions of people access to fresher, more flavorful, more nutritious fruits and vegetables, making Michelle Obama (and the public health community) happy.  But to do any of that, it has to minimize labor.  Barnard is well aware of that, as is everyone in the industry. “Small-scale growing in 2017 is not a profitable enterprise, and there are a lot of systemic reasons for that that aren’t going to change,” he told Fast Company. “Growing at a small scale, you can’t get to the labor efficiencies that you need. It requires, in essence, too many people.”  “Too many people” is not a great message to communities who might host a farm, though, so Barnard is quick to say that a full-size warehouse like the one planned for Washington will employ as many as several hundred people at skilled, full-time jobs. “While robots can handle some of the harvesting, planting, and logistics,” writes Selina Wang at Bloomberg, “experts will oversee the crop development and grocer relationships on-site.”  Barnard also emphasizes that he’s not competing with traditional agriculture or small-scale urban farming, just adding to the portfolio, seeking to keep up with demand.  But if vertical farming scales as fast as Barnard expects, competing purely on price and efficiency, it will represent a familiar pattern in the US economy — a relatively smaller number of high-skill jobs replacing a relatively larger number of low-skill jobs. In the bigger picture, it is a good thing, to get more and better food for fewer labor and material inputs, but displaced workers tend not to care much about the big picture. And right now agriculture and related industries provide about 11 percent of US employment, according to USDA.  Kevin Drum of Mother Jones recently published a big piece about robots taking all our jobs, thanks to the relentless advance of artificial intelligence. Lots of economists and pundits push back on that kind of thing, citing the lack of movement in productivity statistics.  I have no idea how that will sort out. But I see automation coming for all drivers pretty soon — taxi, bus, garbage truck, delivery van, backhoe, you name it. And now I can see it coming for the agricultural sector. Whether unemployment will spike, as Drum says, or there will just be more and faster churn, there are going to be lots of angry people out of work.  And what are we going to do with all those truck drivers and agricultural workers? I don’t think either party has a good answer. Republicans stomp their feet and insist the jobs will return. Democrats wave their hands at “retraining.”  We better figure it out. We will eventually teach robots to grow our food in giant climate-controlled buildings, optimizing production using AI and machine learning that we can’t yet fathom.  Plenty wasn’t possible five years ago. What will be possible in five more?  Further reading",4.75,2,"[5.0, 4.5]"
1501,3169,11,8,2017,2017-11-08,Breitbart,Stephen Willeford Proves NRA Correct: Good Guys with Guns Stop Bad Guys with Guns,"The NRA’s Wayne LaPierre pointed out a week after the heinous attack on gun-free Sandy Hook Elementary School that good guys with guns are necessary to stop bad guys with guns, which Sunday’s church attack in Sutherland Springs, Texas, has proven correct.  On December 21, 2012, LaPierre said:  Politicians pass laws for Gun-Free School Zones. They issue press releases bragging about them. They post signs advertising them. And in so doing, they tell every insane killer in America that schools are their safest place to inflict maximum mayhem with minimum risk. How have our nation’s priorities gotten so far out of order? Think about it. We care more about our money, so we protect our banks with armed guards. American airports, office buildings, power plants, courthouses — even sports stadiums — are all protected by armed security. We care about the president, so we protect him with armed Secret Service agents. Yet when it comes to the most beloved, innocent, and vulnerable members of the American family — our children — we, as a society, leave them utterly helpless, and the monsters and predators of this world know it and exploit it. That must change now!  He added, “The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.”  LaPierre has been proven right again and again in the years since making that assertion, most recently on November 5, 2017, when Stephen Willeford used an AR-15 to end the Texas church attack.  Willeford is an NRA member, and, as Breitbart News reported, a former NRA instructor. He was in his home near the church when shots rang out, and he grabbed his AR-15 and ran barefoot to the scene to save lives. He told KHBS, “Every time I heard a shot, I knew that probably represented a life. I was scared to death. I was. I was scared for me, and I was scared for every one of them, and I was scared for my own family that just lived less than a block away.”  Yet Willeford went to the church, took cover behind a vehicle, and waited for the attacker, Devin Kelley, to come outside. Once Kelley emerged, Willeford took a shot. “He saw me, and I saw him. I was standing behind a pickup truck for cover. I know I hit him. He got into his vehicle, and he fired another couple rounds through his side window. When the window dropped, I fired another round at him again.”  Willeford then jumped into a truck with Johnnie Langendorff, and the two men gave chase until Kelley ran off the road and died in his vehicle.  Speaking from South Korea on Tuesday, President Trump acknowledged the heroism in response to the church attack and said, “And I can only say this, if he didn’t have a gun, instead of 26 dead, you would have had [many] more dead.”  LaPierre was clearly spot-on when he said, “The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.”  AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

1533,3201,11,8,2017,2017-11-08,Fox News,Rep. Kristi Noem: The death tax must go - This is smart tax reform for our generation (and the next),"I ran into a woman at the grocery store a while back. With her cart full of groceries and her hand full of coupons, she looked at me in line and said: “When will it get better, Kristi? The cost of these groceries, of health care, of child care – they’re all going up, but I haven’t gotten a raise in years.”  She’s not alone. Many American families in every state are asking that exact question: When will it get better? When will the pinch stop?  Last week, House Republicans introduced a once-in-a-generation tax reform package that will finally give folks some breathing room. In fact, the nonpartisan Tax Foundation finds that after years of the status quo, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will increase wages by 3.1 percent, add 975,000 jobs, and raise the after-tax income of the average middle-income family by nearly $2,600.  What’s more, those savings are targeted toward our priorities: maybe most importantly, building strong families.  For instance, at the same time our legislation lowers tax rates across the board, it grows the Child Tax Credit by 60 percent, creates a new Family Flexibility Credit and protects the Child Care Credit for working families.  Our bill also gives people a boost during those milestone times in their lives, such as when they buy a home or save for retirement. On top of it all, the legislation significantly simplifies the tax code, so many busy families can file their taxes on a form as simple as a postcard. Think of the stress that would save come tax time.  And while we offer support to the families raising our next generation, this tax reform package is also designed to help job creators thrive from one generation to the next.  Today more than 70 percent of family businesses don’t make it to the second generation, and 90 percent don’t survive to the third. There are many reasons for this, but our tax code doesn’t make it any easier.  One of the hallmarks of the House GOP plan is a historically low 25 percent tax rate on small businesses that is accompanied by reforms to level the playing field and reduce compliance costs. Additionally, we fully and permanently repeal the Death Tax by 2024, doubling the exemption levels between now and then.  I know there are folks who want to keep the Death Tax in place, who say it doesn’t really impact families. That’s simply false. Our family was hit by the Death Tax when my dad died suddenly in a farming accident.  A few months afterward, we got a letter from the IRS telling us we owed the Death Tax. We were still reeling from the loss of the powerhouse in our family, and already, the government was reaching out its hand to take part of our American Dream. We had a tough choice: sell off a portion of our family farm or face a decade in debt. We took a decade in debt and struggled to keep our heads above water.  From that experience, I learned firsthand how awful and immoral the Death Tax is, but ultimately, the justification for its repeal rests in the fact that it’s a double – sometimes triple – tax. Families hit by it have already paid taxes on their land, machinery, and cattle. Now, because they experienced a tragedy, the federal government forces them to fork over a substantial amount of that hard-earned success.  By eliminating the Death Tax, we’ll eliminate one of the most unfair, un-American taxes on the books – a tax that has threatened second- and third-generation businesses for far too long.  I understand that no tax reform plan will be perfect in everyone’s eyes. Nonetheless, I’m optimistic about the impact this package could have on American families.  With lower rates, a simpler tax code, family-focused policies, and meaningful reforms, I’m hopeful we can finally relieve the pinch that the young woman I met in the grocery store felt. I believe in her. I believe that if we keep more money in her pocket, she can build a strong future for herself – and for the next generation.",1.625,4,"[0.5, 2.0, 3.5, 0.5]"
1536,3204,11,8,2017,2017-11-08,Fox News,"John Stossel: 'Keep it simple, stupid' works with the new tax plan, too","As you read this, President Trump's tax plan is being debated. Congress will change it. Where this ends, no one knows.  I want two things:  1. Simplification.  2. More money in private hands.  Trump offers some of both.  His cuts would leave more money in private hands, where it will be used more efficiently. Politicians' spending decisions already put us $20 trillion in debt; they shouldn't be trusted with more money.  Cutting the corporate tax rate isn't popular (rich people!), but a cut is needed. Economic growth is really important. It's stifled when America's taxes are higher than other nations'.  Trump also offers some simplification. Good. The more complex the rules, the more time we waste hiring accountants and the more time lawyers spend fighting over who qualifies for what. Trump would double the personal exemption (fewer people will itemize) and kill the ""death tax,"" deductions for local taxes and the alternative minimum tax.  It's a start. But that's not nearly good enough. Heck, the ""simplification"" bill itself is 400 pages long.  Americans spend about 7 billion hours trying to comply with today's tax rules. That's the equivalent of 3.7 million people working 40-hour weeks. What a waste.  I spend hours filling out forms and forwarding paperwork to an accountant. I distort my spending and investments because of tax rules. What a waste.  America's first 1040 form was four pages long. Today's code is more than 3.7 million words. No one understands it.  Even the tax specialists get things wrong.  Yet parts of Trump's plan make taxes more complex: He increases the child tax credit and creates a new credit for nonchild dependents. It may be fair to help people who care for helpless adults, but each new deduction creates complexity and parasites who feed off it. As usual, some rich people will game that credit, and some poor people will never figure it out.  Far better to lower everyone's taxes to, say, 15 percent, by getting rid of all deductions.  Then we could focus on creating wealth instead of filling out forms.  But good luck with that, President Trump.  Today's tax deductions are the main reason we've got a huge culture of lobbyists.  One of the most unfair tax breaks is the mortgage interest deduction. It encourages rich people to buy more homes than we need. It exacerbates housing bubbles.  Trump merely proposed cutting the maximum deduction to half-a-million dollars. But even that has the swamp creatures screaming, ""Unfair!""  Jerry Howard of the National Association of Home Builders says he will fight that ""tooth and nail."" He claims it ""is a direct assault on the American dream of homeownership.""  Bunk. Canada has no mortgage deduction, yet Canada's homeownership rate is higher than the United States'. The big mortgage deduction is welfare for the rich.  But people like Howard have clout. Homebuilders and mortgage bankers give politicians money.  Likewise, even some Republicans in high-tax states like New York and New Jersey now are whining about losing state tax deductibility. They fear voter backlash in their districts.  Once again, Congress ends up fighting over who gets the biggest cuts instead of the overall tax haul and size of government.  Ideally, tax cuts should be accompanied by even larger spending cuts to avoid expanding that $20 trillion debt. But that's not happening.  How about a variation on Trump's two-for-one regulation rule (cut two regulations for each new one you propose)? Cut two dollars from the budget for every dollar in tax reduction. That way we won't end up deeper in the hole.  The best way to avoid Washington's spending getting out of balance is to avoid giving them our money in the first place.  I'm rooting for a tax law so simple that everyone understands it, and one that will keep as much money as possible out of government's hands.  That's the best formula for a growing economy.",3.25,2,"[3.5, 3.0]"
1450,3097,11,8,2017,2017-11-08,Associated Press News,"Amid booming economy, homelessness soars on US West Coast"," In a park in the middle of a leafy, bohemian neighborhood where homes list for close to $1 million, a tractor’s massive claw scooped up the refuse of the homeless - mattresses, tents, wooden frames, a wicker chair, an outdoor propane heater. Workers in masks and steel-shanked boots plucked used needles and mounds of waste from the underbrush.  Just a day before, this corner of Ravenna Park was an illegal home for the down and out, one of 400 such encampments that have popped up in Seattle’s parks, under bridges, on freeway medians and along busy sidewalks. Now, as police and social workers approached, some of the dispossessed scurried away, vanishing into a metropolis that is struggling to cope with an enormous wave of homelessness.  That struggle is not Seattle’s alone. A homeless crisis of unprecedented proportions is rocking the West Coast, and its victims are being left behind by the very things that mark the region’s success: soaring housing costs, rock-bottom vacancy rates and a roaring economy that waits for no one. All along the coast, elected officials are scrambling for solutions.  “I’ve got economically zero unemployment in my city, and I’ve got thousands of homeless people that actually are working and just can’t afford housing,” said Seattle City Councilman Mike O’Brien. “There’s nowhere for these folks to move to. Every time we open up a new place, it fills up.”  As the West Coast’s economy booms and more people move to the area, the number of homeless people has spiked to crisis levels. The Associated Press found that the number of homeless people is now 168,000 in California, Oregon and Washington. (Nov. 6)  The rising numbers of homeless people have pushed abject poverty into the open like never before and have overwhelmed cities and nonprofits. The surge in people living on the streets has put public health at risk, led several cities to declare states of emergency and forced cities and counties to spend millions - in some cases billions - in a search for solutions.  San Diego now scrubs its sidewalks with bleach to counter a deadly hepatitis A outbreak that has spread to other cities and forced California to declare a state of emergency last month. In Anaheim, home to Disneyland, 400 people sleep along a bike path in the shadow of Angel Stadium. Organizers in Portland lit incense at a recent outdoor food festival to cover up the stench of urine in a parking lot where vendors set up shop.  Homelessness is not new on the West Coast. But interviews with local officials and those who serve the homeless in California, Oregon and Washington - coupled with an Associated Press review of preliminary homeless data - confirm it’s getting worse. People who were once able to get by, even if they suffered a setback, are now pushed to the streets because housing has become so expensive.  All it takes is a prolonged illness, a lost job, a broken limb, a family crisis. What was once a blip in fortunes now seems a life sentence.  “Most homeless people I know aren’t homeless because they’re addicts,” said Tammy Stephen, 54, who lives at a homeless encampment in Seattle. “Most people are homeless because they can’t afford a place to live.”  Among the AP’s findings:  — Official counts taken earlier this year in California, Oregon and Washington show 168,000 homeless people in the three states, according to an AP tally of every jurisdiction in those states that reports homeless numbers to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. That is 19,000 more than were counted two years ago, although the numbers may not be directly comparable because of factors ranging from the weather to new counting methods.  — During the same period, the number of unsheltered people in the three states - defined as someone sleeping outside, in a bus or train station, abandoned building or vehicle - has climbed 18 percent to 105,000.  — Rising rents are the main culprit. The median one-bedroom apartment in the San Francisco Bay Area is significantly more expensive than it is in the New York City metro area, and apartments in San Francisco are listed at a higher price than those in Manhattan.  — Since 2015, at least 10 cities or municipal regions in California, Oregon and Washington - and Honolulu, as well - have declared states of emergency due to the rise of homelessness, a designation usually reserved for natural disasters.  “What do we want as a city to look like? That’s what the citizens here need to decide,” said Gordon Walker, head of the regional task force for the homeless in San Diego, where the unsheltered homeless population has spiked by 18 percent in the past year. “What are we going to allow? Are we willing to have people die on the streets?”  ___  With alarming frequency, the West Coast’s newly homeless are people who were able to survive on the margins - until those margins moved.  For years, Stanley Timmings, 62, and his 61-year-old girlfriend, Linda Catlin, were able to rent a room in a friend’s house on their combined disability payments.  Last spring, that friend died of colon cancer and the couple was thrust on Seattle’s streets.  Timmings used their last savings to buy a used RV for $300 and spent another $300 to register it. They bought a car from a junk yard for $275.  Now, the couple parks the RV near a small regional airport and uses the car to get around.  They have no running water and no propane for the cook stove. They go to the bathroom in a bucket and dump it behind a nearby business. They shower and do laundry at a nonprofit and buy water at a grocery depot. After four months, the stench of human waste inside the RV is overwhelming. Every inch of space is crammed with their belongings: jugs of laundry detergent, stacks of clothes, pots and pans, and tattered paperback novels. They are exhausted, scared and defeated, with no solution in sight.  “Between the two of us a month, we get $1,440 in disability. We can’t find a place for that,” he said. “Our income is (about) $17,000 ... a year. That puts us way out of the ballpark, not even close. It might have been enough but anymore, no. It’s not.”  A new study funded by the real estate information firm Zillow and conducted by the University of Washington found a strong link between rising housing prices and rising homelessness numbers. A 5 percent rent increase in Los Angeles, for example, would mean about 2,000 more homeless people there, the authors said.  Nationally, homelessness has been trending down, partly because governments and nonprofit groups have gotten better at moving people into housing. That’s true in many West Coast cities, too, but the flow the other direction is even faster. And on the West Coast, shelter systems are smaller.  “If you have a disability income, you make about $9,000 a year and renting a studio in Seattle is about $1,800 a month and so that’s twice your income,” said Margaret King, director of housing programs for DESC, a nonprofit that works with Seattle’s homeless.  “So everybody who was just hanging on because they had cheap rent, they’re losing that ... and they wind up outside. It’s just exploded.”  Nowhere is that more evident than California’s Silicon Valley, where high salaries and a tight housing market have pushed rent out of reach for thousands. In ever-shifting communities of the homeless, RVs and cars cluster by the dozens in the city where Google built its global headquarters and just blocks from Stanford University.  Ellen Tara James-Penney, a lecturer at San Jose State University, has been sleeping out of a car for about a decade, ever since she lost her housing while an undergraduate at the school where she now teaches four English courses, a job that pays $28,000 a year. Home is an old Volvo.  “I’ve basically been homeless since 2007, and I’m really tired,” she said. “Really tired.”  She actually got her start in the high tech industry, before being laid off during the tech meltdown of the early 2000s. Like many who couldn’t find work, she went to college, accumulating tens of thousands of dollars in student debt along the way.  Now 54, she grades papers and prepares lesson plans in her car. Among her few belongings is a pair of her grandmother’s fancy stiletto pumps, a reminder to herself that “it’s not going to be like this forever.”  Increased housing costs aren’t just sweeping up low-income workers: The numbers of homeless youth also is rising.  A recent count in Los Angeles, for example, found that those ages 18 to 24 were the fastest-growing homeless group by age, up 64 percent, followed by those under 18. Los Angeles and other cities have made a concerted effort to improve their tallies of homeless youth, which likely accounts for some of the increase.  One of the reasons is the combined cost of housing and tuition, said Will Lehman, policy supervisor at Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority. A recent study by the University of Wisconsin found that one in five Los Angeles Community College District students is homeless, he said.  “They can pay for books, for classes but just can’t afford an apartment. They’re choosing to prioritize going to school,” Lehman said. “They don’t choose their situation.”  ___  Michael Madigan opened a new wine bar in Portland a few years ago overlooking a ribbon of parks not far from the city’s trendy Pearl District.  Business was good until, almost overnight, dozens of homeless people showed up on the sidewalk. A large encampment on the other side of the city had been shut down, and its residents moved to the park at his doorstep.  “We literally turned the corner one day ... and there were 48 tents set up on this one block that hadn’t been there the day before,” he said.  Madigan’s business dropped 50 percent in four months and he closed his bar. There are fewer homeless people there now, but the campers have moved to a bike path that winds through residential neighborhoods in east Portland, prompting hundreds of complaints about trash, noise, drug use and illegal camping.  Rachel Sterry, a naturopathic doctor, lives near that path and sometimes doesn’t feel safe when she’s commuting by bike with her 1-year-old son. Dogs have rolled in human feces in a local park; recent improvements she’s made to her small home are overshadowed by the line of tents and tarps a few dozen yards from her front door, she said.  “I have to stop and get off my bike to ask people to move their card game or their lounge chairs or their trash out of the way when I’m just trying to get from point A to point B,” she said. “If I were to scream or get hurt, nobody would know.”  For Seattle resident Elisabeth James, the reality check came when a homeless man forced his way into a glass-enclosed ATM lobby with her after she swiped her card to open the door for after-hours access. After a few nerve-wracking minutes, the man left the lobby but stayed outside, banging on the glass. Police were too busy to respond so James called her husband, who scared the man away and walked her home. The man, she believes, just wanted to get out of the rain.  A neighborhood pocket park has become a flashpoint, too: When James took her 2-year-old grandchild there, she saw people injecting heroin.  “I’m not a NIMBY person, but I just think that we can do so much more,” said James, who founded an activist group called Speak Out Seattle last year. “I wanted to do something that was effective, that brought frustrated people together to find solutions. We’re spending a lot of money to house people and we’re getting a bigger problem.”  The crisis is not limited to large metropolises. In Oregon City, a suburban, working-class town of 36,000 people, the police department this summer added a full-time position for a homeless outreach officer after roughly half the calls concerned trash, trespassing, human waste and illegal encampments.  The city has no overnight shelters and never had a significant homeless population until about three years ago.  On a recent fall day, officer Mike Day tromped into a greenbelt across from a strip mall to check on a man he recently connected with a counselor, calmed an intoxicated man and arranged emergency care for a man who was suicidal.  “How many social workers have you met that go into the woods to follow up with the homeless population and to help with mental health? This is a bit of a hybrid position, certainly, and maybe it’s not exactly the role of a police officer - but it’s a creative approach to find a solution to the problem,” he said.  The question was, “What can we do differently? Because right now, it’s not working.”  ___  All along the West Coast, local governments are scrambling to answer that question - and taxpayers are footing the bill.  Voters have approved more than $8 billion in spending since 2015 on affordable housing and other anti-homelessness programs, mostly as tax increases. Los Angeles voters, for example, approved $1.2 billion to build 10,000 units of affordable housing over a decade to address a ballooning homeless population that’s reached 34,000 people within city limits.  Seattle spent $61 million on homeless-related issues last year, and a recent budget proposal would increase that to $63 million. Four years ago, the city spent $39 million on homelessness. Sacramento has set a goal of moving 2,000 people off the streets in the next three years and may place a housing bond before voters in 2018.  Appeals for money have angered residents who see tent encampments growing in their cities despite more spending.  “Those are like whack-a-mole because they just sprout up and then they disappear and then they sprout up somewhere else,” said Gretchen Taylor, who helped found the Neighborhood Safety Alliance of Seattle in 2016.  Seattle is initiating competitive bidding among nonprofit organizations for city dollars going toward homelessness programs. It’s also pouring money into “rapid rehousing,” a strategy that houses people quickly and then provides rental assistance for up to 18 months.  Like San Francisco, Seattle has started opening 24-hour, “low-barrier” shelters that offer beds even if people are abusing drugs, have a pet or want to sleep together as a couple. But the city’s first 24-hour shelter has only 75 beds, and turnover is extremely low.  A team of specially trained police officers and social workers has also been visiting homeless camps to try to place people in shelter. After repeated visits - and with 72 hours of notice - the city cleans out the camps and hauls away abandoned belongings.  These efforts are starting to yield results, although the overall number of homeless people continues to swell.  Nearly 740 families moved into some type of shelter between October 2016 and August 2017, and 39 percent of the people contacted by the new police teams wind up sheltered, according a recent city homeless report. That’s an improvement from a 5 percent shelter rate 18 months ago, said Sgt. Eric Zerr, who leads that effort.  But the approach has its detractors. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit alleging the sweeps violate the constitutional protections against unreasonable search and seizure. And a debate is raging about whether the sweeps are necessary “tough love” or a cruel policy that criminalizes poverty in a city with a reputation for liberalism.  “When a city can’t offer housing, they should not be able to sweep that spot unless it’s posing some sort of significant health and safety issue,” said Sara Rankin, a professor with the Homeless Rights Advocacy Project at the Seattle University School of Law.  “If someone doesn’t have a place to go, you can’t just continue to chase them from place to place.”  ___  Above all, the West Coast lacks long-term, low-income housing for people like Ashley Dibble and her 3-year-old daughter.  Dibble, 29, says she has been homeless off and on for about a year, after her ex-boyfriend squandered money on his car and didn’t pay the rent for three months. Evicted, Dibble says she lived in the back of a moving truck and with several different friends around Seattle before winding up on the streets. She sent her toddler to live with the girl’s paternal grandparents in Florida.  She and her new boyfriend were sleeping under tarps near Safeco Field, home of the Seattle Mariners, when an outreach team referred them to a new shelter. Now, Dibble talks to her daughter daily by phone and is trying to find a way back into housing so she can bring her home.  With an eviction on her record and little income, no one will rent to her.  “I’ve had so many doors slammed in my face, it’s ridiculous,” Dibble said, wiping away tears.  Seattle’s DESC operates 1,200 so-called “permanent supportive housing units” -housing for the mentally ill or severely addicted who can’t stay housed without constant help from case managers, counselors and rehabilitation programs. The nonprofit completes a new building every 18 months and they immediately fill; at any given time, there are only about eight to 10 units free in the whole city - but 1,600 people qualify.  Among this population, “almost nobody’s going to get housing because there isn’t any,” DESC’s Margaret King said. “It doesn’t really matter.”  There is so little housing, and so much despair. Nonprofit workers with decades of experience are shocked by the surge in homeless people and in the banality of the ways they wound up on the streets.  “It’s a sea of humanity crashing against services, and services at this point are overwhelmed, literally overwhelmed. It’s catastrophic,” said Jeremy Lemoine, an outreach case manager with REACH, a Seattle homeless-assistance program. “It’s a refugee crisis right here in the States, right here under our noses.”  “I don’t mean to sound hopeless. I generate hope for a living for people - that there is a future for them - but we need to address it now.”  ___  Associated Press writers Janie Har in San Francisco, Julie Watson in San Diego and Chris Weber in Los Angeles contributed to this report.

The event takes place on the anniversary of the election that put Trump in the White House. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya)  DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Marking a year since President Donald Trump’s election, his fiercest advocates offered different approaches Wednesday for the Republican Party’s way forward after some tough losses Tuesday.  Appearing in key states Trump carried a year ago, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer and Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel called on Republicans to come together, while former White House strategist Steve Bannon maintained an aggressive tone toward any in the GOP who would stand in the president’s way.  Their remarks in Iowa and Michigan underscored the tension bubbling over in Washington.  “Let me tell you, there is a stark difference between the worst Republican and the best Democrat,” Spicer said during the Republican Party of Iowa’s annual Reagan Dinner in Des Moines.  Spicer lamented Republicans in Virginia who decided not to vote Tuesday for GOP gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie because he didn’t pass their “litmus tests.”  Bannon, meanwhile, took aim at veteran Republican lawmakers and entrenched party insiders, whom he has pledged to root out of the Senate next year. He grouped Gillespie — a lobbyist, former RNC chairman and adviser to former President George W. Bush — with the GOP forces of old.  Trump needs more outsiders at his side, Bannon said.  “He’s had some victories. He’s had some defeats,” Bannon said of Trump. “Most of the defeats are because the Republican establishment cannot execute on the plan.”  Bannon spoke at a Republican dinner in Macomb County, Michigan, a working-class Detroit suburb which former President Barack Obama carried twice but where Trump handily beat Democrat Hillary Clinton last year.  Despite Trump’s low approval ratings — 33 percent in a Gallup poll this week, the lowest of his presidency — McDaniel, who also spoke at the Iowa banquet, painted an optimistic picture of the economy, touted record party fundraising and said, “I feel very confident in the candidates I see running across the country.”  “I hope we expand our majority in the Senate so we can get more things done,” she said.  However, Bannon has pledged to find primary opponents for virtually every Republican senator standing for re-election next year, arguing they have not adequately defended Trump against attacks from within his own party, chiefly by Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker and Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake.  With Corker and Flake having announced plans to not seek re-election, Bannon is gunning for GOP Sen. Dean Heller in Nevada and has even mentioned challenging reliable conservatives such as John Barrasso of Wyoming and Deb Fischer of Nebraska.  One of Bannon’s chief goals is ousting Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, whom he blames for not following through on long-promised legislation to undo Obama’s 2010 health care law.  “They only understand one thing. You cannot be nice to these guys,” Bannon said, referring to McConnell. “You have to drop the hammer. That’s what he understands.”  ___  Eggert reported from Warren, Michigan.",4.166666666666667,3,"[4.5, 5.0, 3.0]"
1531,3199,11,8,2017,2017-11-08,Vox,This woman’s Thanksgiving plight perfectly captures America’s fraught food culture,"In response to a great New York Times column by Aaron E. Carroll about America’s obsession with clean eating, a reader recently shared her mounting anxieties about hosting Thanksgiving dinner. Her story perfectly encapsulates what a burden our atomized food culture can be:  Welcome to the United States of Divided Dinner Tables. We’ve shifted from a culture where everyone eats the same thing at supper to a hyper-individualized one, where guests almost certainly won’t be willing to break the same bread, or eat any bread at all.  On holidays like Thanksgiving, we now bring our diets, health issues, and world-changing eating agendas to dinner with us. This isn’t always a bad thing; it can be evidence of a growing awareness about where our food comes from and what it can do to our bodies.  But some of our dietary aversions are more driven by fear than reason, as Carroll — author of the new book, The Bad Food Bible — pointed out in the Times: “By fretting about food, we turn occasions for comfort and joy into sources of fear and anxiety. And when we avoid certain foods, we usually compensate by consuming too much of others.”  Our divided dinner tables also mean hosts like Ellen can be left panicking over how to accommodate everyone — and swilling vodka in the kitchen to cope.  It’s no surprise that Thanksgiving is more complicated for cooks these days. Just look at the statistics. At any given time, some 7.5 percent of Americans are on a diet — trying to reduce their carb intake, increase their protein, or avoid inflammation-promoting foods.  The number of Americans who follow gluten-free diets has skyrocketed — despite the astonishing dearth of evidence supporting these diets for people who don’t have Celiac disease or wheat allergy.  With sugar as the public health enemy du jour, Thanksgiving pecan pie may be more likely to be met with dread than pleasure.  Then there are the religion-based food restrictions (Kosher, Halal, etc.) that some follow. And there are the allergies that require people to avoid certain foods, or risk anaphylactic shock. These are also on the rise, further confounding the Thanksgiving dinner table.  Some 6 to 8 percent of children under age 3 and up to 3 percent of adults now have a food allergy, according to the Mayo Clinic. Peanut allergies, while still rare (affecting about 1 to 2 percent of US children) have more than doubled over the past decade in North America.  More and more Americans are also avoiding animal products. According to the NDP Group, 27 million Americans now identify as plant-based eaters, following vegan, vegetarian, or flexible vegetarian diets, while per capita consumption of dairy alternatives has grown since 2013. So the staple of the holiday, the Thanksgiving turkey, and that ice cream with the pecan pie, are also now controversial terrain.  If you take the long view of history, it makes sense we’re more persnickety eaters these days. Food has never been as cheap, plentiful, or varied. With this abundance has come obesity and other diet-related diseases, as well as environmental crises, that are forcing us to think harder about what we’re putting in our troughs.  If current trends hold, though, in a few years, hosts like Ellen may be better off serving a big bowl of quinoa during the holidays than a turkey. Might that please everyone?  Join the conversation  We loved reading Ellen’s story, and we’d love to hear from you: What’s it like to host Thanksgiving or be a guest in the United States of divided dinner tables?

1530,3198,11,8,2017,2017-11-08,Fox News,Snapchat is getting a new look because it's 'too hard to use',"One of the major complaints about Snapchat over the years has been that it's too hard to use. As it struggles to grow its user base, CEO Evan Spiegel says he is finally acknowledging its detractors, and will redesign the app.  During the company's third-quarter earnings call to investors on Tuesday, Spiegel made the bombshell announcement, after detailing feedback that the app has been a tough nut to crack for a number of people.  “One thing that we have heard over the years is that Snapchat is difficult to understand or hard to use, and our team has been working on responding to this feedback,” Spiegel said on the call. “As a result, we are currently redesigning our application to make it easier to use.”  TEENS STILL HATE FACEBOOK, LOVE INSTAGRAM, SNAPCHAT  Spiegel added that Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, does not yet know what effects the changes will have on its user base.  ""We don't yet know how the behavior of our community will change when they begin to use our updated application,"" he stated. ""We're willing to take that risk for what we believe are substantial long-term benefits to our business.""  Last quarter, Snapchat added just 4.5 million daily active users to bring its total to 178 million. By comparison, Facebook has 2.07 billion monthly active users and 1.37 billion daily active users. Instagram, which implemented some of Snapchat's most popular features including Stories, recently announced it surpassed 800 million monthly active users.  Spiegel's comments came on a conference call with industry analysts after the company posted the lackluster user-growth numbers and revenue that fell well short of Wall Street expectations. Snap's stock was bludgeoned Wednesday, falling 16 percent to $12.70 in early morning trading. The Venice, California, company went public in March at $17 a share.  Snapchat needs to grow its user base beyond 13 to 34 year olds in the U.S., France the U.K. and Australia, Spiegel said. This, he said, includes Android users, people older than 34 and what he called ""rest of world"" markets.  Meanwhile, Snap said Wednesday that Chinese internet company Tencent has acquired a 10 percent stake in the company. Tencent runs the WeChat messaging app, as well as online payment platforms and games. Earlier this year, Tencent bought a 5 percent stake in Tesla Inc.  MAN PLEADS GUILTY IN RAPE THAT VICTIM POSTED TO SNAPCHAT  Analysts are wary that the changes may cause some disruption to Snapchat's business, at least in the interim. In a note to investors, Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White said these changes ""may cause some short-term disruption to the business when consummated but we believe a long-term positive for the platform.""  Spiegel did not go into detail when the changes would be forthcoming, adding that it would be a ""surprise,"" but did add some context on how the app would look after the changes were implemented.  ""As part of the redesign I mentioned earlier, we are going to make it easier to discover the vast quantity of content on our platform that goes undiscovered or unseen every day,"" Spiegel said. ""We think that there is a big opportunity to surface some of this content in a personalized and more relevant way, while still maintaining the exploratory nature of our service.""

1603,3322,11,8,2017,2017-11-08,Breitbart,Breitbart News Surpasses Washington Post to Become 48th Most Popular U.S. Website,"Breitbart News has surpassed the Washington Post in the U.S. Alexa traffic rankings.  According to recent Alexa data, Breitbart News has beaten the Washington Post in the U.S. traffic rankings. Breitbart News is now the 48th most visited website in the entire United States, while the Washington Post is now the 50th most visited website.  Alexa is an Amazon-owned company that tracks the rankings and popularity of numerous websites, and the Washington Post is also owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, both of whom have been critical of President Donald Trump and Breitbart News, adding credence to Alexa’s ranking of Breitbart.  This new ranking comes shortly after bogus allegations that Breitbart News had seen a decline in traffic following the 2016 election. Vanity Fair claimed in a hit piece written by Tina Nguyen that Breitbart’s Alexa U.S. ranking had fallen to #281, which is demonstrably false. The drop in rankings was entirely due to a technical glitch by Alexa that, once fixed, saw Breitbart’s ranking rise back up to #59, which it has now surpassed to reach #48.  Axios attempted a similar smear, claiming that conservative media had experienced a drastic traffic slump in the past year, a provably false metric given that Breitbart’s Alexa ranking has increased from the start of the year.  Breitbart News has also seen massive success across social media, earning the top Facebook post of any major U.S. publication following President Trump’s remarks on the NFL national anthem protests. Breitbart News was also revealed to be the most engaged political publisher on Instagram for September.  Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow commented on the website’s massive success, saying, “This is an incredible testament to the resilience of our staff and our fans. Breitbart News has been the target of one bogus smear campaign after the next, but we keep producing vital work, and readers can’t get enough of it. We have the best audience in all of media, and it also happens to be one of the biggest.”",1.0,1,[1.0]

Trump is on a five-country trip through Asia traveling to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)  BEIJING (AP) — The standoff over North Korea’s nuclear weapons and demands that China do more to balance trade with America will dominate President Donald Trump’s agenda in Beijing.  Trump’s meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping will be grander than their informal April talks at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. That visit was most memorable for Trump informing Xi about ordering a missile strike on Syria while they ate a dessert of chocolate cake.  Officials from both sides say Trump has forged a personal connection with Xi, and Chinese officials have said they expect the leaders to continue to have “in-depth, constructive, friendly and productive” talks.  Xi was named last month to a second five-year term as the leader of China’s Communist Party at a congress that elevated his status as China’s most powerful leader in decades. In a recent interview, Trump likened Xi to “a king.”  A look at the thorny issues the two leaders will likely discuss:  ___  NORTH KOREA  China is North Korea’s chief trading partner and source of aid and diplomatic support, and Trump has pressed for Beijing to take more forceful measures against Pyongyang.  China has already agreed to tough new U.N. penalties that would substantially cut foreign revenue for the isolated North. It has ordered North Korean-owned businesses and ventures with Chinese partners to close by early January. China also has promised to cut off gas and limit shipments of refined petroleum products, effective Jan. 1.  Beijing, however, adamantly opposes steps that could bring down North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un’s government. Thus China has made no mention of crude oil, which makes up the bulk of Chinese energy supplies to North Korea and is not covered by U.N. sanctions.  China argues that sanctions alone cannot solve the impasse, and has urged Washington to cool its rhetoric and open a dialogue with North Korea. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters last month that Washington has lines of communication to Pyongyang.  ___  TRADE  Trump wants to narrow China’s trade surplus with the United States, which stood at $347 billion in 2016, but has yet to say what he might propose this week.  Washington has raised duties on Chinese goods including stainless steel and plywood to offset what it says are improper subsidies and is investigating whether Beijing improperly pressures foreign companies to hand over technology.  Some American companies worry that Trump’s focus on trade in goods might mean he pays too little attention to other issues such as Chinese rules that limit their presence in finance, health care and other service industries.  Chinese officials have rejected U.S. accusations that China engages in predatory policies at the expense of its neighbors.  ___  SOUTH CHINA SEA  China and the U.S. are at odds over Beijing’s military buildup, island-building and assertive claims to disputed islands in the South China Sea.  Washington has criticized such moves and says it has a national interest in freedom of navigation in sea lanes critical for world trade. Tillerson said last month that China’s “provocative actions” in the waters are a challenge to international law and norms.  But China says the U.S. has no territorial claim in those waters and should let countries in the region manage their own disputes.  “I think it would certainly be better if others, including the United States, would not try to interfere in this constructive process,” China’s ambassador to the U.S., Cui Tiankai, told reporters in Washington last week.  ___  MARKET ACCESS, DATA CONTROLS  The American Chamber of Commerce in China wants Beijing to ease market barriers such as limits on foreign ownership of enterprises in finance and other industries.  The chamber has called for faster approval of new seeds and agriculture-related biotechnology. Foreign business groups express concern that Chinese plans for government-led development of electric cars and other technology will limit their presence in emerging industries.  U.S. companies also say increasing Chinese restrictions on internet use, the movement of data and the use of foreign security technology hamper their business and give local competitors an unfair advantage.  Foreign business groups have appealed to Beijing to scale back or scrap rules that Chinese officials say will safeguard national security and personal privacy but that companies warn might weaken data protections. Trump has yet to say what action his government might take.  Twitter is among the platforms blocked by Chinese censors.  Asked whether Trump would be able to tweet from Beijing, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang told reporters on Friday, “We take everything into account on receiving foreign heads of state, so you should have no reservations about Mr. President’s ability to keep in touch with the outside.”  ___  OPIOIDS  Trump has said he will make China’s connection to the U.S. opioid crisis a major theme of his talks.  Chinese officials have disputed Trump’s claim that the opioid fentanyl, which is flooding the U.S., is produced mostly in China. China doesn’t deny that some fentanyl produced illicitly inside the country makes its way to the United States, but officials say there is no data proving the majority of fentanyl used in the U.S. comes from China.  Trump said last month that the U.S. was stepping up measures to curb the flow of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid. He has said he would mention it to Xi.  “And he will do something about it,” Trump said.",3.4375,8,"[2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 2.5, 3.0, 4.5, 4.0, 4.5]"

(Thomas Peter/Pool Photo via AP)  BEIJING (AP) — China reported that its politically volatile trade surplus with the United States narrowed in October from the previous month as President Donald Trump arrived Wednesday on an official visit with commercial issues high on his agenda.  China’s global exports rose 6.9 percent to $188.9 billion, a decline from September’s 8.1 percent growth, customs data showed. Imports rose 17.2 percent to $150.9 billion, down from the previous month’s 18.7 percent increase.  Exports to the United States rose 11.2 percent while imports of U.S. goods rose 17.4 percent, the customs agency reported.  The trade surplus with the United States was $26.6 billion, a decline of $1.5 billion from September but a 12.2 percent increase compared with a year earlier. The total surplus with the United States for the first nine months of the year was $223 billion.  Export growth was unexpectedly strong in the first half of the year, a positive sign for Chinese leaders who want to avoid job losses in trade-related industries as they try to nurture consumer-led economic growth.  The outlook for Chinese exports has been clouded by mounting pressure from Washington to narrow the country’s trade surplus. The Trump administration has boosted duties Chinese goods such as stainless steel and plywood to offset what it says are improper subsidies.  “Export growth eased somewhat in October to a pace that is still solid, indicating that global demand momentum remains resilient,” Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics said in a report. “However, as trade with the U.S. takes the limelight amid U.S. President Trump’s China visit, we estimate that the U.S.’s trade deficit with China will rise to close to $370 billion this year, adding to trade tensions.”  Trump has complained about the size of the U.S. trade gap with China but has yet to say what he might propose in Beijing.  His government also is investigating whether Beijing is violating its free-trade commitments by pressuring foreign companies to hand over technology in return for market access.  Some American companies worry Trump’s focus on trade in goods might mean he pays too little attention to barriers to market access in services such as finance and health care.  China’s trade surplus with the 28-nation European Union, its biggest trading partner, narrowed by 6.6 percent to $11.3 billion.  ___  General Administration of Customs of China: www.customs.gov.cn",3.75,6,"[4.5, 2.5, 4.5, 4.0, 3.0, 4.0]"

Congress will change it. Where this ends, no one knows.  I want two things:  1. Simplification.  2. More money in private hands.  Trump offers some of both.  His cuts would leave more money in private hands, where it will be used more efficiently. Politicians' spending decisions already put us $20 trillion in debt; they shouldn't be trusted with more money.  Cutting the corporate tax rate isn't popular (rich people!), but a cut is needed. Economic growth is really important. It's stifled when America's taxes are higher than other nations'.  Trump also offers some simplification. Good. The more complex the rules, the more time we waste hiring accountants and the more time lawyers spend fighting over who qualifies for what. Trump would double the personal exemption (fewer people will itemize) and kill the ""death tax,"" deductions for local taxes and the alternative minimum tax.  It's a start. But that's not nearly good enough. Heck, the ""simplification"" bill itself is 400 pages long.  Americans spend about 7 billion hours trying to comply with today's tax rules. That's the equivalent of 3.7 million people working 40-hour weeks. What a waste.  I spend hours filling out forms and forwarding paperwork to an accountant. I distort my spending and investments because of tax rules. What a waste.  America's first 1040 form was four pages long. Today's code is more than 3.7 million words. No one understands it.  Even the tax specialists get things wrong.  Yet parts of Trump's plan make taxes more complex: He increases the child tax credit and creates a new credit for nonchild dependents. It may be fair to help people who care for helpless adults, but each new deduction creates complexity and parasites who feed off it. As usual, some rich people will game that credit, and some poor people will never figure it out.  Far better to lower everyone's taxes to, say, 15 percent, by getting rid of all deductions.  Then we could focus on creating wealth instead of filling out forms.  But good luck with that, President Trump.  Today's tax deductions are the main reason we've got a huge culture of lobbyists.  One of the most unfair tax breaks is the mortgage interest deduction. It encourages rich people to buy more homes than we need. It exacerbates housing bubbles.  Trump merely proposed cutting the maximum deduction to half-a-million dollars. But even that has the swamp creatures screaming, ""Unfair!""  Jerry Howard of the National Association of Home Builders says he will fight that ""tooth and nail."" He claims it ""is a direct assault on the American dream of homeownership.""  Bunk. Canada has no mortgage deduction, yet Canada's homeownership rate is higher than the United States'. The big mortgage deduction is welfare for the rich.  But people like Howard have clout. Homebuilders and mortgage bankers give politicians money.  Likewise, even some Republicans in high-tax states like New York and New Jersey now are whining about losing state tax deductibility. They fear voter backlash in their districts.  Once again, Congress ends up fighting over who gets the biggest cuts instead of the overall tax haul and size of government.  Ideally, tax cuts should be accompanied by even larger spending cuts to avoid expanding that $20 trillion debt. But that's not happening.  How about a variation on Trump's two-for-one regulation rule (cut two regulations for each new one you propose)? Cut two dollars from the budget for every dollar in tax reduction. That way we won't end up deeper in the hole.  The best way to avoid Washington's spending getting out of balance is to avoid giving them our money in the first place.  I'm rooting for a tax law so simple that everyone understands it, and one that will keep as much money as possible out of government's hands.  That's the best formula for a growing economy.",4.416666666666667,6,"[4.5, 3.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 5.0]"

Northam succeeds fellow Democrat Terry McAuliffe, as Republicans have not won a statewide election in Virginia since 2009.  Women backed Northam by 19 percentage points, while men backed Gillespie by just 2 points. That gender gap of 21 points is wider than both the 2013 (12 points) and 2009 (13 points) gubernatorial elections.  Virginia  Fox News Voter Analysis Governor  Northam Strengths  Women +19 Pts.  Blacks +85 Pts.  College Degree +19 Pts.  Moderates +26 Pts.  As of 11:30PM 11/07/17  Gillespie racked up an 11-point margin among white voters (55 to 44 percent). Still, that’s a narrower margin than 2013 (when white voters favored the Republican by 20 points) and 2009 (35 points).  Democrats continue to win large margins of black voters in Virginia. Northam won 92 percent, similar to Democrats’ totals in the past two elections.  FOX NEWS VOTER ANALYSIS FINAL RESULTS - VIRGINIA GOVERNOR  Voters with a college degree favored Northam, 59 to 40 percent. That represents a shift from 2013, when McAuliffe and Republican Ken Cuccinelli split college-educated voters 46-46 percent.  College-educated whites went for Northam by 7 points, while whites without a college degree, a major source of support for President Trump in 2016, went for Gillespie by nearly two-to-one.  Virginia  Fox News Voter Analysis Governor  Whites No Degree  Northam 36%  Gillespie 63%  As of 11:30PM 11/07/17  Predictably, liberals went for Northam (by 83 points) and conservatives preferred Gillespie (by 67 points). But it was the large block of moderates who proved decisive, voting for Northam by a 26-point margin.  The race got ugly down the stretch, with hard-hitting attack ads from both sides – and more voters blamed Gillespie than Northam. Six-in-ten said Gillespie attacked Northam unfairly, while just less than half felt the reverse.  Fox News Voter Analysis Virginia  Gillespie Attack Northam Unfairly?

Yes 48%  No 45%  As of 11:30PM 11/07/17  Despite the attack ads, roughly half of voters had positive views of both Northam (52 percent) and Gillespie (46 percent). Virginians felt more positively about former President Barack Obama (58 percent favorable), while 45 percent held a favorable view of Governor McAuliffe.  Trump’s favorability in Virginia is underwater: 42 percent favorable to 56 percent unfavorable. Just over one-third of voters said they were excited or optimistic about the way the Trump administration is working.  Fox News Voter Analysis Virginia  Feelings About How Trump  Administration Is Working  Excited 9%  Optimistic 27%  Concerned 28%  Scared 34%  As of 11:30PM 11/07/17  Trump was an important factor for more than one third (38 percent) of voters, and those folks broke for Northam by a sizable 39-point margin.  Virginia  Fox News Voter Analysis Governor  Donald Trump Important To Vote  Northam 69%  Gillespie 30%  As of 11:30PM 11/07/17  On Monday, Trump tweeted the Virginia economy has been “terrible” with Democrats holding the governor’s mansion. Virginians disagreed: 64 percent rated the economy as either excellent or good. Just 5 percent said the economy is in poor shape.  As a result, health care (28 percent) – rather than the economy (26 percent) – narrowly topped voters’ list of the top issues facing the state.  Fox News Voter Analysis Virginia  Most Important Issue Facing The State  Health Care 28%  Economy 26%  Education 14%  Taxes 9%  Gun Policy 8%  Immigration 7%  Confederate Monuments 4%  Energy Policy 3%  As of 11:30PM 11/07/17  Northam, a pediatric neurologist, won health care voters by a wide 45-point margin, and held a smaller edge among education voters (+32 points). Gillespie won those most concerned about taxes (+29 points) and the economy (+15 points).  When it comes to health care, 40 percent of Virginian voters think the Affordable Care Act went too far – and Gillespie won these voters by 75 points. However, a majority either believes Obamacare was about right (27 percent) or didn’t go far enough (31 percent), and Northam racked up wide margins among both groups (+73 and +64 points, respectively).  Fox News Voter Analysis Virginia  Feelings About Health Care Law  Didn’t Go Far Enough 31%  About Right 27%  Went Too Far 40%  As of 11:30PM 11/07/17  Gillespie made sanctuary cities a focal point of his advertising, and he won among the 7 percent of voters who named immigration as the top issue facing the state by 63 points. However, Gillespie’s anti-immigration stance put him at odds with the 58 percent of Virginians who believe immigrants to the U.S. do more to help the country than hurt it.  Virginia  Fox News Voter Analysis Governor  Immigrants To The U.S.  Help The Country  Northam 77%  Gillespie 22%  As of 11:30PM 11/07/17  Gillespie was endorsed by the National Rifle Association, and he garnered a 21-point margin among gun-owner households (60-39 percent). But after recent mass shootings in Las Vegas and Texas, a majority of voters said it was more important to protect citizens from gun violence (57 percent) than protect the right to own guns (40 percent).  Fox News Voter Analysis Virginia  Which Is More Important To Protect?  Right To Own Guns 40%  Citizens From Gun Violence 57%  As of 11:30PM 11/07/17  By nearly two-to-one, voters agreed with Gillespie’s position that Confederate monuments should stay up rather than be taken down (62 to 33 percent). However, it wasn’t a key issue for voters - only 4 percent rated the monuments issue as a top one facing the state.  In total, around 2.6 million Virginians turned out to vote, despite rain throughout the state. How about those who didn’t vote? Non-voters were more likely to be non-white (53 percent), under age 30 (48 percent), and without a college degree (76 percent).  If they had pulled the lever, these non-voters said they would have opted for Northam by a 62-33 margin.

Facebook says it has a solution – as long as you’ll hand over the photos first.  The social media giant recently announced its new plan to combat “revenge porn,” when individuals post nude photos online without the consent of the subject.  The initiative may seem trivial, but according to a 2016 study by Data & Society, nearly 10 percent of women under the age of 30 have fallen victim to “revenge porn” or have had someone threaten to post their explicit photos online.  SNAPCHAT IS GETTING A NEW LOOK BECAUSE ITS 'TOO HARD TO USE'  Facebook’s new plan promises to stop these types of posts by archiving digital copies of submitted photos and using image-matching technology to prevent any future uploads of them, The Washington Post reported.  The company will test launch the program in Australia by partnering with the Office of the eSafety Commissioner, a government agency “committed to helping young people have safe, positive experiences online.”  The pilot program allows worried users to complete an online form on the eSafety Commissioner’s official website, detailing the specifics of their concern. The user will then send themselves the photo on Facebook Messenger, while the eSafety Commissioner’s officer notifies Facebook. Finally, the company’s community operations team will “source and hash” the image to prevent any future uploads or shares, a Facebook spokesperson explained.  “It would be like sending yourself your image in email, but obviously this is a much safer, secure end-to-end way of sending the image without sending it through the ether,” Australia’s eSafety commissioner, Inman Grant, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. “They’re not storing the image, they’re storing the link and using artificial intelligence and other photo-matching technologies.”  But there is a catch.  According to reports from The Verge, even if a nude photo is submitted to the company, Facebook's technology can only protect the user if the photo’s original file is uploaded - copies of the photo could be more difficult to stop.  NASA IS WORKING WITH UBER ON FLYING TAXIS  Digital forensics expert Lesley Carhart emphasized the complexity of completely deleting a digital file.  “Yes, they’re not storing a copy, but the image is still being transmitted and processed, leaving forensic evidence in memory and potentially on disk.” Carhart told The Post.  But Facebook says that the technology is trustworthy.  A company spokesperson added that the innovative technology was developed with global safety experts, in order to help Facebook provide a supportive and inclusive environment.  Privacy & Sexual Consent lawyer Carrie Goldberg agrees and is “delighted” by Facebook’s initiative.  “With its billions of users, Facebook is one place where many offenders aggress because they can maximize the harm by broadcasting the nonconsensual porn to those most close to the victim,” Goldberg said to the Guardian. “So this is impactful.”  At the end of its most recent quarter, Facebook had 2.07 billion monthly active users.

Ralph Northam won the Virginia governorship for the Democrats, Phil Murphy took back the New Jersey governor’s seat after eight years of GOP control, and down-ballot races in both states look good for team blue. Voters in Maine approved a referendum expanding Medicaid in the state, while in Washington state, a Democratic victory in a key swing district should give the party total majority control of both houses on the state legislature along with the governorship.  There’s no real secret to the nationwide Democratic victories: President Donald Trump is historically unpopular. His administration is shockingly corrupt, two of his top campaign aides were just indicted by a special counsel while a third aide pleaded guilty, his behavior is in turn grotesque, insulting, and authoritarian, most Americans hate his policy priorities, and he’s been unable to get them passed anyway. All this excited Democratic turnout and depressed Republican turnout.  Here in the real world, the president is dragging down his party.  But Trump’s media allies don’t live in the real world. And so, if you turned on Fox last night or this morning, you heard his sycophants saying that the lesson from last night’s Republican wipeout is that the party’s candidates need to hug Trump closer (Trump himself has made the same argument).  On Fox & Friends, one of the president’s favorite shows, co-host Steve Doocy took issue this morning with the idea that the election results were a “Trump rebuke,” saying of the Republican gubernatorial candidates in Virginia and New Jersey, “Neither one of them really brought Donald Trump on board.” “It’s a wake-up call for establishment Republicans,” he added. “If you don’t embrace the leader of your party, why do you want to win and why do you think you can?”  According to Fox host Laura Ingraham last night, Virginia’s Republican gubernatorial nominee, Ed Gillespie, lost because “there is no middle ground with conservative populism. … Maybe Gillespie wouldn’t have won if President Trump campaigned with him, but trying to be half-in, half-out was never going to work. If you dip your toe just in a little bit, you’re going to turn out like Ed Gillespie did, political roadkill.” She also suggested that Gillespie should have campaigned more vigorously on keeping up Confederate memorial statues and “law and order.”  Shortly after announcing Northam’s victory last night, Tucker Carlson said, “It's hard to see Ed Gillespie as a Trump candidate.” He took issues with the “stories in the last week about how he was running on the Trump template.”  When Trump’s friends at Fox weren’t blaming Republican candidates for insufficient fealty to the president, they were trying to ignore the news altogether. All Sean Hannity had to say about the results last night was that they did not come in “states Donald Trump won.” The Fox shows spent significant time talking about the president’s speech in North Korea, the dangers of progressive efforts to prevent gun violence, and the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination fight, as well as reminiscing over Trump’s election a year ago.

Vice President Mike Pence offers a list of President Trump’s accomplishments since he won the election, only one year ago today:  Thanks to the president’s leadership, the American economy is roaring. Businesses have created nearly 1.5 million new jobs. Manufacturers haven’t been this confident in 20 years. The stock market is setting records, creating nearly $5 trillion in wealth for the pension, retirement and savings of the American people. And after eight years of lackluster growth, the economy has already expanded by at least 3% for two quarters in a row.  The U.S. economy is making a comeback because President Trump has taken decisive action to spur a new era of opportunity, prosperity and growth.  We’ve unleashed American energy, approved the Keystone and Dakota pipelines, and under President Trump, the “war on coal” is over.  We’re appointing originalists to the federal courts, to uphold the Constitution and all our God-given liberties. And President Trump put Justice Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court.  President Trump has also taken decisive action to ensure the safety and security of the American people, at home and abroad. He has stood without apology with the men and women of law enforcement. We’re securing our borders, enforcing our laws and taking the gang members, drug dealers and violent criminals off our streets.  The president is putting our veterans first. He signed bills to restore accountability to the Department of Veterans Affairs and give veterans access to the world-class care they deserve.  We’re rebuilding our military. President Trump has already signed the largest increase in defense spending in nearly 10 years, and we are working with Congress to pass one of the largest investments in the national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan.  With renewed American strength, the president is achieving real results on the international stage.  Our NATO allies are contributing more to our common defense. ISIS is on the run, and its caliphate is crumbling. This president reaffirmed the credibility of American power when he enforced a red line against chemical weapons in Syria. He put Iran on notice and made it clear that we cannot certify the Iran nuclear deal. And our administration has brought unprecedented economic and diplomatic pressure to bear on North Korea.  It has been a year of accomplishments, and we’re just getting started. Before this year is out, we’ll pass historic tax cuts for the American people. And with President Trump’s leadership, I know: We will Make America Great Again.",0.75,2,"[1.0, 0.5]"
1560,3228,11,8,2017,2017-11-08,Associated Press News,Homeland nominee questions human role in climate change,"Kirstjen Nielsen testifies during a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee hearing on her nomination to be Department of Homeland Security Secretary, Wednesday, Nov. 8, 2017, on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)  WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s choice to head the Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday that she believes climate change exists, but said she cannot determine whether humans are the primary cause.  Speaking at her Senate confirmation hearing, Kirstjen Nielsen said she is “not prepared to determine causation” on climate change.  Nielsen’s comment contradicts mainstream climate science, including a U.S. report last week that concludes the evidence of global warming is stronger than ever and that it’s “extremely likely” — meaning with 95 to 100 percent certainty — that global warming is man-made.  As head of homeland security, Nielsen would oversee a sprawling agency that leads the federal response to a range of natural disasters from wildfires to hurricanes.  Democrats criticized Nielsen’s answer, which is in line with top Trump administration officials who downplay humans’ role in climate change.  Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., said his state is “sinking” as oceans rise. He called Nielsen’s comment troubling. “Ninety-eight percent of our scientists say this is a problem and we as humans are the root cause,” Carper said.  Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., urged Nielsen to “educate yourself” about climate change, adding “What I heard in your answer is politics before science. That concerns me greatly.”  Nielsen, a former Homeland security official who now serves as deputy White House chief of staff, told the Senate Homeland Security Committee that she agrees climate change is important and said the Trump administration is revising its climate models to better respond to rising sea levels.  “I can’t unequivocally state it’s caused by humans,” she said. “There are many contributions to it.”  A 1,500-page draft report by the U.S. Global Change Research Program said global warming is already sickening, injuring and killing Americans with changes to weather, food, air, water and diseases. And it’s expected to get worse, hurting the economy, wildlife and energy supply, the report said.  On other topics, Nielsen said she agreed with former Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly — now White House chief of staff — that a U.S.-Mexico border wall is unlikely to be a physical barrier from “sea to shining sea.”  She also condemned white nationalism and refuted Islamophobia and promised to make cybersecurity a top priority.  Nielsen, a former staffer at the DHS, said the scope and pace of cyberattacks on federal networks and critical infrastructure are “continually increasing” and grow more complex and sophisticated each day. She said threats to the homeland “are too many and too varied” for any one agency to confront alone and pledged to work across government and the private sector to find solutions.  Trump nominated Nielsen last month to succeed Kelly. He and others in the administration have spoken about the geographical and logistical obstacles to building a massive wall along the border. Trump repeatedly promised during the campaign that he would build the wall and that Mexico would pay for it, but the administration is seeking billions in taxpayer dollars to finance the project.  Homeland Security has been leading the charge on implementing Trump’s aggressive immigration agenda, and Nielsen pledged to continue that work.  “I will work every day to enforce ours laws, secure our borders, coasts and waterways and protect Americans from dangerous criminals, terrorists, cyberattacks and other threats,” she said.  After Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast in 2005, Nielsen led an effort to revise disaster-response and recovery plans, work that drew praise from former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff.  But Nielsen’s involvement in Katrina came under harsh scrutiny a decade ago.  Reports issued two years later by Congress were highly critical of the Bush administration’s handling of the storm. The reports faulted the White House Homeland Security Council — where Nielsen directed preparedness and response — for failing to take the lead in staying on top of the unfolding disaster.  Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, the committee’s top Democrat, said she hopes Nielsen applies lessons learned from Katrina and other disasters to improve oversight of DHS contracting practices.",4.0,2,"[3.5, 4.5]"
1559,3227,11,8,2017,2017-11-08,Associated Press News,Stellar encore: Dying star keeps coming back big time,"This illustration made available by the European Southern Observatory in 2014 shows shows dust surrounding a supernova explosion. On Wednesday, Nov. 8, 2017, astronomers reported that a star 500 million light-years away exploded in 1954 and apparently again in 2014. The research confounds scientists who thought they knew how dying stars ticked. (M. Kornmesser/ESO via AP)  CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Death definitely becomes this star.  Astronomers reported Wednesday on a massive, distant star that exploded in 2014 — and also, apparently back in 1954. This is one supernova that refuses to bite the cosmic dust, confounding scientists who thought they knew how dying stars ticked.  The oft-erupting star is 500 million light-years away — one light-year is equal to 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion kilometers) — in the direction of the Big Bear constellation. It was discovered in 2014 and, at the time, resembled your basic supernova that was getting fainter.  But a few months later, astronomers at the California-based Las Cumbres Observatory saw it getting brighter. They’ve seen it grow faint, then bright, then faint again five times. They’ve even found past evidence of an explosion 60 years earlier at the same spot.  Supernovas typically fade over 100 days. This one is still going strong after 1,000 days, although it’s gradually fading.  The finding was published Wednesday in the journal Nature .  “It’s very surprising and very exciting,” said astrophysicist Iair Arcavi of the University of California, Santa Barbara who led the study. “We thought we’ve seen everything there is to see in supernovae after seeing so many of them, but you always get surprised by the universe. This one just really blew away everything we thought we understood about them.”  The supernova — officially known as iPTF14hls — is believed to have once been a star up to 100 times more massive than our sun. It could well be the biggest stellar explosion ever observed, which might explain its death-defying peculiarity.  It could be multiple explosions occurring so frequently that they run into one another or perhaps a single explosion that repeatedly gets brighter and fainter, though scientists don’t know exactly how this happens.  One possibility is that this star was so massive, and its core so hot, that an explosion blew away the outer layers and left the center intact enough to repeat the entire process. But this pulsating star theory still doesn’t explain everything about this supernova, Arcavi said.  Harvard University’s astronomy chairman, Avi Loeb, who was not involved in the study, speculates a black hole or magnetar — a neutron star with a strong magnetic field — might be at the center of this never-before-seen behavior. Further monitoring may better explain what’s going on, he said.  Las Cumbres , a global network of robotic telescopes, continues to keep watch.  Scientists do not know whether this particular supernova is unique; it appears rare since no others have been detected.  “We could actually have missed plenty of them because it kind of masquerades as a normal supernova if you only look at it once,” Arcavi said.  Nothing lasts forever — not even this super supernova.  “Eventually, this star will go out at some point,” Arcavi said. “I mean, energy has to run out eventually.”",5.0,1,[5.0]
1540,3208,11,8,2017,2017-11-08,Vox,CBO: 13 million more uninsured if you repeal Obamacare’s individual mandate,"Repealing Obamacare’s individual mandate would lead to 13 million fewer Americans having health insurance and save the federal government $338 billion in the next 10 years.  The numbers come from a new report from the Congressional Budget Office, which re-scored the repeal as Republicans consider including it in their tax reform proposal as a means of saving money — and striking a blow to the health care law they’ve campaigned against but haven’t quite been able to undo. (President Trump is also reportedly considering an executive order that would defang the mandate.)  Four million more Americans would be uninsured in 2019, the first of the mandate’s repeal, with the uninsured figure increasing over the next decade to 13 million in 2027.  The mandate requires every American to have health insurance or pay a penalty. It’s the Affordable Care Act’s incentive for young and healthy people to buy insurance. Without it, healthier people would be expected to drop out of the market, which then increases insurance premiums. The CBO estimated premiums on the marketplaces would go up 10 percent if the mandate were repealed.  So the net effect of repealing the mandate is: fewer people insured, higher insurance premiums — but savings for the federal government.  The budget office had previously estimated that repealing the mandate would lead to 15 million fewer people having insurance and $416 billion in federal savings. These new numbers, which were updated to use a summer 2017 baseline for evaluating its repeal, represent a relatively modest change.  But they could mean a lot for the Republican tax reform dreams.  The new CBO numbers are a big deal for the GOP’s tax bill  The CBO’s revised estimate will have a dual effect on the Republican tax plan, if Congress decides to add the mandate’s repeal to their legislation.  First, repealing the mandate does save money because fewer people are projected to be enrolled in Medicaid and Obamacare’s insurance marketplaces. Those savings — $338 billion, under the new estimate — would be very useful to Republicans if they decided to add the mandate’s repeal to their tax plan.  Under the Senate’s “budget reconciliation” rules, the tax legislation can increase the federal deficit by $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years — and not a dollar more. The House tax bill currently hits that target exactly. It would be hard to make any further changes to the bill that reduce revenue or increase spending.  But by putting the mandate repeal in the tax bill, suddenly Congress would have another $340 billion to play with while tweaking their plan. They could cut rates for businesses and individuals even more, increase some tax deductions and tax credits, or otherwise spend more money in their bill in a way they can’t right now.  It’s a less little wiggle room than they had under the CBO previous estimate — $338 billion versus $416 billion — but the mandate would still provide hundreds of billions of dollars for the tax overhaul at a time when Republicans are struggling to find money.  However, Republicans would then open up their tax overhaul to accusations that it cuts health care coverage in order to cut taxes for the wealthy and corporations. Those attacks helped sink the GOP’s various Obamacare repeal plans in the Senate, where 50 of the 52 Republican senators must back the tax legislation under budget reconciliation.  The CBO has now provided a fresh attack line: A $1.5 trillion corporate tax cut is paid for by 13 million Americans losing health coverage.  Senate Republicans are already divided on this issue. Some, like Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Ted Cruz of Texas, want to do what Trump asks and repeal the mandate in the tax bill. But Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), who has already voted down three Obamacare repeal bills, told reporters this week that mixing health care with taxes “may be unnecessarily complicating things.”  The CBO’s mandate estimates have been controversial  The mandate — and the CBO’s estimates of its effects — has been a flashpoint over the past year. Republicans have accused the budget office of overstating exactly how much the mandate actually affects the insurance market.  “The CBO way overstates the power of Obamacare’s individual mandate to drive people to buy health insurance,” Avik Roy, one of the major proponents of the repeal bills that Congress considered earlier this year, told me back in May.  Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), as he sought to build support for his Obamacare repeal plan with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) this fall, devoted the opening minutes of a briefing with reporters in September to dispelling the agency’s projections about the mandate.  Other conservatives have also urged the CBO to make its methodology about the mandate’s effects publicly available.  It’s a wonky, sometimes inscrutable debate, but an important one. The projected coverage losses for the various Obamacare repeal plans — upward of 20 million — are a big reason why those bills failed in the Senate. If Republicans decide to repeal the mandate in their tax bill, you’re assured of seeing the “XX million lose coverage” attack from Democrats now that the CBO has updated its estimates.  A more significant update could be coming. The CBO did meet in September to discuss revising its methods for estimating the mandate’s impact, I’m told. The agency said in its release Wednesday that it was in the process of reevaluating its model.  But these new numbers do not reflect any new methodology. They simply update the baseline for projecting the mandate’s effects.  So for now, these new CBO numbers are most important for the Republican tax overhaul — and could determine whether they try to add Obamacare repeal to the equation.",4.25,2,"[4.5, 4.0]"

1568,3237,11,8,2017,2017-11-08,Vox,“Climate change” and “global warming” are disappearing from government websites,"After a year of the Trump administration, one of the most distinctive changes we’ve seen across the government is the removal of language around climate change on government websites.  It’s happened not just at agencies that deal directly with the issue like the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy, but also at the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health and Human Services.  While largely superficial, these changes in wording are symptomatic of broader shifts of the Trump era occurring within federal agencies that are trying to boost fossil fuels and roll back efforts to study, mitigate, and adapt to climate change.  The Environmental Data & Governance Initiative, a watchdog group, has been tracking many of these deletions. And this week it reported that the removal of “climate change” and related terms as well as entire pages on the issue could have a real impact on policy. For instance, they note that EPA’s removal of the website describing Obama’s signature climate policy, the Clean Power Plan, could influence the administration’s efforts to repeal it.  “The removal of the EPA’s Clean Power Plan website in advance of the Plan’s proposed repeal, obscuring compiled state emission policy information from those interested in researching the Plan, is one example of how democratic policymaking is undermined,” the authors wrote.  In some cases, the removal of references to climate change is a political directive from new Trump appointees — what some scientists have described as censorship. In other cases, agency staffers are tweaking program names and language in internal documents to try to stay out of the crosshairs of their new bosses. In other words, out of sight, out of mind, and maybe out of range for budget cuts.  For instance, EDGI found that the DOE Energy Information Administration’s Energy Kids page was altered to play up fossil fuels and play down climate change, while the EPA’s “Student’s Guide to Climate Change” was unlinked from its main page and buried on its site. A separate report from EDGI released Wednesday showed that the section on climate change was removed from the Bureau of Land Management’s website.  Though there doesn’t seem to be a systematic effort to delete “climate change” and “global warming” from all government websites, programs, or internal documents, interviews with agency staffers and watchdogs combined with news reports suggest it keeps happening. For its part, EDGI says it doesn’t “assess​ ​any​ ​agency​ ​or​ ​entity’s​ ​intentions​ ​or​ ​rationale​ ​for​ ​the​ ​demonstrated​ ​changes​.” Here’s a list — that’s by no means exhaustive — broken down by agency.  Department of Energy  In June 2017, the agency closed down its Office of International Climate and Technology, the only division with the word “climate” in its name. But before it closed, agency staff were trying to change the office’s name to protect it. ""It is absolutely true that prior to inauguration but after the election, the Office of International Climate Change Policy and Technology was seeking to change its name to remove 'climate,'"" Graham Pugh, a career staffer who led the office until 2014, told E&E News. ""The drill is you change 'climate change' to 'competitiveness.'""  Jennifer Bowen, an associate professor at Northeastern University, reported in August that she was asked to remove the words “global warming” and “climate change” from a research grant application she submitted to the Energy Department. Officials have denied that there is any policy banning the use of these phrases.  The Trump transition team in December 2016 sent and then disavowed a questionnaire to the US Department of Energy asking for names of personnel who attended international climate discussions.  A career staffer told This American Life’s David Kestenbaum that she and other workers went through internal documents shortly after the election to reframe justifications for programs from climate change to “weather” and “jobs.”  Department of Health and Human Services  The Environmental Data and Governance Initiative, which is monitoring government websites, reported in August that the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, which is part of the US Department of Health and Human Services, removed language on climate change from a webpage.  The institute “altered​ ​climate change​ ​language,​ ​updated​ ​climate​ ​change​ ​references,​ ​and​ ​reduced​ ​access​ ​to​ ​a​ ​Web resource​ ​with​ ​information​ ​on​ ​climate​ ​change​ ​and​ ​human​ ​health​ ​across​ ​several webpages,” the EDGI found.  Department of Transportation  In February 2017, the Federal Highway Administration renamed its ""Sustainable Transport and Climate Change"" team the ""Sustainable Transportation and Resilience"" team.  A spokesperson told E&E News that ""the team name was changed to more accurately reflect our emphasis on our resilience activities which constitute a large portion of our portfolio of work.""  Environmental Protection Agency  In April 2017, the Environmental Protection Agency announced website changes to remove “outdated language” and noted that “content related to climate and regulation is also being reviewed.” The words “climate” and “climate change” were then removed from EPA websites, such as those for state, local, and tribal governments.  “We are constantly updating our website to reflect new initiatives and projects of the Agency,” an EPA spokesperson wrote in an email. “Of course the site will be reflective of the current administration’s priorities — with that said, all the content from the previous administration is still easily accessible and publicly available through the banner across the top of the main page of the site.”  EPA scientists reported in October that they were blocked without explanation from attending a conference to present their work on climate change.  “It’s definitely a blatant example of the scientific censorship we all suspected was going to start being enforced at EPA,” John King, a professor of oceanography at the University of Rhode Island, told the New York Times.  An EPA staffer who asked not to be named tells Vox that language in internal documents describing a program’s work on “climate change” was changed to “climate resiliency” to protect the program from potential politically motivated cuts.  Department of the Interior  A group of scientists reported in May 2017 that the US Department of the Interior objected to climate change references in a news release about a study they published on coastal flooding.  “While we were approving the news release, they had an issue with one or two of the lines,” Sean Vitousek, a research assistant professor at the University of Illinois Chicago, told the Washington Post. “It had to do with climate change and sea-level rise.”  In October 2017, a scientist at Interior who worked on climate change resigned and filed a whistleblower complaint. Joel Clement, who studied the impact of rising seas on Native American tribes, was involuntarily reassigned to a division that collects royalties from fossil fuel leases.  ""They are clearly not going to address the climate change issue at all there and my voice is far more useful outside the agency than in it,"" Clement told CNN. ""I'm not shocked. I'm discouraged. This kind of thing is not surprising anymore and I guess that's the most discouraging thing about it, it was a clear pattern.""  Department of Agriculture  Another example we saw in Michael Lewis’s article in Vanity Fair last year was Brian Klippenstein, who led the Trump transition team for the USDA, gunning for people working on climate change as soon as he arrived.  Klippenstein previous ran a group called Protect the Harvest, which lobbies against groups like the Humane Society and raises awareness about “threats posed by animal rights groups and anti-farming extremists.”  “He came in and wanted to know all about the office on climate change,” a former USDA employee told Lewis. “That’s what he wanted to focus on. He wanted the names of the people doing the work.”  Agency staffers declined to give up names and tried to stay out of the spotlight by changing how they framed their work, as shown in an email signaling changes in messaging.  The email exchange, first obtained by the Guardian, provided guidance for how officials should rebrand their work. “Soil carbon sequestration” was to be reframed as “building organic matter in the soil to improve soil health,” for example.  The removals are pretty minor, but they reflect a broader change in attitude toward climate  It’s difficult to tell how many of these changes stem from self-preservation among career staff in government versus directives from political operatives, but for the latter, there doesn’t seem to be a strategy behind the changes.  It’s not a way to insulate the agencies from litigation, for example, since they are held to their obligations in statutes, not what’s written on their websites.  “I think it’s much more of a 1984-ish thought control motivation,” said David Doniger, director of climate and clean air program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “They don’t want the EPA website to pop up when middle school and high school kids are doing their research on climate change.”  Researcher Victoria Herrmann also reported in March that Arctic data sets and policy documents were being deleted from government websites.  “Each defunct page is an effort by the Trump administration to deliberately undermine our ability to make good policy decisions by limiting access to scientific evidence,” she wrote at the Guardian.  Many agencies still retain robust information on climate change science and policy. But leaders are ignoring it.  The removals listed here are most likely a patchwork attempt to remove inconvenient references to climate change that contradict the policies of the Trump administration. But it’s not hard to find plenty of language that still acknowledges humanity’s impact on the climate and the imperative to combat it.  Go to the DOE site and you will find this: “Addressing the effects of climate change is a top priority of the Energy Department. As global temperatures rise, wildfires, drought, and high electricity demand put stress on the nation’s energy infrastructure.”  Though the EPA’s climate change landing page is down for updates, it still maintains a website for climate change indicators like storms, wildfires, and rising temperatures.  “Many of these observed changes are linked to the rising levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in our atmosphere, caused by human activities,” the website reads.  And yet executive branch officials have shown they are quite capable of ignoring their own agencies’ high-quality science.  EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, for example, told USA Today that he would not change course in undoing greenhouse gas regulations in the Clean Power Plan despite the White House’s release last year of the Climate Science Special Report, which found that “human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming.”  The report received input from 13 federal agencies, including the EPA, the DOE, Interior, and Transportation.  ""Does this report have any bearing on that? No it doesn’t,” Pruitt said. “It doesn’t impact the withdrawal and it doesn’t impact the replacement.""  Similarly, Kathleen Hartnett White, who was renominated to lead the White House’s Council on Environmental Quality, told lawmakers at her confirmation hearing that the climate assessment wouldn’t guide any of her work.",4.333333333333333,3,"[4.5, 4.5, 4.0]"

Has HILARIOUS Response To Dinesh D’Souza’s Tweet About Donna Brazile Fearing For Her Life For Crossing Hillary ,"In her new book “Hacks”, Donna Brazile expressed concern for her safety after DNC staffer’s mysterious murder:  I felt some responsibility for Seth Rich’s death. I didn’t bring him into the DNC, but I helped keep him there working on voting rights. With all I knew now about the Russians’ hacking, I could not help but wonder if they had played some part in his unsolved murder.  But Brazile says she had a “spook,” with connections to the intelligence community, who told her after the killing that she needed protection for herself, including cameras, alarms and backup power at her house, and that she heeded his advice.

She asked Clinton to use some of the millions of dollars the campaign had in order to set up a reward fund to find his murderer. But Hillary said she “really had to go.”  I knew the campaign had over $3 million set aside in a legal fund. Could she help me get this lawsuit started?

From Washington to Maine, New Jersey to North Carolina, Trumpist ugliness was met and vanquished, sometimes by the very targets of right-wing scorn.  In January, a local New Jersey Republican politician, John Carman, mocked the anti-Trump Women’s March by asking on Facebook whether the protest would be “over in time for them to cook dinner.” That so upset Ashley Bennett, a 32-year-old health care worker, that she challenged Mr. Carman for his seat on the Atlantic County Board of Chosen Freeholders. “Elected officials shouldn’t be on social media mocking and belittling people who are expressing their concerns about their community and the nation,” she said during her campaign. If Mr. Carman does it again, it will be as a private citizen. Ms. Bennett defeated him on Tuesday.

1548,3216,11,8,2017,2017-11-08,Breitbart,All the Experts Who Told Us Stocks Would Crash if Trump Won,"There really never has been anything like it in the lifetime of practically anyone who still treads upon the earth.  In the year since Donald Trump’s upset electoral victory over Hillary Clinton, the stock market has soared to record-breaking heights. No first-term president has overseen a post-election market rally this strong since people were singing, “Happy Days are Here Again” after the election of Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1932.  But even more remarkable than the Trump rally itself has been the delicious comeupance of so many market pundits, Wall Street analysts, and economists who had announced before the election that a Trump victory would crash the market, prove instantly ruinous to the economy, and produce any number of terrible financial consequences. We may never know exactly what caused the poobahs to warn that we risked vengence of the Gods of the Market by voting for Trump. Most likely it was some combination of solipisism (they didn’t like Trump, so they figured the market wouldn’t), economic ideology (free traders always think markets will crash without their policies), and class bias (they heard the people singing the songs of angry men and worried that people would not be slaves again).  Some of us had argued before the election that the predictions of doom were badly off-base. If Trump were elected it would indicate that a substantial number of Americans believed that we really could “make American great again.” Surely that itself would provide a boost to investor sentiment, consumer sentiment, business sentiment, and the true and objective measure of those things, the stock market.  The Trump crash never even had the courtesy to stay around for a full day. After an initial slide in futures markets in the middle of the night, once it became clear Trump had won, stocks rose relentlessly. All three major stock indexes—the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq —rose on Nov. 9. Since then, stocks have been on a massive run. The Dow is up nearly 29 percent, the S&P 500 up by just over 30 percent, and the Nasdaq by 21 percent.  If the anti-Trump fearmongering were just a harmless fad–the market intellectual’s version of pet rocks or fidget spinners–we could afford to let it slip down the memory hole. But it is important to memorialize the errors of the pre-election pundits, if only to remind ourselves that many of those self-styled wise men got the most important story of our era so badly wrong. After all, some of the worst of the bunch are still out there predicting doom and gloom from Trump’s policies.  So here is a rogues gallery of those who said the rally was impossible and boldly predicted the crash that was never to materialize.  Mark Cuban. “I can say with 100 percent certainty that there is a really good chance we could see a huge, huge correction,” Cuban told CNN. “That uncertainty potentially as the president of the United States — that’s the last thing Wall Street wants to hear.”  “I can say with 100 percent certainty that there is a really good chance we could see a huge, huge correction,” Cuban told CNN. “That uncertainty potentially as the president of the United States — that’s the last thing Wall Street wants to hear.” Erik Jones. “ You would see incredible pressure on stock prices if Trump wins and everyone flooding into rare metals like gold and into bonds” in the U.S., Germany and the United Kingdom, Erik Jones, professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, told Politico’s Ben White.

1545,3213,11,8,2017,2017-11-08,Breitbart,"One Year Later, Trump Making History on Judges and Supreme Court","Donald J. Trump made such bold promises regarding the type of federal judges and Supreme Court justices he would appoint as president that his detractors said he must be pandering. One year later, President Trump has the most consistent record of nominating only originalists to the federal bench of any modern president.  President Trump has made 56 nominations thus far to the federal courts to fill the 166 current and upcoming vacancies on the bench, with more coming soon. Those nominees are the most consistently and provably conservative picks of any president since the courts became a political issue more than a half-century ago.  There is not been a conservative majority on the Supreme Court since 1934—more than 80 years. Since that time, the Court has gone back and forth between right-leaning moderate, moderate, left-leaning moderate, liberal, and very liberal. Never conservative.  Federal judges are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, then serve for life. Conservatives say that the only legitimate way for unelected and politically unaccountable judges to interpret the Constitution and lesser laws in America’s democratic form of government is according to the original public meaning of their words. Those who hold to this belief are called originalists.  After eight decades of the Supreme Court’s deviating from the original meaning of the Constitution, the federal government has exploded in size and scope, blurring the Constitution’s separation of powers, undermining its checks and balances, and violating its guarantees of the role government plays in the lives of American citizens.  Donald Trump understood that. After the sudden passing of the iconic Justice Antonin Scalia, candidate Trump promised that if elected, he would nominate judges in the mold of Scalia.  Given that Trump did not have any background in law or a long public record of supporting conservative judges, critics balked. They considered it playing to the GOP base for votes.  Trump responded by working with the Federalist Society, which is the flagship conservative legal organization in the United States dedicated to originalism, and the Heritage Foundation, one of the premiere conservative think tanks in America, to develop a list from which he would choose Scalia’s successor.  That list was a who’s-who of conservative legal leaders in the country, all but one of them a sitting judge. Critics said it was too good to be true, and latched onto every word of Trump’s off-the-cuff speaking style to parse each sentence, concluding that he left himself wiggle room to deviate from that list if he won. They insisted he would bargain away Scalia’s seat for a moderate, “consensus” candidate (there is no such thing these days) in exchange for some legislative accomplishment.  Trump pounded away on the issue of the courts right up to Election Day. Never before in American politics has the Supreme Court—and all other federal courts under it—been such a central issue in a race for the White House.  Then on November 8, 2016, Trump was elected the 45th president of the United States. Polling data showed that for 21 percent of voters, the Supreme Court was the #1 issue that determined their vote. Those voters went for Trump 57 percent to 41 percent, a potent plus-16-point issue for the Republican nominee, helping to propel the business mogul to the White House.  As head of state, President Trump has blown the doors off the hinges when it comes to judicial nominees. He successfully appointed Justice Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, a spectacularly well-credentialed legal genius who may actually be slightly to the right of the beloved Justice Scalia, more in the mold of Justice Clarence Thomas.  But President Trump has not stopped there. Instead, his White House counsel and Department of Justice has continued to consult with experts from the Federalist Society and Heritage Foundation to identify committed originalists for every seat on the 13 U.S. courts of appeals. They have also insisted on rigorous screening for the seats on the 94 U.S. district courts, consulting home-state senators, but insisting on conservative credentials.  Although Democrats have tried unprecedented tactics to delay or derail these judicial nominees, the Senate has recently broken the logjam, taking the number of confirmed nominees from 7 to 13 in just one week, and promising to get all the appellate nominees on the bench by the end of 2017.  President Trump’s base is demanding that they hurry up, abolish the remaining obstacles impeding those judges, and confirm every one of the president’s picks.  Expecting at least two more Supreme Court picks during his first term, President Trump has pledged to adhere to his list going forward for additional vacancies on the High Court. It is possible he could also update the list to add one or more of the newly minted conservative legal home-runs to that list; Republicans would likely trust the president and his team—both inside the administration and outside—to use the same care they have used thus far to continue identifying jurists in the mold of Justices Scalia, Thomas, and Gorsuch.  The judges issue has proven to be one of the greatest political assets for President Trump. There is no issue the GOP base is more passionate about, and polls consistently show that moderate voters prefer judges who adhere to the Constitution and law as written, and leave policy judgments and political considerations to elected politicians. This issue favors Republicans when properly articulated.  President Trump also understands this is an instant legacy for him, recently commenting that some of the judges he is appointing now could still be on the bench 40 years from now, shaping the law for decades to come.  One year after President Trump’s historic election, the 21 percent who voted on the federal courts got exactly what they were promised.  Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

1544,3212,11,8,2017,2017-11-08,Vox,Maine Medicaid expansion isn't a sure deal,"This is the web version of VoxCare, a daily newsletter from Vox on the latest twists and turns in America’s health care debate. Like what you’re reading? Sign up to get VoxCare in your inbox here.  Maine became the first state to expand Medicaid with a ballot initiative late Tuesday night — but that effort has already come under serious threat.  The Medicaid expansion ballot passed by a double-digit margin, and would be expected to expand coverage to 70,000 to 89,000 low-income Maine residents.  This morning, however, Maine Gov. Paul LePage put out a statement saying he won't implement the expansion until the legislature figures out a way to pay for it. This isn't entirely unexpected: Maine will need to kick in a small sliver of the costs of the expansion. A state agency estimates that, once fully implemented, the Medicaid expansion will cost the state $54 million annually — but also bring in $525 million in federal dollars.  Maine still needs to figure out how to raise its share of the money; that wasn't included in the ballot initiative that passed Tuesday night. And as Emma Sandoe has explained, ""in Maine the governor has the ability to declare that there is not enough funding available and the initiative must go back to the legislature for approval within 45 days of the start of the session.""  LePage used his statement to denounce the Medicaid expansion, a program he has long criticized:  Credit agencies are predicting that this fiscally irresponsible Medicaid expansion will be ruinous to Maine’s budget. Therefore, my administration will not implement Medicaid expansion until it has been fully funded by the Legislature at the levels DHHS has calculated, and I will not support increasing taxes on Maine families, raiding the rainy day fund or reducing services to our elderly or disabled.  Now, it is true that the Maine legislature has generally supported Medicaid expansion. It has passed five separate bills to enact the program. (LePage vetoed all of them.) So it's possible the legislature will work quickly to figure out a financing plan to expand Medicaid.  But the current makeup of the Senate means there may be big road blocks ahead. A helpful reader points out that the current president of the Maine Senate is a Republican named Michael Thibodeau. Last June, he announced his run for governor to replace LePage in 2018.  Thibodeau has often been critical of previous Medicaid expansion efforts in Maine. He voted against the Medicaid expansion in 2013 and again in 2014. Here's what he told the Portland Press-Herald in 2014, when he was running for office:  In the past two years, the Legislature has looked at nearly a half dozen proposals to expand this ""free"" health care yet again to mostly able-bodied Mainers who are capable of working. We simply cannot afford it. Moreover, the over-enrollment of this program has come at the cost of elderly Mainers and those with disabilities who remain on waiting lists for vital services.  It is possible there are enough moderate Republicans in the Maine legislature to overcome Thibodeau's opposition to Medicaid expansion — but right now, it isn't a sure thing. He does not appear to be a legislator who will make sure that funding comes through from the Maine legislature. If anything, his participation in the governor's primary may pull him a bit to the right on the issue.  vox-mark VoxCare Vox's email explaining the biggest news in health care, edited by Sarah Kliff Subscribe By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy. For more newsletters, check out our newsletters page  Utah will start collecting signatures for a Medicaid ballot later this month...  With the success of the Maine ballot initiative on Medicaid, I decided to check in with another state eying a similar effort: Utah.  A group of health advocacy groups, working under the umbrella of Utah Decides Healthcare, are working toward putting the expansion on their ballot next year.  ""Poll after poll has shown support in Utah for covering this population,"" says RyLee Curtis, a spokesperson for the group. ""So we're very excited and confident we can become the 34th state to expand Medicaid.""  The Utah groups will begin gathering signatures for their ballot on November 18. They'll need to collect 113,000 signatures — the equivalent of 10 percent of the votes cast in each state Senate district during the 2016 election. They have until April to get it done.  Curtis pointed out one key difference between the Maine ballot initiative and the one they're pushing in Utah: The Utah plan has a way to pay for expansion.  It proposes a small sales tax increase, which she says would work out to an additional 3 cents of tax on a $20 purchase of items, excluding food.  Including the tax hike in the ballot initiative does create some risk. It could turn voters off from supporting the initiative. Then again, it can also prevent the situation unfolding in Maine now — where a ballot passes and there isn't a clear way for the state to pay its share of the costs.  ""We wanted this to be as solid as possible,"" Curtis says. ""Our ballot is a full piece of legislation, where the Maine ballot was just about 50 words.""  ...and Idaho also has a Medicaid ballot in the works  I also caught up with Luke Mayville, who is running the Reclaim Idaho effort, which is working to get a Medicaid expansion on the ballot in 2018, too.  The group needs to gather about 55,000 signatures spread out across the state — about 6 percent of voters in 18 different districts.  ""We decided a month ago to go for it and file the ballot,"" Mayville says. ""Now we're waiting for certification from the state attorney general, and we should have the petitions ready in early December.""  Mayville argues that the successful passage in Maine creates more momentum behind their effort.  ""Ever since we declared our intention to put this on the ballot, we've heard a lot of doubt from some influential people here in Idaho,"" he says. ""Maine, we think, enables us to answer those doubts. It's a rural, conservative-leaning state. And even though Idaho leans more conservative then Maine, we consider it highly significant that it won in Maine by almost 20 points. We have quite a bit of space there.""  Chart of the Day: High prices, not overuse, cause America's high health care spending  It's the prices, stupid. A very helpful graphic from the Commonwealth Fund is a great reminder of a fundamental truth in American medicine. We don't spend more money because we go to the doctor a lot. We spend more money because, each time we go, our prices are hugely higher.

But many of the details were lost in the crazy development of the late-night and early morning hours.  We asked our Breitbart News staff, inspired by Esquire‘s behind the scenes look into the campaigns and some of the newsrooms, to share some of their election night memories with our readers. We hope you enjoy it and encourage everyone to post their own memories on social media or in the comments below.  Happy MAGA Day!  The Run-Up  Rebecca Mansour, Senior West Coast Editor-at-Large: During a morning editorial call a few weeks before Steve left us to run the campaign, I made a comment prefaced with the words, “if Trump wins.” Steve interrupted me, “Wait. Stop. Don’t say, ‘if!’” He then launched into an impromptu St. Crispin’s Day speech, mixing in arcane history, pop culture trash talk, and a few Bannonesque poetic flourishes. At one point, I think he even referenced that ultimate symbol of a doomed endeavor: Pickett’s Charge.  That last week of the election, I was uncharacteristically optimistic. Friends and family in my home state of Michigan told me that Trump was flooding the airwaves with a brilliant two-minute ad that explained his populist and economic nationalist message. And Michigan LOVED it. It was a love letter to the Rust Belt.  Joel Pollak, Senior Editor-at-Large: The first time I really thought — fleetingly — that Trump would win was at the “Midnight Special” speech in Virginia. It was Nov. 6, the Sunday before Election Day, and the speech was supposed to start at 9:30 pm. But Trump was running late, uncharacteristically. He had already been to five other states and held four rallies that day. I was traveling with the press pool and we arrived, finally, at 12:30 am, reaching the barn in Loudon County where the crowd was waiting. And wow! They were still waiting — thousands in the barn and perhaps thousands outside. Parents were in the crowd holding their sleepy kids on their shoulders, on a school night. When I asked them why they had come, they said: “To be part of history.” That’s when I texted my wife and told her that I thought Trump might actually do this. I was skeptical again by Election Day itself. But that was one of the little glimmering moments of hope for the Trump campaign.  Michelle Moons, Reporter: After spending a month on the Trump-Pence campaign trail, witnessing firsthand an enthusiasm among Americans that defied every poll or conventional wisdom pundit, I knew something special was coming that night.  Adelle Nazarian, Reporter: Shortly before I moved to D.C., several of our colleagues were sitting at our headquarters in Los Angeles watching TV — the news blazing with Fox, CNN, and MSNBC on three screens — when one of my colleagues asked me, “There’s a gun to your head. Does Trump win, yes or no?” It took about 5 seconds for me to answer, but I said, “Yes!”  I remember traveling with Mike Pence on November 7th from Traverse City, Michigan, to Erie, Pennsylvania, where he held his final solo rally — the day before Election Day — that sealed the deal. As I, and the rest of the media, passed him on our way out of the aircraft, Pence looked at me and said, “one more.” But I knew that, in those words, his work had just begun. At the Trump-Pence joint rally in Scranton, Pennsylvania, later that evening, there was an unprecedented energy in the atmosphere.  Robert Marlow, Senior Homepage Editor: My daughter Molly called me from New York on the day before the 2016 election and told me she was very worried that Donald Trump was not going to win the presidency. I “promised” her that Trump would win. At stake was, first, a near perfect track record of keeping my promises to my children … and, second, the fate of Western Civilization.  Michael Patrick Leahy, Polling Editor: I had no doubt Trump would win. I predicted 300 electoral votes publicly late September at a speech to Williamson County Republican women. I knew he would win Michigan due to the refugee issue. The only state that would later surprise me was Wisconsin. I thought he had a chance in Minnesota due to the refugee issue as well but thought he would come up a little short due to the overwhelming liberal bias of the local media there. We later found out, Trump ended up losing the state by barely 40,000 votes.    Jeff Poor, TV Editor: After well over a decade of being in the business of monitoring radio and cable news, tolerating smug punditry was just part of the job. Earlier in the week, The Atlantic’s David Frum predicted “a scorched earth period of recrimination” for Trump supporters coming after Trump’s inevitable loss. A day before the election, MSNBC’s Steve Schmidt was advising Donald Trump on air to prepare a concession speech.  Charlie Spiering, White House Correspondent: I went shooting at a gun range with a couple of friends the weekend before the election and only one predicted that Trump was going to win in a landslide. I said it was a “High Energy” prediction but said something lame like, “anything can happen.”  I took the train to New York City on Monday after I was assigned to cover Hillary Clinton’s election night at her campaign headquarters and met up with our editorial staff at the hotel bar. I specifically remember telling Breitbart COO Jon Kahn that Trump would win Florida, Ohio, and North Carolina, but he couldn’t win the presidency without winning Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, or Michigan. I was the wet blanket at the bar that night. I had credentials to both campaign headquarters, but I was expected to cover Hillary Clinton first. My only consolation was that maybe I would personally witness history if she won.  James Delingpole: In late summer of ’16, I got a frantic call from a journalist on Britain’s glossiest magazine, Tatler. He was trying to find someone, anyone, even halfway well-known in Britain who would admit to being a supporter of Donald Trump. Clearly, he must have been desperate because, apart from Canadian media mogul Conrad Black and Viscount Monckton, about the only one he could find to quote was me. I said: “I think he gets modern culture in a way a lot of people don’t. Trump and the age have coalesced. We have reached peak liberal-left stupid. Trump stamps all over that. If you believe the defining characteristic of our age is to virtue-signal, then Trump is the anti-virtue signaller.”  Aaron Klein, Jerusalem Editor: I watched as the fake news media repeatedly smeared Donald Trump with baseless accusations regarding women while not only ignoring but actively minimizing Bill and Hillary Clinton’s actual war against women. The establishment media were going to let Hillary get away with running on a platform of empowering women even though she enabled her husband’s predatory behavior and allegedly engaged in a campaign to silence Bill’s traumatized sexual assault victims. I knew that I had to do something. And so I did.  Alex Marlow, Editor-in-Chief: Mrs. Dr. Marlow and I voted early at our Northwest Washington, D.C. polling place a couple weeks before the election. I remember waiting to cast our ballots in a seating area in the middle of a community center auditorium thinking that virtually everyone in the crowded room hated Trump, hated Breitbart, and was there to vote for the most corrupt person ever nominated for President by a major American political party, Hillary Clinton. I still couldn’t help smiling.  Election Day  Alex Marlow: Election day got off to a fast start for me. I woke up in Manhattan and started the day hosting talk radio from SiriusXM’s Rockefeller Center studios. It was an exciting election to be in New York as both campaign HQs were there. I got to interview then-candidate Trump on Breitbart News Daily, and it was a cautiously upbeat conversation, focusing mostly on his efforts to build a “yuge tent” for the Republican Party.  The consensus among the show’s guests and callers that day was that Trump would be victorious. I’m not one who frequently makes predictions, but I did state that Trump would win. I had gone through the math, and starting with a baseline of Romney’s 2012 electoral map, I thought Trump was going to hold onto North Carolina by a narrow margin and pick up Iowa, Ohio, and Florida fairly easily. That brought him to around 259 electoral votes, but, more importantly, I thought Hillary’s cap was about 279. All Trump had to do was surprise in one or two states — and there is always a surprise in one to two states — and he would become the next president. He had a lot of “outs,” while she had to hang on for dear life.  Rebecca Mansour: In our morning senior editorial call on Election Day, our editor-in-chief Alex Marlow asked us for our final assessments of the race. I surprised myself by saying, “I feel really good about Trump’s chances. I think he can do it.” That was a big turn-around for a gal who had been playing Debbie Downer for months.  Katherine Rodriguez, Pre-viral Reporter: I cast my vote around 11 am at a polling place in Randolph, New Jersey, and noticed a lot more Republicans showing up to cast their votes than Democrats based on the number of ballots being handed out. I didn’t think anything of it at the time, given that my precinct tends to lean Republican and that New Jersey as a whole is a pretty Democratic state.  James Delingpole: I had two £50 bets placed at the bookmakers on Trump to win. The odds — 3 to 1 — were pretty poor, it seemed to me, given that EVERYONE was saying Trump was going to lose. And now, here were the polls saying he didn’t have a hope of winning. At this point, a thought crossed my mind: it was just like this in the last stages of the Brexit vote. All the experts were saying, right to the last minute, that the Remainers were going to win, yet they lost. My gut was telling me this might be a re-run. I thought of how Trump had toured the country hard in the way that Nigel Farage had toured the country hard. I thought of the rapturous reception both had received at rallies, reaching the kind of people who didn’t normally vote and who might confound the pollsters. Sadly, I didn’t trust my gut enough to place another bet — which was annoying. On the last day, I could have got odds of 8 to 1.  Charlie Spiering: I went to Mass at St. Patrick’s Cathedral, prayed for our country, and ate a massive breakfast. The campaign was over. Later I went back to my hotel room and tried to get some sleep, but that was impossible.  Frances Martel, National Security Editor: Election Day was an unnaturally sunny, silent day in New Jersey. I remember being the only person at the polling station when I voted, and almost certainly the only Republican. It was eerily quiet outside and, save for a flurry of “OMG OMG” texts from friends, quiet online too. After two years of campaigns, I think everyone had just run out of things to say.  Ben Kew, Reporter: Although I remained convinced that Trump would lose, I remember seeing a memo from Breitbart editor-in-chief Alex Marlow claiming that Trump was performing better than expected in some early voting counties. This was cause for some cautious optimism.  Wynton Hall, Social Media Consultant: I’m sitting there staring at all my social media analytics dashboards, and I realize that by midday Breitbart already had the equivalent of an NFL stadium-size audience just sitting on the Facebook page. The polls were far from closing, but folks weren’t going anywhere. Breitbart Nation was in position and manning their battle stations. They machine-gunned so many shares, comments, and reactions that Breitbart beat CNN, Fox News, and the New York Times in Election Day Facebook engagement. It was incredible to watch it unfold.  (Screenshot, News Whip)  5 p.m. – 8 p.m.  Rebecca Mansour: On the evening senior editorial call, Alex was careful not to give us a false sense of optimism or pessimism. None of us knew what the outcome would be. As he had throughout the campaign, Alex kept us positive and focused. We knew that whether Trump won or lost, Breitbart would be a target.  Throughout the day, I had been texting and speaking with Jon Kahn, who was at the Trump campaign headquarters in New York City. As the polls began to close, Jon said the exit polls weren’t looking good. The Trump team was worried about Florida.  Alex Swoyer, former Political Reporter: I was surprised at the initial exit polls favorable to Hillary Clinton because they just didn’t reflect the energy I had seen from voters out on the campaign trail when I️ spent time covering Iowa, Florida, and Ohio.  Raheem Kassam, London Editor: I arrived at the Hilton in Midtown Manhattan pretty downbeat, if I’m honest. But it was the same feeling I had on the morning of June 23rd when we confounded the British and European political, corporate, and media establishments to lead the UK to an“Out” [Brexit] vote. A small gaggle of us huddled around a cash bar (yes, a cash bar!) in the Hilton, grabbing campaign paraphernalia for posterity, exchanging pleasantries about work, and wondering what our lives would look like under President Clinton.  Amanda House, Deputy Political Editor: I was our newest editor then, so figured I’d take one for the team and cover Hillary with Charlie, our White House correspondent, while I expected the rest of the Breitbart crew in NY would be celebrating a hard-fought, but ultimately lost, battle.  Getting into the Javits Center was a complete logistical nightmare. Once inside, they stuck us in the basement. The only “view” we had was whatever they piped in for us on the TV screens. As the evening progressed, the feed operator became increasingly anxious, obnoxiously changing the channel every minute or so between CNN, MSNBC, CBS, and ABC. Whenever the commentators started to say anything that wasn’t pro-Hillary it seemed — *Click* — It was time for yet another one-minute promo of Hillary tracked to either Katy Perry’s “Roar” or Sarah Bareilles’s “Brave.” I was in “I’m-With-Her”-feminism hell.  Charlie Spiering: I met up with my colleague Amanda House to cover Hillary Clinton’s election night party. Amid the chaos of security and credentialing into the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, we realized that most digital/print media was stuck in the basement with no line of sight to the stage or any of her supporters. What a joke! TV media and campaign trail press were allowed space in the arena but had to have special passes.  Breitbart News is now live at the Hillary Clinton Election night HQ pic.twitter.com/WchV3AyVua — Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) November 8, 2016  I chatted with a few reporters I knew, waiting for the election results to come in. Many reporters already had their stories written, I idly jotted down some notes as we waited. Florida came in hot, looking blue for Hillary, and the crowd of her supporters was going wild — we could hear them from the basement.  Ben Kew: I was sitting on the pool deck of a hotel in Caracas, Venezuela, speaking to some Americans. They told me they would rather live in Venezuela, a country ruined by socialism, than Trump’s America. This made me more nervous as I realized just how much was at stake. As I went back to my hotel room to follow the night’s events, I heard a Democratic strategist saying how he expected it to be a “strong night for Hillary Clinton and the Democrats.” My worst fears were realized.  Joel Pollak, from How Trump Won:  At my friend’s apartment, I lie down for a nap for exactly 15 minutes. I wake to the news that pollster Frank Luntz, citing some new numbers, has projected Hillary Clinton to be the next president of the United States. People are still voting, but the election seems over. I dress for the evening and head uptown, in a state of resignation. I spend the subway ride pondering different options for drowning my sorrows. I conclude that none of them is any good, and I may as well just do my work. I find my way to the hotel, past a few Trump supporters. The street in front of the New York Midtown Hilton is still largely empty. Walking into the building feels like going to a funeral, as people prepare to console one another.  Dan Flynn, Editor: Fresh from casting a ballot for Trump in school’s mock election, and the ensuing grief that choice caused among their fellow Massachusetts youth (try being six and the only girl casting a sans-Australian-ballot vote for Trump in a Bay State classroom), the second- and fifth-graders in my home wanted to know what state victories meant a national victory for their preferred candidate. My children believe in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy, so, as a seasoned writer on politics who knew better than to put much stock in a Trump victory, I played along and told them he needed to win North Carolina to retain a chance and that, if he won Wisconsin, Clinton held no chance.  Alex Marlow: I was working the front page at Breitbart.com and tracking three things at this time: 1) Smug media-types embarrassing themselves on various social platforms. 2) I had a keen eye on Florida, where the polls closed at 7 p.m. Early returns showed Trump well ahead, but then he seemed to plummet. I led our evening editorial call, showered, got dressed, and headed into SiriusXM’s studios for our nighttime simulcast for The Patriot Channel 125 and Breitbart.com. I checked my phone while walking and saw that Trump had retaken the lead in the Sunshine State. That’s when things got fun. 3) It was around this time I found — and subsequently became obsessed with — a Reuters exit poll that revealed unprecedented disdain for both the political and media establishments among the electorate (the post has over 77,000+ comments). I plastered the data all over our front page, and we were immediately heckled by blue checkmarks, who suggested we were living in an alternate reality. Their laughter soon turned to tears. The highlights from the poll:  – 75 percent agree that “America needs a strong leader to take the country back from the rich and powerful.” – 72 percent agree “the American economy is rigged to advantage the rich and powerful.” – 68 percent agree that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me.” – 76 percent believe “the mainstream media is more interested in making money than telling the truth.”  8 p.m. – 11 p.m.  Alex Marlow: I broadcast live with David Webb, Andrew Wilcow, and guests from SiriusXM’s glass studio known as the “fishbowl” in front of a small live audience. I provided news updates, while they supplied the color commentary. I was frantically refreshing browsers on a couple monitors for up-to-the-second updates. When Ohio turned into a blowout, the atmosphere became electric. The most compelling data to chart was the New York Times’ election forecaster which provided real-time betting odds on who would win. At the start of the day, it had Clinton at 85 percent.  Wynn Marlow, Associate Political Editor: My daughter Molly and I took a cab to the Hilton Hotel, NYC, to attend the gathering optimistically called the Trump Victory Party. It was around 8:30 p.m. The street was closed to traffic and the security detail itself exuded excitement. We were escorted to an enormous ballroom where the press was allowed to congregate. Women for Trump posters were on the tables. MAGA hats were distributed to one and all. There were huge TV screens hanging, tuned to Fox News. Oddly, there were no chairs at all. Reporters stood at small pedestal tables with their laptops. There was a cash bar at one end of the room. No surprise, perhaps, that the Breitbart contingent ended up congregating on the floor, against a pillar, next to the bar. Milo was there with his entourage. CEO Larry Solov and COO Jon Kahn came over from Trump Tower where the campaign was waiting for the returns. Matt Boyle bounced around the room in his MAGA hat. Everyone wore big smiles amid the excitement of the moment, the supreme sense of historical significance.  Raheem Kassam: Just like Brexit, the atmospheres were similar as the nights wore on: sore feet, sore heads, and glances of disbelief at friends and acquaintances. Not a word had to be exchanged in those moments. As eyes locked, both parties quizzically but clearly conveyed the voiceless words: “Are you seeing what I’m seeing? Am I going crazy? Have we actually done this?”  Charlie Spiering: At 8:30 p.m., Debbie Wasserman Schultz was spotted at Clinton HQ, and reporters scrambled to ask her about Florida. “The jury’s still out,” she said, looking nervous. Maybe it wasn’t going to be a short night after all. By 9:00 p.m. everything had changed, reporters stopped talking, laughing, and waiting and started getting anxious watching election results come in. The cheering upstairs had dampened.  Media mood at Hillary HQ just got a whole lot more serious pic.twitter.com/0YCFyheYyv — Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) November 9, 2016  Shortly after 10:00 p.m., Hillary Clinton was called the winner of Virginia, prompting wild cheers from supporters although the tide was turning the opposite direction. Amanda and I agreed it was time to leave and make our way to the Trump headquarters. As we left, we could see everyone inside the glass box building, literally trapped in a glass cage of emotion.  Amanda House: When Team Hillary cut all news programming in the media room to run a four-minute “History of Hillary Clinton” video, I knew something was up. I checked twitter and, sure enough, the markets had turned. The globe was watching. The Democrats, the NeverTrumpers, the world had placed their bets on Hillary, and, as the reporter from one of our alphabetical news outlet neighbors, Black Enterprise, whispered to her colleague, “It [was] not looking good.”  Charlie and I were refreshing the NYT election tracker, trying to get a better sense of what was really happening outside. Hillary started out the day with an 85 percent chance of winning. By 9:30 p.m., Trump was at 51 percent, Clinton 49. Hillary had tweeted something ominous a few minutes earlier about “ whatever happens tonight, thank you for everything.” By 10 p.m., the DOW was plunging. A few minutes later, I saw reports online that Hillary’s campaign was on “lockdown. As they were throwing Katy Perry on the stage, I remember telling Charlie, “As soon as Florida or Virgina go, we’re leaving.”  They were both nail bitters, but Virginia was called soon thereafter for Hillary. The NYT tracker had jumped to something like 90 percent for Trump though. At that point, I thought, “It’s done. No one wants to call it yet, but he’s won Florida.” It was done. And from our labeled “BREITBART” desk, I could feel everyone’s eyes on us. I could no longer see our friends from the Daily Caller. Hillary’s HQ was in full meltdown. I knew it was time to get out of there.  Joel Pollak, from How Trump Won:  This is Game 7, all right. Now, somehow, I find myself calming down. I am in Cubs mode. Instead of watching the television—which I could do anywhere—I decide to work, to write about the mood swings and the tension in the air. And as I do so, I feel just a little glimmer of that familiar feeling, that sense I had in the Armory Ballroom in New Hampshire, the feeling that Trump is going to win. I quickly suppress the thought. He is still likely to lose. It would be nice, looking back, to have believed in a win, this late in the game. But it seems impossible.  Frances Martel: I had been going on about Trump having what it takes to win since easily 2012, but now, it was impossible to imagine the reality of a President Donald Trump. Somehow, “President Hillary Clinton” sounded even less likely.  Dan Flynn: A strange thing happened: events vindicated naivety and mocked expertise. Brett Baier calling North Carolina for Trump elicited a reaction similar to that which greeted Al Michaels calling Malcolm Butler’s interception. Thousands of pounds of house shook as only hundreds of pounds of kid could make it (surely the funeral-home-quiet abodes that surrounded heard, nay, felt the ruckus). This would repeat later in the evening with Wisconsin (and, truth be told, other states that I did not think of as barometers), and Rachel Maddow’s unintentionally-amusing sulfur-face acted as the substitute for Richard Sherman’s horrified, televised frown from two years earlier.  Alex Swoyer: I remember being certain Donald Trump would come out on top when Florida was tied with only the panhandle left to be counted. Trump had massive support in that area and throughout the gulf coast states.  Alex Marlow: Watching the NYT tracker go from 85 percent Clinton to >95 percent Trump was one of the great pleasures of my life.  F L O R I D A pic.twitter.com/xqe0OqjqOO — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) November 9, 2016  11 p.m. – 1 a.m.  Alex Marlow: After our live coverage ended, I left SiriusXM and walked uptown through Manhattan toward my Central Park South hotel and it was, as others have said, much like the zombie apocalypse (I’m a zombie movie superfan). The quiet was surreal. A Trump victory was inevitable at this point, but I was mostly in “work mode,” so I was not yet in a celebratory mindset. It was a privilege to be the caretaker of Breitbart.com at such a historic moment, and I was savoring it.  Jeff Poor: Throughout the night, The New York Times had a dial prognosticating which way the election would go — for Hillary or Trump. Once that dial passed the “tossup” category and moved to “leaning” toward Trump early in the evening, I knew Frum, Schmidt, and all the others forecasting a Hillary Clinton landslide were going regret their earlier prognostications. And that turned out to be the case.  Neil Munro, Editor: I got to the White House around 12:00 a.m. and the plaza at Lafayette Square was jammed with a mass of young people, some cheering, some shouting, most just watching. An allied mob of Islamic advocates, Black Lives Matter, and left-wingers snaked its way into and around the crowd, endlessly and pointlessly shouting “F*** Donald Trump, F*** Donald Trump.” One Trump supporter pushed himself into the middle of the Trump-haters and grinned from ear to ear as they yelled in his face. Bernie Sanders’ supporters stood around mournfully. The most bizarre behavior came from a few handfuls of wealthy female students who loudly wailed and wept, so manipulating their male friends to serve as resentful bodyguards for a public display of female anger and power.  Katherine Rodriguez: I had checked the electoral college map on Politico one last time before heading to bed, seeing Hillary ahead but not by much as Trump gained momentum. I was cautiously optimistic that I would not wake up to a “President Hillary Clinton” the next morning, but I expected the worst.  Charlie Spiering: When we finally got through security and into Trump Election HQ, Wisconsin was called for Trump. That’s when I knew it was real. The party atmosphere turned into a roar. People wearing red MAGA hats bought beers from the cash bar and began shouting, high-fiving, and chanting, “TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP!” I snapped pictures with my Breitbart colleagues and slipped into the crowd directly in front of the stage. Fox News was being broadcast live and people were cheering and jeering the media as the election night rolled on. I spotted several campaign aides and even Sen. Jeff Sessions wading through the crowd, shaking hands and greeting supporters who were by the stage. I was witnessing history.  A friend spotted me in this AP photo of election night. It perfectly captures what I was feeling:  Another friend texted me to say, “I am so drunk, I want this done!”  Amanda House: The evening dragged on forever. Some of us were sitting on the ground near the bar — tired, anxious, and double checking our math. At some point, I remember seeing Canada’s immigration site had crashed. This was really happening. At this point, it seemed like it was Hillary who needed the miracle.  Joel Pollak, from How Trump Won:  Underneath my dress shirt, I am wearing a t-shirt bearing the face of Andrew Breitbart. I am not going to reveal it unless Trump is winning decisively. I begin to think about when: Wisconsin, or Michigan. I send some encouraging text messages to my wife. I watch the monitors, which are tuned to Fox News. The conservative network is showing the tense, bewildered scene at the Clinton party at the Jacob K. Javits Center. I keep ignoring those who say Trump is going to win—including the Times, which is now putting the probability of a Trump victory above 90 percent. Then, suddenly, Wisconsin is called. “It’s over,” I tell the people near me, as I remove my tie, and bare my Breitbart t-shirt to the world.  Rebecca Mansour: One by one, Trump was winning his “must have” states. But there was still that so-called “blue wall” of states that served as Hillary’s Maginot Line. Trump would have to flip at least one of them to win. And then it happened. Wisconsin was called for Trump!  I immediately jumped in our internal Slack channel and typed: “BLUE WALL DOWN!! BLUE WALL DOWN!!” That was the moment Trump won. As goes Wisconsin, so goes Pennsylvania. And Michigan.  Michigan would officially be called for Trump a few weeks after the election. But we knew that night Trump had won there.  Wynn Marlow: As November 8 began to bleed into November 9 and the election still unresolved, the mood in the ballroom took on a slightly surreal quality. At least for me, it felt kind of out-of-body, the finish line like a shimmering mirage in the distance. I remember letting out a victory yelp when Fox announced that Wisconsin had gone for Trump. That was unexpected. That was YUGE.  Some of the Breitbart crew on election night at Trump’s Victory Party in New York City, NY.

We have reached PEAK 2016. pic.twitter.com/cnEgMULnbh — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) November 9, 2016  Michael Patrick Leahy: Around one in the morning, I started getting calls from friends who were deliriously happy. “I can’t believe you were right that Trump would win!” was the consistent message from about half a dozen friends who called me during those early morning hours.  Frances Martel: I fell asleep sometime around 2 a.m. when it seemed like it was really going to end up being Trump’s win but not quite certain yet and had what I thought was a weird dream where Trump had given a victory speech and everything!  Wynn Marlow: The networks seemed to be taking an interminable time to call state results — as though they were dragging it out on purpose. The collected body in our ballroom began to groan loudly and yell at the TVs: “Call it!”  Charlie Spiering: At 2:30 a.m., the crowd was getting impatient while watching the Fox News reports live from Trump campaign party. Everyone in the room turned around and started shouting at the anchor, “Call it! Call it! Call it!” Some saw on their phones that the Associated Press had called Pennsylvania for Trump, and they demanded that the cable networks deliver the verdict.  At 2:40 a.m., Fox News made it official.    The exhausted crowd roared when Trump went onstage with all of his campaign team. It was over.  Wynn Marlow: Joyous famous faces like Jeff Sessions and Diamond and Silk began streaming out of the VIP room in a virtual conga line toward the stage that was being prepared for the newly elected President of the United States, Donald J. Trump. We all pressed into that part of the ballroom in exhausted anticipation. And then they arrived: Trump and his family and his campaign team, including our own Stephen K. Bannon. I don’t remember a word he said. All I knew was that we won!!!  Adelle Nazarian: Watching Trump and his family enter the room after he won was unlike anything I’d ever witnessed in my life. I fell in love with my country again that night.  Michelle Moons: As I watched the results roll in and the blue wall fall, I knew the grassroots movement I had seen in more states than I could keep track of would prevail that night. And as I watched enthusiasm rise in the Trump victory party and deflate among the Clinton election night event, I thought back to the faces and words of each rally-goer I interviewed along the way, from the teens to the seniors and those who said they were voting for the first time, for Trump, for the America First president who pledged to fight for those hurt by a failing economy, rising health insurance costs, illegal immigration, and politicians who fought more for their special interests than the American people.  Amanda House: When we got reports that Hillary was not going to the Javits Center and Podesta was going instead, all I could think was, “Wow … How embarrassing.”  Ben Kew: I sat there in my hotel room in Caracas, Venezuela, watching the BBC Coverage in disbelief as the results continued to roll in.  Alex Marlow: I set the front page one last time at around 3:30 a.m. and handed it off to Robert Marlow, our night editor (and my dad). I hit the airwaves again for SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily at 6:00 a.m. Reality finally set in for me as I opened the show. I got chills announcing to our audience that Donald Trump would be the next President of the United States. I let a “Wow…” hang in the air for a few moments as our intro music played. I had never felt like I did at that moment.  If I had one regret about an otherwise perfect election day, it was that I didn’t get to spend enough time watching the contemptible media elite come to grips with the news live on air. It would have been hard to pick between Benedict ✨ Megyn ✨, Fake News CNN, far-left MSNBC, or myriad online streams from assorted NeverTrumpers and Obama Bros. It pains me to think about how much joy I missed while I was focused on work. Maybe someone will email me YouTube highlights.  Rebecca Mansour: On November 8, 2016, the Hobbits and Deplorables won. For those of us who had been fighting in the conservative trenches for years, it was a vindication.  That night, I scrolled through the comment section on our homepage and Facebook page to celebrate the moment with Breitbart readers. I was overwhelmed with gratitude toward them and astonished at what we accomplished together. It reminded me of how G.K. Chesterton described the reaction of the English victory over the Spanish Armanda or the Scots victory at Bannockburn: It was “a victory that astonished the victors.”  Jeff Poor: At 3 a.m. ET, around when most media outlets called the election for Trump, for a brief moment, there was a pause and contrition on CNN and MSNBC. That relief after years of know-it-all punditry lasted for a few hours. Then it was on to excuse-making and the next chapter of American politics.  Charlie Spiering: After waiting for a long time while Trump left the building, security finally let us out. It was past 3:00 a.m., and the bars in the area were all closed, so there was no time for additional celebrations. I walked to Trump Tower and watched as Trump fans continued to celebrate the historic night.  Ezra Dulis, Deputy Managing Editor: I don’t have very strong memories from election night, as I was just watching TV and working on a dozen tasks for the site. Looking back over the Breitbart Twitter account, it seems I had bookmarked a bunch of weird gifs from The_Donald and elsewhere to react as states were called. The final one — taken from the old Transformers cartoon — I remember was very cathartic as the race was called. “Meme magic” had won; a bunch of weirdos goofing off on social media really did have more pull than an unprecedented tidal wave of corporate propaganda.  Two words: meme magic pic.twitter.com/Ui8vYqwI4X — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) November 9, 2016  Morning After  Alex Marlow: We tend to keep it classy at Breitbart News. People were thrilled on our radio show and morning editorial calls, but we all knew we had a lot of work to do. The left and the media were going to double down, and we were already gearing up for that. We never let up. Ever. That’s our edge. That’s why we do so much winning.  Our last big front page election spread:  Aaron Klein: After three months on the campaign trail, I departed on a flight back to Tel Aviv, awed that I was able to play a role in getting out the truth and helping to shape the conversation of the race that changed the course of American history.  James Delingpole: It was like Brexit all over. Trump had won, I had won, and all the worst people really were as upset as I hoped. This was no time for magnanimity in victory. This was a time to crush my enemies, see them driven before me, hear the lamentations of their women. Soon YouTube would be filled with compilation films of tearful liberals on political comment shows and suchlike reacting to Trump’s election like it was the end of the world. Mwahahah. A beautiful new dawn had begun — and at last I felt like I was on the right side of history.  Wynton Hall: The Breitbart Facebook page was a full-blown party. No one wanted to leave; everyone wanted to comment and share.  Charlie Spiering: That morning was a blur. I hardly slept at all and finally gave up and went to Dominique Ansel to buy my wife a cronut for her birthday. When I got back, I ran into Jon Kahn at the hotel breakfast and we sat there drinking coffee while marveling at what had happened. Several members of Steve Bannon’s family arrived unexpectedly and I met them for the first time. They were very proud and excited for what was possible.  I still had to cover Hillary Clinton’s concession speech, which was pushed back for hours and my zombie mind was taking in all the reaction from cable news. After she finally spoke, I filed my last article on the historic 2016 election and ran to catch my train home.  Katherine Rodriguez: I noticed nearly half of the voters in my county went for Trump as I checked the election results the next morning. I scrolled through my Facebook feed and saw friends on both sides of the aisle either rejoicing or angry at the election results. As I checked Breitbart’s Facebook page/website, I came to the realization after seeing the insane amount of traffic on both the website and the Facebook page over the past 24 hours that I and many other writers at Breitbart played an incredible role in shaping the national conversation leading up to the election through the stories we wrote.  Robert Marlow: I praised the Lord my stellar track record of kept promises remained in tack, and there is still hope for Western Civilization.  Dan Flynn: My children always remember two particularly joyous events in my living room: Malcolm Butler intercepting a Russell Wilson pass on the goal line and Donald Trump’s similar goal-line stand against Hillary Clinton.  Frances Martel: I woke up to this picture on my phone, which I must have taken during my “dream”:  Adelle Nazarian: I fought hard to stay up to watch Hillary Clinton’s concession speech from my hotel room in Manhattan. When I saw her enter the screen around 10:30 a.m., my mind told me I should get some rest because she wasn’t going away anytime soon. It’s one year in and my prediction was spot on.  Chris Burgard, Filmmaker: When they announced that Trump was going to be the next president, my wife and I were not only elated, we weren’t surprised. However, our Hollywood producer friend who was with us was apoplectic and suddenly grey skinned. At first, she thought it was a joke. She went from disbelief to shock to horror to tears as it slowly sunk in that Hillary Rodham Clinton was not going back to the White House.  She tried to hide her anger, but the emotional storm of disdain that was brewing inside of her was palpable to everyone. The kind of uncomfortable that even really nice red wine can’t cover up. In the past year, we haven’t gotten together as much, and when we do, it is strained. But at least we still talk, which is more than I can say of some of our other Hollywood friends. People we’ve known for decades no longer speak to us because of 45. It’s so sad and yet such a great lesson in tolerance. Bless their hearts.  Raheem Kassam: When I saw the president-elect two days after the election in his Manhattan penthouse, he seemed to express the same sentiment. He actually couldn’t believe he had won. “What does this mean?” He asked a group of five of us, perched on his extra-long couch in his gaudy living room.  “So much,” I thought. “So, so much.”  Amanda House: I can’t wait to tell my grandkids.  Some New Members of the Breitbart Newsroom Share Their Experiences from November 8, 2016:  Ian Mason, DOJ and Legal Reporter: When it started to look like Trump had almost certainly won — when the lead in OH and FL looked insurmountable and WI and PA looking very good — my most distinct memory was my host saying something like, “Ian Ian, I’m excited too, but you have to stop I have neighbors below.” I hadn’t realized I’d been jumping up and down for almost a minute. It just hadn’t even occurred to me.  We knew this was really long before the announcement. I was teary-eyed for Trump’s speech, but it was Podesta coming out for Hillary that really made it sink in. A world turned upside down. They had no idea what to do. They hadn’t planned for “what happened.” That was when I knew for certain things would never be the same.  Penny Starr, Political Reporter: I may be one of the few Donald Trump supporters who didn’t stay glued to the television all night. In fact, after watching the liberal media drone on and on about how Hillary was going to win, I decided I’d rather get a good night’s sleep than listen to the talking heads. And against all odds and polls, I believed Trump would win. When I awoke, I was literally afraid to boot up my computer to find Hillary Clinton was the 45th president of the United States. But when Trump’s photo popped up, I knew the Obama administration was finally over and America might just be great again.  Kristina Wong, Pentagon Correspondent: From the minute that Florida went red, I knew I was watching something historic. Since I was not covering the election, I was at a bar in D.C., and around me was mostly gloom. I went to bed with the results inconclusive and woke up to Donald Trump being our next president! He had defied D.C. and the political class. All of the city seemed silent that day, but I remember feeling relieved and excited. The little guy — outside of D.C. — had spoken.",1.0,1,[1.0]
1498,3166,11,7,2017,2017-11-07,The New York Times,Opinion | The G.O.P. Should Be Scared by Virginia,"Although at times over the last week it seemed that Democrats were doing their damnedest to lose the Virginia gubernatorial race, they failed miserably in that endeavor, which is to say that they succeeded emphatically at the polls. Ralph Northam will be the state’s next governor.  That’s a gigantic relief, because a Northam defeat would have prompted a Democratic meltdown — and rightly so. In statewide races, Virginia is increasingly blue: Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump there by five points a year ago. And Trump’s ceaseless assault on propriety, decency and ethical, responsible government is supposedly firing up liberals as never before. Virginia on Tuesday was the place to demonstrate that.  The demonstration was impressive. Not only did Northam beat his Republican opponent, Ed Gillespie, by about nine points — a margin of victory larger than either Clinton’s or the two-point advantage that ushered the state’s current Democratic governor, Terry McAuliffe, into office four years ago — but Democrats also performed strongly in other Virginia races. So strongly, in fact, that one Democrat, Danica Roem, easily unseated a longtime Republican incumbent in the House of Delegates and will become the nation’s only openly transgender state representative. The history that she made flies squarely in the face of the bigotry and divisiveness that Trump sows.  Just when we needed a sign that his America is not all of America, Virginia came to the rescue and gave us a vivid one. And I guarantee you that the Republicans up for re-election in 2018 saw it, shuddered and will spend the next weeks and months trying to figure out just how much trouble their party is in and precisely how to repair it. Democrats are exceedingly familiar with that feeling.",4.0,2,"[3.0, 5.0]"
1492,3160,11,7,2017,2017-11-07,Vox,This hypnotizing animation shows the incredible trend of global warming,"Kevin Pluck has a cool hobby: turning climate trend data into stunning graphics.  The Manchester, England-based software engineer’s latest is an animated “barrel graph” comparing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and temperature variations relative to the average between 1951 and 1980, drawing on data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA:  The mesmerizing animation on the right helps illustrate that even with seasonal and annual variation, the overall temperature trend is upward, with temperatures rising more than 0.5 degrees Celsius above the 1951-1980 average. Meanwhile, the left-hand barrel graph shows atmospheric CO2 concentrations climbing unnervingly and steadily higher. “CO2 is just steadily growing and growing and growing,” Pluck said. “It’s so consistent and so frightening.”  The new graphics have acquired affectionate nicknames on social media. “I saw ‘death slinky,’ which I thought was great,” Pluck said.  Pluck had the idea to make the graphic after seeing this tweet showing an animation of temperature and carbon dioxide.  Carbon dioxide is added to the atmosphere and temperatures rise pic.twitter.com/VvZjmSbKCn — Robert Wilson (@planktoncounter) October 23, 2017  Then he started “thinking about old seismic drum recorders and how they looped around every 24 hours,” he told me.  It became a hobby after he made a spiral GIF of changes in global sea ice in the style of visualization work by professor Ed Hawkins’s group at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom:  “Both Reddit and Twitter loved it and went viral,” he said. “The UNFCCC posted it on their Twitter, the Daily Mail wrote a piece, and I got an email from the office of Al Gore asking for permission to use it in his presentations. It’s fair to say I was hooked.”  There are other variations on rising temperature spirals, like the funnel-shaped graph Hawkins’s group produced. Spanning more than 160 years of climate data, the animation shows temperature anomalies in the horizontal axis rather than the vertical axis.  This NASA carbon dioxide graph adds an important bit of context that Pluck’s barrel graph doesn’t show, namely that the amount of carbon dioxide humanity is pumping into the atmosphere is massive compared to natural variations:  The big picture will be on the minds of officials from around the world who are gathering in Bonn, Germany, this week to discuss climate change, the first such United Nations conference since President Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris climate accords.",4.5,1,[4.5]

A recent article in the Chronicle of Higher Education paints a positive portrait of Bray. “Mr. Bray, a 35-year-old who looks even younger than that, is neither a fire-starter or a Nazi-puncher. He is a lecturer of history at Dartmouth College. His weapons of choice are logic and history, his crisp sentences delivered with the vaguest trace of a New Jersey accent.”  The article goes on to announce that Bray will be donating half of the proceeds from his new book, Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook, will go directly to financing the efforts of Antifa groups around the country.  “As an undergraduate at Wesleyan University, Mr. Bray studied Spanish revolutionaries and began to think of himself as an anarchist,” the flattering Chronicle profile continues. “‘The struggles and sacrifices of workers and peasants to collectively shed generations of oppression and forge a truly equitable society were so beautiful,’ he wrote. ‘I knew I had to continue their struggle.'”  Earlier this year, Bray was condemned by Dartmouth College’s president over the endorsement of Antifa violence. Shortly after Bray’s endorsement of political violence, Dartmouth attempted to distance itself, writing in a statement saying “supporting violent protests do not represent the views of Dartmouth.”  In response to the college’s critique of Bray, a hoard of faculty members began to express their outrage. “Since the violent neo-Nazi attack in Charlottesville, we have watched with gratitude as our junior colleague Mark Bray, on the strength of his historical scholarship, has become the national expert on a subject that is suddenly, terribly urgent: the twentieth-century history of fascism and anti-fascism, in Europe and, more recently, the United States,” a letter from a faculty group read.  The faculty letter specifically condemned Breitbart News for inspiring Dartmouth College to condemn’s Bray’s endorsement of violence.  “The tone and content of Dartmouth’s statement takes at face value the distortions presented as truth by Farkas, Breitbart, and Daily Caller reporters, as though they were somehow more credible sources than Professor Bray himself—had anyone contacted him—or the transcripts and published pieces widely available for the College’s representatives to check for themselves,” the letter continues.  In his book, Bray writes that violence is a “vital” part of Antifa activity. “In truth, violence represents a small though vital sliver of anti-fascist activity,” Bray wrote. “Anti-fascists don’t wait for a fascist threat to become violent before acting to shut it down, physically if necessary.”",2.0,1,[2.0]

The representatives, Frank A. LoBiondo of New Jersey and Ted Poe of Texas, made their announcements within hours of each other and added their names to a growing list of Republicans bowing out before the midterm elections. The rush of retirements has led some, particularly eager Democrats, to believe that the House of Representatives could look very different in 2019.  Mr. LoBiondo, 71, who first took office in 1995, did not mention Mr. Trump in his announcement though he delivered a searing indictment on a decline in political civility, action and collegiality during his time in Congress. He bemoaned a constant polarization that discouraged opposing sides to engage in honest debates about legislation.  “As some of my closest colleagues have also come to realize, those of us who came to Congress to change Washington for the better through good governance are now the outliers,” Mr. LoBiondo, who represents South Jersey, said in his retirement statement.

1495,3163,11,7,2017,2017-11-07,Breitbart,Paradise Papers Reveal Apple’s Secret Tax Hideout,"The recently released Paradise Papers, which detail the tax affairs of some of the world’s wealthiest people, have revealed the offshore sites used by Apple to avoid paying billions in taxes.  BBC News reports that tech giant Apple began searching for a country to store their untaxed offshore cash in 2013 following a crackdown on their controversial tax practices in Ireland. Apple then moved approximately $252 billion in cash to the Channel Island of Jersey, but the company claims that this new structure has not lowered the amount of tax that they pay.  Apple still currently remains the largest taxpayer paying approximately $35 billion in corporation tax over the past three years. Apple claims that storing their funds offshore in the Channel Island of Jersey is perfectly legal and that it “did not reduce our tax payments in any country.” The company also said that no operations had been moved from Ireland.  Apple came under fire for their use of a tax loophole known as the “double Irish” in 2014, funneling all of their sales outside America through Irish subsidiaries that were essentially stateless, allowing them to pay very little tax on the revenue. Rather than paying the Irish corporation tax rate of 12.5 percent or the US rate of 35 percent, Apple managed to reduce their tax rate on profits outside the U.S. to the extent that their foreign tax payments usually amounted to less than five percent of their foreign profits.  Following an investigation by the European Commission, it was discovered that the tax rate for one of the Irish companies used by Apple for one year had been just 0.005 percent. Apple CEO Tim Cook was forced to defend the company’s tax practices in the U.S. Senate in 2o13. Senator Carl Levin told him at the time, “You shifted that golden goose to Ireland. You shifted it to three companies that do not pay taxes in Ireland. These are the crown jewels of Apple Inc. Folks, it’s not right.”  Cook responded in defense of the company saying, “We pay all the taxes we owe, every single dollar. We do not depend on tax gimmicks… We do not stash money on some Caribbean island.” The leaked Paradise Papers appear to show that two of Apple’s Irish subsidiaries, Apple Operations International (AOI), where it’s believed that Apple has stashed approximately $252 billion in overseas cash, and Apple Sales International (ASI), were managed by Appleby, a global offshore law firm, from their office in Jersey from the start of 2015 until early 2016.  Jersey, a UK Crown dependency, is in charge of creating their own tax laws and currently has a zero percent corporate tax rate for foreign companies, making it a prime location for Apple to operate their subsidiaries from. Apple declined to comment on their subsidiaries moving their tax residency to Jersey but did comment on their business situation in Ireland saying, “When Ireland changed its tax laws in 2015, we complied by changing the residency of our Irish subsidiaries and we informed Ireland, the European Commission, and the United States.”  “The changes we made did not reduce our tax payments in any country. In fact, our payments to Ireland increased significantly and over the last three years we’ve paid $1.5bn in tax there.”",4.75,2,"[5.0, 4.5]"

Not much, to the frustration of some American business executives.  Mr. Trump’s meetings this week with Xi Jinping, China’s president, and other Chinese leaders come at a difficult time for both countries. Each has been consumed with domestic issues, from West Wing infighting and a special counsel investigation in Washington to a sensitive leadership transition in Beijing.  The Trump administration in particular has been stretched thin on trade. It has been slow to fill important trade-related positions, because of distractions and the lengthy congressional confirmation process. The administration has been preoccupied with rewriting the North American Free Trade Agreement and a United States trade deal with South Korea.  Trade has also been supplanted by North Korea as the most talked-about issue in Northeast Asia for President Trump, and an issue on which he wants Chinese cooperation, not confrontation.

1493,3161,11,7,2017,2017-11-07,Fox News,US job openings flat in September as hurricanes slow hiring,"U.S. employers posted roughly the same number of open jobs in September as the previous month, partly because hurricanes held back hiring at restaurants and hotels.  The Labor Department said Tuesday that 6.09 million jobs were available at the end of September, not far from the record high of 6.14 million reached in July. The number of open jobs in restaurants and hotels fell 111,000 from August. That reflects widespread damage in the wake of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which struck many vacation spots in Texas, Florida and other southeastern states.  Overall, thousands of businesses were closed, which likely held back hiring. Total hires fell 2.7 percent to 5.27 million in September, the lowest in five months.  Excluding the storms' impact, the job market remains mostly healthy. The government said last week that employers added 261,000 jobs in October. That partly reflected a recovery in hiring after the hurricanes dragged down job gains in September.  October's figure is a net gain after layoffs, quits and retirements are subtracted from overall hiring. Tuesday's data is from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey, or JOLTS. They are more detailed and provide a fuller view of the job market than the monthly jobs report.  The two reports paint a picture of employers struggling to fill jobs in tight labor market. The unemployment rate fell to 4.1 percent in October, the lowest in 17 years.  Employers have a dwindling pool of those out of work to choose from. There were just 1.12 unemployed people, on average, for every open job in September. During the 2008-2009 Great Recession, that figure reached 6 unemployed people for every available job.  When employers are desperate to hire, they typically offer higher pay to find and keep employees. Yet a variety of data suggests that wages are rising slowly. Hourly pay rose just 2.4 percent in October from a year earlier, the government said Friday.  The last time the unemployment rate was as low as it is now, pay was increasing at about 4 percent a year.  Americans are quitting their jobs at a healthy pace, which helps lift pay gains. But they may need to do so more often to push wages higher. Nearly 3.2 million quit in September, near a post-recession peak reached in May. Still, the pace of quits has barely increased in the past 18 months.  Most workers quit to take new jobs, which typically pay more. Data collected by payroll processor ADP found that from July through September, full-time workers who switched jobs saw their earnings rise 4.9 percent from a year earlier. Those who stayed in their jobs saw a smaller gain of 4.3 percent.  The disparities between those who switched jobs and those who stayed were much higher in some industries. In leisure and hospitality, which includes restaurants and hotels as well as bars and casinos, those who quit and took new jobs saw annual gains of 6.9 percent. Those who stayed in their jobs saw just a 4.8 percent gain.  In a category that includes high-tech workers, switchers saw pay gains of 6.1 percent, compared with 5.1 percent for those who stayed in their jobs.",3.75,10,"[3.5, 3.5, 2.5, 4.5, 2.5, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 5.0]"

Mirroring October’s overall drop in unemployment, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the improved numbers offset a decline in September that largely reflected the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Harvey in Florida and Texas.  While the unemployment rate for veterans only dropped 0.3 percent between September and October, the rate was down from 4.3 percent in October 2016 and from almost 10 percent in 2010.  For veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan – referred to as post-9/11 veterans – the unemployment rate was 3.6 percent, compared to 4.7 percent in October 2016, and 10.2 percent in 2009.  The White House used the dropping unemployment rates -- overall jobless rate ticked down to a 17-year low of 4.1 percent in October – to tout President Trump’s plans to jump-start the economy.  ""Numbers are phenomenal over the last year — since November 8th, Election Day,” Trump told business leaders in Tokyo on Monday. “Our unemployment is at a 17-year low. We've gotten almost 2 million more people in the workforce in just that short period of time. I've reduced regulations terrifically, frankly, if I do say so myself.”  Observers, however, caution that the drop in unemployment is due in part to many Americans giving up searching for work — one of the criticisms Trump made of President Obama's record during the 2016 campaign. Many of the economic figures Trump cites are advancing a recovery from the Great Recession that dates back to the middle of 2009.  As for the stock market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average returned to its previous peak in March 2013 and has been setting records ever since.

According to Gizmodo, the groups include Raliance, National Network to End Domestic Violence, No More, Women of Color Network, Casa de Esperanza, A Call to Men, and The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs. The $5 million pledge will roll out over the next five years.  The company is also pledging money towards “an employee training program and in-app messaging to educate riders and drivers.”  The pledge comes after numerous rape and sexual assault allegations from passengers against Uber drivers.  Just this month, a San Antonio-based Uber driver was accused of “taking an unconscious female passenger to his home where he allegedly sexually assaulted her,” while in July, a driver was charged with the rape of a 16-year-old passenger in Australia.  In 2015, a British actress was also allegedly verbally abused by a “Sharia” Uber driver who claimed she was dressed “disgustingly.”  “We have spent months learning from experts and doing what we feel is an important first step: Listening,” claimed Uber in a blog post announcing the pledge. “From having honest conversations with experts who are on the front lines tirelessly raising awareness of sexual assault and domestic violence everyday, to asking ourselves some important questions. How can we best use our resources? How can we activate our vast global network of users – including riders and drivers – and employees to raise awareness and drive prevention? How can we be part of the solution?”  “As a result of this ongoing collaboration we have begun to make important changes internally and will commit to use Uber’s scope and visibility to help drive awareness, education and prevention of sexual assault and domestic violence to millions globally,” they continued, adding, “The $5 million commitment over five years will fund programmatic partnerships focused on prevention.”  “Uber’s technology enhances safety for riders and drivers in ways that weren’t possible before such as GPS tracking, the ability to share a trip with family and friends, and 24/7 support through the app,” the company declared. “We use technology to increase accountability and transparency such as providing riders with driver and car information before a trip and our two-way feedback system and features like Real-Time ID Check which help verify that the right driver is behind the wheel. Continuing to invest in this technology and develop new products that contribute to the safety of everyone who drives and rides using the app is a top priority.”  Concluding their blog post, Uber proclaimed, “We will continue to listen, learn, collaborate and build on our commitment to prevent sexual assault and domestic violence. Many other efforts have already been set in motion from global listening tours, to internal speaker series, to engaging employee volunteerism. We choose not to remain silent but to join other leading corporations and organizations pioneering efforts in this area.”  In September, Uber lost its license to operate in London, being publicly deemed as “not fit and proper” to function in the city, while this month it was reported that the company is subject to five criminal probes from the Justice Department.  Uber previously attacked Breitbart News, demanding its advertisements be removed from the website, and declaring that the ridesharing company wants “nothing to do” with Breitbart News and its readers.

1489,3157,11,7,2017,2017-11-07,Vox,How flawed science helped turn chocolate into a health food,"Have you heard? Dark chocolate will do everything from boost your cognition to reduce your cardiovascular disease risk and even help you lose weight! Or so the chocolate science hype machine will tell you.  Several months ago, we got to wondering how chocolate candy had earned such a powerful health halo. So we dove into the science behind these claims about chocolate and cocoa to find out more.  In an original Vox analysis, we discovered that food companies like Nestlé, Mars, Barry Callebaut, and Hershey’s — among the world’s biggest producers of chocolate — have poured millions of dollars into scientific studies and research grants that support cocoa science. Of the 100 Mars-sponsored studies on cocoa, chocolate, and health, 98 had conclusions that were favorable to the candy maker in some way.  That’s an uncannily high number. And it raises questions about the quality of the studies, given that Mars and other chocolate makers can use the positive findings to market their products. Industry-sponsored studies are more likely than independent research to yield conclusions that favor the funder’s products.  In our review of the research, we found studies that were well-designed, well-executed, and that produced seemingly reliable results. (This was particularly true for the science on cocoa’s effects on blood pressure.) But some of the other claims don’t stand up as well when you look closely at the evidence.  One study in particular about cocoa staving off cognitive decline jumped out at us because it had sparked a small fracas on PubMed Commons, a site where researchers can comment on published studies. Several researchers took the time to critique everything from the study’s design and statistical analysis to how it was reported in the journal where it was published, Nature Neuroscience.  This Mars-sponsored study, led by researchers from Columbia University, was published in 2014. The researchers had wanted to test whether taking cocoa supplements might enhance a region of the brain called the dentate gyrus that deteriorates with age and is associated with age-related memory loss. They concluded that cocoa supplements — particularly the micronutrients called flavanols in them — can indeed boost cognition in older adults.  The research didn’t come out of a vacuum. Previous studies, particularly those focused on aging in rats, suggested flavanols might prevent cognitive decline. But upon closer examination, it became clear that this particular study was very small and preliminary — and that there were several problems with its design that made its results unreliable. That didn’t stop the chocolate hype machine, though. The paper was trumpeted by the Columbia University press office and large media outlets as more evidence that cocoa and chocolate can fight Alzheimer’s.  Ultimately, the study shows how scientists and the media have seized upon the narrative that chocolate is a health food — even when only the thinnest evidence supports the wishful claim.  The cocoa study was short, small, and focused on narrow outcomes that don’t matter to the real world  Before we dive into what made this Nature Neuroscience study suspicious, let’s look at what it was about. The researchers randomly assigned 37 people to one of four groups for a period of three months:  A group that got a high daily dose (900 mg) of cocoa flavanol supplements as well as one hour of aerobic exercise four times per week A group that got the same high dose of cocoa flavanol supplements but without the exercise A control group that got a low dose of cocoa flavanols (10mg) with the one hour of aerobic exercise four times per week Another control group that got the low cocoa flavanol dose but without the exercise  So basically, the study participants either got a lot of cocoa flavanols or not, and added regular exercise to their lifestyles or not.  The researchers wanted to test whether cocoa flavanol supplements might stave off cognitive decline in the dentate gyrus region of the brain, which is associated with age-related memory loss. They also wanted to see if exercise had any effect on memory, since previous studies had suggested it might.  In the study, they found that exercise had no impact on brain function — but cocoa flavanols did. “Dietary cocoa flavanol consumption enhanced [dentate gyrus] function in the aging human hippocampal circuit,” they concluded. They also made extremely bold statements in the paper, even suggesting that the effects they saw in the high-flavanol group demonstrated that cocoa could reverse age-related memory decline by as many as three decades.  Columbia University’s newsroom touted the research as demonstrating that “dietary flavanols reverse age-related memory decline.” The research was then picked up by media outlets, including the New York Times, which trumpeted chocolate — not just cocoa dietary supplements — as a memory aid.  But here’s the thing: The study never actually proved that cocoa supplements, and especially not chocolate, could prevent memory decline. It was too small, too narrowly focused, and too short-lived to tell us anything important about real memory loss with aging, said Henry Drysdale, a doctor and fellow at Oxford University’s Center for Evidence-Based Medicine.  To track memory decline, the main outcomes the researchers used over a 12-week period were an fMRI test that looked at increases cerebral blood volume, as well as a cognitive function test — the Modified Benton — which was developed at Columbia to measure dentate gyrus function. The researchers who validated the test found that people’s performance on the ModBent worsened with age, so they had reason to believe that this test would be a good marker of whether flavanols could make a difference here.  “Saying if you eat cocoa supplements now you’re going to have better memory in three months is not relevant to real-world [age-related memory decline],” said Drysdale, who co-founded Oxford’s COMPare Trials project which examines the quality of clinical trials.  If you really want to answer that question, you’d run the trial for several years and you’d need a group of study participants that’s bigger than 37 people. Instead of only tracking the study participants’ brain waves in an MRI machine (which is not a measure of cognitive ability), or using an object recognition task (the ModBent) to test memory, you’d also want to measure outcomes that matter in people’s lives, like, whether those taking cocoa could remember what they did that morning or that they had a doctor’s appointment next week better than the people who didn’t take the cocoa, Drysdale added.  This trial only demonstrated that supplements seem to enhance brain function over a period of weeks, and only according to a very specific (and not very widely used) test of cognitive function. That is far from valid proof that cocoa is a memory enhancer.  The researchers did other things that made the results unreliable  Drysdale and other researchers who were not involved with this study also took issue with it for much nerdier reasons. There are problems with how the study was reported that made its results less likely to be reliable — and even less worthy of the hype.  For one thing, the published version of the study looks different from what the researchers originally said they’d set out to do for this trial.  To understand why this matters, let’s step back for a moment.  Before researchers embark on clinical trials, they're supposed to name (or “pre-specify”) which health outcomes they're most interested in on a public database, like ClinicalTrials.gov.  For an antidepressant, these might include people's reports on their mood, or how the drug affects sleep, sexual desire, and even suicidal thoughts. Researchers then group the outcomes into “primary” and “secondary” categories — the primary outcomes being the ones they think are most important — and describe precisely how and when they are going to measure these things.  Scientists are then supposed to broadly stick to this plan when they run their trial, and report on their findings in a journal. If they deviate from their plan, they need to be transparent about it and explain why they did so in the final journal article.  The idea is that researchers won't just change their plans along the way, or publish positive or more favorable outcomes that turn up during the study, while ignoring or hiding important results that don't quite materialize as they were hoping. (That’s a sneaky practice called “outcome switching,” and it’s a big problem in science.) Following these steps also enhances the chances that the findings researchers report on are real, not the result of tweaking a study’s design to get splashier conclusions.  But this didn’t happen in the case of this cocoa study.  ClinicalTrials.gov has a handy version control function that lets you see all the changes that were made to a clinical trials registry over time. It shows that the researchers for this cocoa study changed their outcomes over time, and also failed to clearly pre-specify them before starting the trial. They then didn’t report about the changes they made in their final study, which was published in the prestigious journal Nature Neuroscience.  For example, if you look at the earliest version of their ClinicalTrials.gov report, from 2010, the researchers stated that the primary outcome they were interested in was an fMRI test that measures cerebral blood volume. The secondary outcome they were going to look for was “neurocognitive function” — but they didn’t say which test they’d use to measure neurocognitive function. In the published trial, the ModBent appeared as a second primary outcome along with the fMRI.  “If you don't pre-specify your method of measurement of an outcome — in this case ‘neurocognitive function’ — you are free to choose, consciously or unconsciously, from a range of possible outcomes,” said Drysdale. “You can then pick the outcome that makes your chocolate look good. That’s not to say authors will always do this with vaguely pre-specified outcomes, but the option is there.” In this case, the researchers settled on the ModBent task as their primary outcome (in addition to the fMRI).  I asked the authors on the study why they failed to fully pre-specify their outcomes, and why they didn’t report all the changes they made in their original plan in the final version of the report, like they’re supposed to do. They said they were new to entering clinical trials data on registries, and that they didn’t realize they had to declare changes they had made to their study design in the final study. Whatever the reason, though, these errors in reporting are likely to make their findings less reliable, said Drysdale.  If you look at the most recent version of their clinical trials registry, it was published in January 2015, three months after they published their Nature Neuroscience article. “So they went back after article was published in Nature and changed their clinical trial registry. There is no mention of this in the trial report,” Drysdale added.  To be clear, this cocoa study is not unique. Hype in research is on the rise, and outcome switching is common — as prevalent in industry-sponsored research as it is in independent academic research. But the paper shows how, consciously or unconsciously, studies can be tweaked and exaggerated in ways that can yield misleading conclusions.  “The bigger concern is that people are trying to do a better job of selling the research itself and not just telling what the straight out answer is,” University of Toronto nutrition researcher Richard Bazinet said. This study only showed that over a period of three months, in a small group, according to a very narrow test that taps a very specific region of the brain, cocoa supplements enhanced cognition. That became “chocolate fights memory decline” — a message Mars surely appreciated.",4.071428571428571,7,"[4.5, 5.0, 4.0, 4.5, 4.0, 2.0, 4.5]"

Forged in 2015, the Paris agreement is a broad, voluntary framework designed to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels by the end of century.

Related 4 things to know about the Paris climate agreement  Before Syria, the only other holdout was Nicaragua, a country that didn’t sign because it thought the agreement didn’t go far enough. The Latin American nation joined the agreement in October.  Syria, meanwhile, has been enmeshed in a devastating civil war that’s killed more than 475,000 and displaced 14 million. Its government was also under sanctions, making it difficult for representatives to travel to international climate meetings. While it offered no explanation for its decision to join, it nonetheless sent to a pointed message to the US: You are all alone in your recalcitrance on climate change.  In June, President Donald Trump announced that the US would begin the process to withdraw from the agreement, claiming that it imposes “draconian financial and economic burdens ... on our country” and should be “renegotiated.” (The first claim is utterly false, and the agreement cannot be renegotiated, as Vox’s David Roberts has explained.)  In October, when asked about Nicaragua’s decision to sign, a White House spokesperson affirmed that the Trump administration intends to pull out. “As the president previously stated, the United States is withdrawing unless we can re-enter on terms the are more favorable for our country,” the statement said. (The White House on Tuesday said it had no additional statement on Syria and referred reporters to this one.)  It will take several years to formally withdraw.

South Korean police were on high alert in Seoul on Tuesday to monitor protests by both critics and supporters of President Donald Trump as the U.S. leader arrived in the country amid concerns over North Korea's nuclear threats. (AP Photo/Lee Jin-man)  SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Hundreds of South Koreans took to the streets of Seoul on Tuesday for two separate demonstrations, one to show support for visiting President Donald Trump and the other to voice disapproval of the U.S. leader amid concerns over North Korea’s nuclear threats.  Surrounded by thousands of police officers and a tight perimeter created by buses, hundreds of anti-Trump protesters rallied at a boulevard near the U.S. Embassy, holding banners that read “No Trump” and “No War.”  The demonstrators accused the outspoken president of raising tensions with North Korea and pressuring Seoul to buy more U.S. weapons. They also criticized him for pressing Seoul to re-do a bilateral free trade deal between the countries so that it’s more favorable to the United States.  Across the street, hundreds of Trump supporters waved the U.S. and South Korean flags and held signs that read “Blood Allies Korea + US.” They chanted “USA!” when Trump’s motorcade passed by the two protest groups for a meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in at the presidential Blue House.  More than 15,000 officers will be deployed to provide security during Trump’s two-day visit and monitor the demonstrations, according to the National Police Agency.  Anti-Trump protesters scuffled with South Korean police on Tuesday while trying to hold a rally against President Donald Trump's visit to Seoul. The demonstrators called for Trump to apologize for his rhetoric against North Korea. (Nov. 7)  Police had unsuccessfully attempted to block anti-Trump protesters from marching in streets near the presidential palace, with the Seoul Administrative Court ruling that such a ban would infringe on the protesters’ freedom of assembly. Dozens of anti-Trump protesters rallied near the presidential office earlier on Tuesday under the close watch of police.  “We oppose the visit to South Korea by Trump, who has heightened the fears of war on the Korean Peninsula,” said one of the protesters, reading from a statement.  The group, which calls itself the “No Trump Coalition,” also plans to protest on Wednesday near Seoul’s parliament, where Trump is to make a speech calling on the international community to maximize pressure on North Korea.  Pro- and anti-Trump protesters have been staging dueling but peaceful protests in Seoul in recent weeks ahead of Trump’s visit, reflecting a public deeply divided along ideological and generational lines.  Many South Koreans are concerned that Trump’s fiery rhetoric on North Korea, which has included threats of military options, is raising the risk of an unwanted war on the Korean Peninsula that could cost thousands of South Korean lives.  Others, including older people who tend to be more conservative, are supportive of Trump’s tough stance against the North, which has been accelerating its nuclear weapons and missile tests in recent months, and accuse liberal South Korean President Moon of being too soft on Pyongyang.  South Korea is known for its vibrant, and occasionally violent, protest culture that sometimes results in significant political changes. Massive but peaceful street protests by millions drove lawmakers to impeach then-President Park Geun-hye over a corruption scandal in December. Park was formally removed from office and arrested in March over charges including bribery and extortion.  The conservative Korea Freedom Federation released a statement welcoming Trump’s visit, which it described as a “God-like move” that would “instantly reverse” the security situation on the peninsula after the allies had been forced to the “defensive” by North Korea’s weapons tests. However, the group also lamented Trump’s decision not to visit the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between the Koreas during his visit to the South, saying that it might lead North Korea to misjudge that its provocations have hurt the allies’ morale.  Meanwhile, in the Philippines, dozens of protesters burned a portrait of Trump in downtown Manila on Tuesday, saying the president, who will join a summit of East Asian leaders next week in the country, is not welcome there.

1477,3138,11,7,2017,2017-11-07,Associated Press News,‘We still need to eat’: Tech boom creates working homeless," In the same affluent, suburban city where Google built its headquarters, Tes Saldana lives in a crowded but tidy camper she parks on the street.  She concedes it’s “not a very nice living situation,” but it also is not unusual. Until authorities told them to move, more than a dozen other RVs filled with people who can’t afford rent joined Saldana on a tree-lined street in Mountain View, parked between a Target and a luxury apartment complex.  Homeless advocates and city officials say it’s outrageous that in the shadow of a booming tech economy - where young millionaires dine on $15 wood-grilled avocado and think nothing of paying $1,000 for an iPhone X - thousands of families can’t afford a home. Many of the homeless work regular jobs, in some cases serving the very people whose sky-high net worth is the reason housing has become unaffordable for so many.  Across the street from Saldana’s camper, for example, two-bedroom units in the apartment complex start at $3,840, including concierge service. That’s more than she brings home, even in a good month.  Saldana and her three adult sons, who live with her, have looked for less rustic accommodations, but rents are $3,000 a month or more, and most of the available housing is distant. She said it makes more sense to stay in the camper near their jobs and try to save for a brighter future, even if a recent city crackdown chased them from their parking spot.  “We still need to eat,” said Saldana, 51. “I still want to bring my kids, once in a while, to a movie, to eat out.”  She cooks and serves food at two hotels in nearby Palo Alto, jobs that keep her going most days from 5 in the morning until 10 at night. Two of her sons, all in their 20s, work at a bakery and pay $700 toward the RV each month. They’re all very much aware of the economic disparity in Silicon Valley.  “How about for us people who are serving these tech people?” Saldana said. “We don’t get the same paycheck that they do.”  It’s all part of a growing crisis along the West Coast, where many cities and counties have seen a surge in the number of people living on the streets over the past two years. Counts taken earlier this year show 168,000 homeless people in California, Oregon and Washington - 20,000 more than were counted just two years ago.  The booming economy, fueled by the tech sector, and decades of under-building have led to an historic shortage of affordable housing. It has upended the stereotypical view of people out on the streets as unemployed: They are retail clerks, plumbers, janitors - even teachers - who go to work, sleep where they can and buy gym memberships for a place to shower.  The surge in homelessness has prompted at least 10 local governments along the West Coast to declare states of emergency, and cities from San Diego to Seattle are struggling to come up with immediate and long-range solutions.  San Francisco is well-known for homeless tent encampments. But the homeless problem has now spread throughout Silicon Valley, where the disparity between the rich and everyone else is glaring.  There is no firm estimate on the number of people who live in vehicles in Silicon Valley, but the problem is pervasive and apparent to anyone who sees RVs lining thoroughfares; not as visible are the cars tucked away at night in parking lots. Advocates for the homeless say it will only get worse unless more affordable housing is built.  The median rent in the San Jose metro area is $3,500 a month, yet the median wage is $12 an hour in food service and $19 an hour in health care support, an amount that won’t even cover housing costs. The minimum annual salary needed to live comfortably in San Jose is $87,000, according to a study by personal finance website GoBankingRates.  So dilapidated RVs line the eastern edge of Stanford University in Palo Alto, and officials in neighboring Mountain View have mapped out more than a dozen areas where campers tend to cluster, some of them about a mile from Google headquarters.  On a recent evening, Benito Hernandez returned to a crammed RV in Mountain View after laying flagstones for a home in Atherton, where Zillow pegs the median value of a house at $6.5 million. He rents the RV for $1,000 a month and lives there with his pregnant wife and children.  The family was evicted two years ago from an apartment where the rent kept going up, nearing $3,000 a month.  “After that, I lost everything,” said Hernandez, 33, who works as a landscaper and roofer.  He says his wife “is a little bit sad because she says, ‘You’re working very hard but don’t have credit to get an apartment.’ I tell her, ‘Just wait, maybe a half-year more, and I’ll get my credit back.’”  The plight of the Hernandez family points out one of the confounding problems of the homeless surge along the West Coast.  “This is not a crisis of unemployment that’s leading to poverty around here,” said Tom Myers, executive director of Community Services Agency, a nonprofit based in Mountain View. “People are working.”  Mountain View, a city of 80,000 which also is home to Mozilla and 23andMe, has committed more than $1 million over two years for homeless services, including money for an outreach case manager and a police officer to help people who live in vehicles. At last count, there were people living in more than 330 vehicles throughout the city.  Mayor Ken Rosenberg is proud of the city’s response to the crisis - focusing not on penalties but on providing services. Yet he’s also worried that the peace won’t last as RVs crowd into bike lanes and over-taxed streets.  Last week, Mountain View officials posted signs banning vehicles more than 6 feet high on some parts of the street where Saldana, Hernandez and others living in RVs were parked, saying they were creating a traffic hazard. The average RV is well over that height.  That follows similar moves over the summer by Palo Alto, which started cracking down on RVs and other vehicles that exceed the 72-hour limit on a busy stretch of El Camino Real.  In San Jose, officials recently approved an ordinance pushed by an interfaith group called the Winter Faith Collaborative to allow places of assembly - including gyms and churches - to shelter homeless people year-round.  Ellen Tara James-Penney, a 54-year-old lecturer at San Jose State University, parks her old Volvo at one of those safe haven churches, Grace Baptist Church, and eats in its dining hall. She is paid $28,000 a year to teach four English classes and is carrying $143,000 in student debt after earning two degrees.  She grades papers and prepares lessons in the Volvo. At night, she leans back the driver’s seat and prepares for sleep, one of two dogs, Hank, by her side. Her husband, Jim, who is too tall for the car, sleeps outside in a tent cot with their other dog, Buddy.  The Bay Area native remembers the time a class was studying John Steinbeck, when another student said that she was sick of hearing about the homeless.  “And I said, ‘Watch your mouth. You’re looking at one.’ Then you could have heard a pin drop,” she said. “It’s quite easy to judge when you have a house to live in or you have meds when you’re depressed and health care.”  In response to growing wealth inequities, unions, civil rights groups and community organizations formed Silicon Valley Rising about three years ago. They demand better pay and benefits for the low-income earners who make the region run.  SEIU United Service Workers West, for example, organized roughly 3,000 security guards who work for companies that contract with Facebook, Google and Caltrain, the mass transit system that connects Silicon Valley with San Francisco.  One of those workers is Albert Brown III, a 46-year-old security officer who recently signed a lease for half of a $3,400 two-bedroom unit in Half Moon Bay, about 13 miles from his job.  He can barely afford the rent on his $16-an-hour salary, even with overtime, but the car that doubled as his home needed a pricey repair and he found a landlord willing to overlook his lousy credit. Still, Brown worries he won’t be able to keep up with his payments.  His feet have been hurting. What if a doctor tells him to rest for a few days or a week?  “I can’t miss a minute. If I miss a minute or a shift? No way, man. A week? Forget it, it’s over. It’s all downhill from there,” he said.  “It’s a sad choice. I have to decide whether to be homeless or penniless, right?”  ___  Follow Janie Har at https://twitter.com/search?q=Janie%20Har&src=typd  Follow AP’s complete coverage of the homeless crisis here: https://apnews.com/tag/HomelessCrisis",4.115384615384615,13,"[4.5, 0.5, 3.0, 5.0, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 5.0, 5.0]"

In an echo of the Red Scare that consumed the nation for generations, business relationships once seen normal now appear tainted if they are connected at all to Russia.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)  MOSCOW (AP) — A shipping company partly owned by President Donald Trump’s commerce secretary is one of the few in the world that can transport liquefied petroleum gas in cold and icy conditions. Russia is known for its brutal winters as well as its giant, state-controlled oil and gas producers.  So, for years, Wilbur Ross’ company has been moving LPG for a Russian gas giant.  But now, in what might seem almost an echo of the Red Scare that lasted in America for generations, this business relationship is seen as tainted, an ominous connection to a country that unleashed cyberwar against American democracy and the 2016 election that put Trump in the White House.  Are all connections to Russia now suspect? Or are they sometimes merely an inconvenient consequence of doing business in a country where major corporations often are controlled by the Kremlin?  The latest tie between Russia, Trump and his campaign and administration officials came to light Sunday with news that the U.S. commerce secretary is a part owner of Navigator Holdings, a shipping company that transports LPG produced by Sibur, a big Russian company with ties to the Kremlin.  Some shipping business experts who follow the company are shrugging off the news.  “Russia has a lot of commodities that need to go somewhere else,” said Benjamin J. Nolan, a financial analyst who covers Navigator for Stifel, Nicolaus & Co. He added, “Odds are, they are going to have long term contracts with Western shipping companies.”  The Russian government is a powerful factor in almost every part of the country’s economy. Some of Russia’s biggest banks, such as Sberbank and VTB are state-controlled, with their management answering directly or indirectly to the Kremlin.  Then there is Gazprom, a big gas supplier to Europe, and Rosneft, the oil producer. Both are majority state owned.  The new Russian giant in the spotlight, Sibur, has its own special connections to the state, and President Vladimir Putin in particular. It is partially owned by a man said to be Putin’s son-in-law, and two of its biggest shareholders are oligarchs close to Putin. One of them is his old judo partner.  The details of Ross’ stake in Navigator were found among 13.4 million leaked records on offshore entities used by the rich and powerful and famous. They are the biggest leak on the shadowy offshore financial system since the Panama Papers last year, and could shed more light on the byzantine ways companies and individuals hide their wealth or lower their taxes.  Following news of the leak, Ross has said in interviews that his ties to Russia are being blown out proportion. He told Britain’s Sky network that his Navigator stake had been previously disclosed in financial documents filed with government ethics officials, and noted that Sibur is not under any U.S. sanction. For its part, Sibur has said that only a tiny percentage of shipping business goes to Navigator, less than 3 percent of “logistics expenses.” It said that it is surprised by the “politically driven interpretation” in some media reports of its “ordinary business operations.”  Trump himself also has faced scrutiny over his business ties to Russia. In prepared remarks to the Senate and House intelligence committees, Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, disclosed that the Trump Organization had been pursuing a business proposal in Russia during the presidential campaign. Cohen has said that the proposal for a Trump Tower Moscow never came to fruition and denied it had any impact on the campaign, saying it was “solely a real estate deal and nothing more.”  No evidence has yet emerged that the business deals are being examined by special counsel Robert Mueller. The former FBI director is investigating the Kremlin’s interference in the 2016 election and any possible coordination with Trump associates.  As for Ross, the most obvious link to Putin is Kirill Shamalov, who is married to a woman who is said to be Putin’s youngest daughter. Shamalov once owned more than 20 percent of Sibur, but has since cut that stake to 3.9 percent, according to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, the group that has been reviewing the new trove of documents.  Another Kremlin link is the Putin’s old judo partner, Gennady Timchenko, the second largest shareholder of Sibur.  Businessmen with Kremlin links are sometimes tapped to work on key projects with political symbolism, such as the bridge to Crimea or the Sochi Olympics. Timchenko’s construction company has a role building stadiums for next year’s soccer World Cup.  Timchenko was sanctioned by the U.S. after Russia annexed the Crimea. The U.S. also barred banks from providing long-term financing to a gas company belonging to Sibur’s largest shareholder, Leonid Mikhelson.  Ross has never met Sibur’s Shamalov, Timchenko and Mikhelson, according to a Commerce Department statement, and was not involved in his shipping company’s negotiations with Sibur.  Kremlin connections can boost the fortunes of U.S. companies, but they can also backfire. Russian partners sometimes come under suspicion abroad that they are acting out of political, not purely commercial, motives.  The state gas company Gazprom, in particular, has been accused of manipulating price talks over natural gas to put pressure on governments of other European countries, particularly Ukraine. That’s prompted many European countries to seek gas supplies from elsewhere.  A deal between Rosneft and Exxon Mobil also has run into trouble. The Treasury Department fined Exxon Mobil $2 million in July over what it called “reckless disregard” for U.S. sanctions by signing deals with Rosneft’s sanctioned head Igor Sechin in May 2014. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was the U.S. oil firm’s CEO at that time.  Exxon has maintained it did nothing wrong and sued the U.S. government in an effort to stop the fine.  As for Ross’ Navigator, some experts say it’s hardly surprising the company counts a Russian company among its customers.  “Russia is the biggest producer of oil, and that needs to be sold in a global market place,” said Jonathan Chappell, a financial analyst at Evercore. “Navigator is perfectly positioned.”  ----  Condon reported from New York.

1467,3114,11,7,2017,2017-11-07,Fox News,"Election Day: Trump factor looms large in Virginia, New Jersey governor's races","Democrats have worked feverishly all year to make nearly every local election a referendum on President Trump – and Tuesday's gubernatorial races are no exception.  The Trump factor looms large in the marquee Virginia gubernatorial race, where Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam and his allies have churned out mailers and ads tying Republican rival Ed Gillespie to the Trump White House at every turn.  The Trump-referendum strategy has not been particularly successful for Democrats in the House special elections so far this year. But this time, polls in New Jersey and Virginia’s gubernatorial races show the Democratic candidates in the lead.  In New Jersey, Democratic nominee Phil Murphy holds a substantial lead over Republican Kim Guadagno.  But the race in Virginia is considerably tighter. According to the latest Fox News Poll released Monday, Northam holds a 5-point edge over Gillespie, who says there is “no doubt” the polls are close.  In the final stretch, Gillespie questioned whether the Democrats' Trump-all-the-time strategy is a sound one.  FOX NEWS POLL: VIRGINIA GOVERNOR'S RACE REMAINS TIGHT  “They’ve known they’re in a close race for some time. They’ve been throwing the kitchen sink at us with awful and vile ads,” Gillespie said on Fox News’ “Daily Briefing” Monday.  The most controversial of those ads was run by a Democratic group, Latino Victory Fund. It showed minority children seemingly being chased by a driver in a pickup truck, decked out with a Confederate flag and a “Gillespie for governor” bumper sticker. The ad concluded with a scene of a Charlottesville-like rally, with a narrator asking: “Is this what Donald Trump and Ed Gillespie mean by the ‘American Dream?’”  The ad was removed after extensive backlash.  ELECTION DAY 2017: FULL COVERAGE  Other mailers boast that Northam is ""standing up to Trump and Gillespie's politics of fear and hate.""  It's a message the campaign stands by as polls open.  “Independent groups are denouncing Ed Gillespie because he has run the most divisive, fear-mongering campaign in modern history,” Northam campaign spokeswoman Ofirah Yheskel said in a statement to Fox News. “It is not shocking that communities of color are scared of what his Trump-like policy positions mean for them.”  Northam has campaigned with Democratic power players like former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Joe Biden and even had a fundraiser headlined by Hillary Clinton.  WHO ARE ED GILLESPIE AND RALPH NORTHAM?  Meanwhile, Gillespie has garnered Republican support, with a fundraiser hosted by former President George W. Bush. He was joined by Vice President Pence on the campaign trail—but not Trump. Trump, though, has repeatedly expressed his support for Gillespie on Twitter.  ""The state of Virginia economy, under Democrat rule, has been terrible. If you vote Ed Gillespie tomorrow, it will come roaring back!"" Trump tweeted Monday.  Despite Democrats' claims, Gillespie seems to be keeping a certain distance from Trump, while telling Fox News that he would work with “President Trump and Vice President Pence and the Cabinet.” He listed priorities for Virginia, like “building more ships” and “keeping Norfolk the largest base in the world.”  “In terms of working with the president and vice president, any governor of Virginia has to be able to work with the president of the United States,” Gillespie said Monday. “That’s always been our history given our proximity. I’ll be able to.”  In New Jersey, Lt. Gov. Guadagno is dealing not only with attempts to link her to Trump but to outgoing and controversial Gov. Chris Christie.  Murphy, a multimillionaire former Goldman Sachs executive and former U.S. ambassador to Germany, said the choice for New Jersey’s next governor couldn’t be clearer.  “On the one hand more of the same, another Chris Christie four years of failed politics, of failed politices for the middle class that was hollowed out and ravaged, where public education doesn’t get funded, infrastructure is ignored, we become more unfair by the day and we are caught in this awful us vs. them vortex,” Murphy said at a recent campaign event. “Or we can turn the page and change.”  Guadagno’s response? She reminds voters that Christie is no longer on the ballot.  Murphy, like Northam, also has welcomed big names on the campaign trail, with former Presidents Obama and Bill Clinton, and Biden, at campaign events.  There is much at stake in both gubernatorial elections, but whoever takes the governor’s mansion in New Jersey could have the added responsibility of appointing a senator—if Sen. Bob Mendendez, D-N.J., is convicted in his corruption trial and resigns.  Menendez maintains his innocence. But if he were to step down, the appointment decision would have serious implications for Trump's policy agenda in a closely divided Senate.  “With the Senate so evenly divided, the outcome of the New Jersey gubernatorial election, if Senator Menendez were to be convicted, could determine the Trump agenda and if it would move forward with greater ease in the Senate,"" said Brigid Harrison, a professor of political science and law at Montclair State University.  Another race to watch Tuesday is in Utah, with the election to fill the House seat previously held by Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz who resigned from his post in June.

Former classmates of the Texas church shooter, Devin Patrick Kelley, said he was an atheist and outcast who thought Christians were stupid, the Daily Mail reported.  “He was always talking about how people who believe in God we’re stupid and trying to preach his atheism,” former New Braunfels High School classmate Nina Rose Nava posted on Facebook. She said she was in “complete shock” after learning Kelley was the killer. “I legit just deleted him off my fb cause I couldn’t stand his post.”  Facebook user Christopher Leo Longoria responded, saying, “I removed him off FB for those same reasons! He was being super nagtive (sic) all the timd (sic),” the news outlet reported.  Another classmate, Patrick Boyce, told the Daily Mail, “He was the first atheist I met. He went Air Force after high school, got discharged but I don’t know why.” He said Kelley seemed depressed lately. “He had a kid or two, fairly normal,” he said. “I was just shocked. Shill haven’t quite processed how he could have done that.”  Responding to Nava’s Facebook post, Michael Goff stated, “He was weird but never that damn weird, always posting his atheist sh** like Nina wrote, but damn he always posted pics of him and his baby — crazy.”  Nava described her former classmate as an outcast but not a loner. “He was popular among other outcast. I haven’t spoke to him since high school,” she wrote.  Sill another outcast, whose identity the Daily Mail kept private, said “I grew up going to school with him… Always creeped me out and was different.”  She said that Kelley recently made a comment on one of her Facebook posts, “I said I just want to move back to Texas,” she explained. “He said something along the lines of ‘Texas isn’t any better.”  “It’s crazy to think I grew up with him,” she stated. “Same town.

1453,3100,11,7,2017,2017-11-07,Vox,Trump's next immigration target: people living legally in US after disaster struck their countries,"For nearly 20 years, since a 1998 hurricane, the US government has allowed tens of thousands of Honduran immigrants to stay and work in the US rather than forcing them to return to Honduras.  The Trump administration hasn’t ended that reprieve just yet. But it’s hinting, strongly, that it’s going to try.  On Monday, President Trump’s Department of Homeland Security announced that it was unable to come to a decision about whether to extend Temporary Protected Status (an immigration program that allows people from a certain country living in the US to remain and work here indefinitely while their home countries recover from disaster) for 57,000 Hondurans. DHS is terminating the protections for 2,500 Nicaraguans as of January 2019.  The Hondurans get six more months of protection (assuming they reregister with US Citizenship and Immigration Services) while the Trump administration makes up its mind. But a senior administration official warned Monday that “given the information available to” Acting Secretary Elaine Duke, “it is possible that the TPS designation for Honduras may be terminated with an appropriate delay at the end of the 6-month period.”  Indeed, the State Department recommended Friday that it push both Honduras and Nicaragua out of the program — along with El Salvador and Haiti.  The four countries together account for about 300,000 people living legally in the US — many of them for decades. The administration will make decisions about their fates over the next few months. And it’s expected to tell all of these people that they’re no longer welcome.  The Trump administration has already made it clear that it wants to send a message that TPS will not protect immigrants indefinitely, and that it wants beneficiaries to start thinking about leaving the United States.  But because so many have been in the US for so long — 63 percent of Hondurans have been in the US 20 years or more — the real likely outcome is that these TPS holders will stay in the US without legal authorization. By doing so, they’d join the 700,000 young unauthorized immigrants who are facing the expiration of their protections under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.  Over its first year in office, the Trump administration has made it clear that it wants to completely overhaul the basis on which the US grants legal status to immigrants. It envisions a “merit-based” immigration system in which individual immigrants are selected based on their high level of education and relevant professional skills — and the government has no obligation to let immigrants come to or stay in the US just because their homes and families are already here.  There are a lot of current US immigration policies that run afoul of the Trump administration’s ideas of merit, but TPS might be the biggest affront to their vision. Not only does it extend legal protections to people based almost entirely on what’s happened in their home countries, rather than what they can contribute as individuals, but it applies to people who were already living in the US when TPS was granted — instead of allowing the US to select immigrants in advance.  In context, the message the Trump administration is sending immigrants through sunsetting the TPS program is the same message it’s sending all other immigrants: Don’t get too comfortable.  For the past 27 years, Temporary Protected Status has been used as a form of humanitarian relief  The Temporary Protected Status program was created to mend a gap in President Ronald Reagan’s immigration policy.  When Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 into law, granting legal status to hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants, there was one group that was ineligible for protection: those who entered the country without authorization in 1982 or later. While the majority of people in this group were immediately subject to deportation, nationals of certain countries were granted “Extended Voluntary Departure” (EVD) status, an administrative reprieve that allowed the US attorney general to exclude certain foreign nationals from the list of those set to be deported immediately.  The EVD program was controversial: There was little criteria on what made a country eligible for it, and critics of the program charged that designations were based on politically motivated factors that failed to protect nationals of countries with volatile on-the-ground conditions. That belief was solidified when Reagan rejected the Salvadoran government’s request that EVD be extended to more than 400,000 Salvadoran refugees who had entered the US to escape a violent civil war, a decision Reagan justified by saying that Salvadorans were already unlikely to leave the country.  The TPS program, created through the Immigration Act of 1990, was supposed to resolve this issue by standardizing the process for shielding nationals of certain countries from deportation. Serving as a form of humanitarian relief, TPS is offered to nationals of countries struggling with the aftermath of war, natural disasters, or other humanitarian crises where conditions on the ground make it difficult for people to return to safely. Ten countries — El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Syria, and Yemen — are currently in the program, which is overseen by the Department of Homeland Security and is granted in six- to 18-month intervals that can be renewed as long as DHS deems a designation necessary.  To enter the program, nationals of a designated country must clear a number of conditions: They must maintain a relatively clean criminal record and pass a background check, they must pay a $495 processing fee when they first apply for the program and every time their status is renewed, and they must reside in the United States at the time of their country’s designation. This usually means that TPS beneficiaries are undocumented immigrants who were already in the US, those who overstayed a visa, or those who hold some other form of temporary immigration status.  TPS beneficiaries are granted authorization to work in the US (and in some cases the ability to travel internationally) and a reprieve from deportation. But outside of that, TPS doesn’t grant many other benefits; beneficiaries do not have legal permanent resident status, and while a small number of beneficiaries may be eligible for green cards through the sponsorship of a US citizen family member, the program is not intended to provide a path to citizenship. As Cecilia Menjívar, co-director of the Center for Migration Research at the at the University of Kansas, noted in a report on Central American TPS holders earlier this year, TPS beneficiaries are in a precarious position; while they are granted some of the benefits of residing in the US, their lack of full legal status prevents them from truly accessing everything.  TPS is the opposite of everything the Trump administration stands for on immigration — and it’s picking a fight over it  Unfortunately for the Hondurans and other TPS holders, the Trump administration no longer views humanitarian relief as a primary goal of the US immigration system.  It doesn’t help that most of the TPS holders are exactly the opposite of the immigrants that the Trump administration imagines a “merit-based” system would attract. The median household income for Hondurans with TPS, for example, was $40,000, and only 38 percent of them had high school diplomas, according to January estimates from the Center for Migration Studies.  In addition to their longtime status in the US, an estimated 53,000 US-born kids have at least one parent who benefits from Honduras’s TPS designation. The fact that these people have now largely settled here is one of the chief arguments for keeping TPS protections — indeed, that’s the logic that’s led the government to renew TPS for Honduras 10 times already.  But to the Trump administration, this is evidence that there’s something fundamentally wrong with the TPS program — because a program called “temporary” shouldn’t be leading people to settle permanently in the US. So the administration has made it abundantly clear that that’s going to change — and that it’s going to wind down TPS protections whenever possible.  It started with Haiti. In May, the administration announced that it would extend Haitian TPS protections for another six months — but no further.  “The Department of Homeland Security urges Haitian TPS recipients who do not have another immigration status,” per the DHS memo formally granting the extension, “to use the time before Jan. 22, 2018 to prepare for and arrange their departure from the United States — including proactively seeking travel documentation — or to apply for other immigration benefits for which they may be eligible.”  Haitians’ six-month TPS extension expires in January — giving the administration until November 23 to announce what will happen to the 50,000 Haitian TPS holders after that. But the shot across the bow in May raised concerns that Hondurans and Salvadorans, the other two groups that account for the overwhelming majority of TPS beneficiaries, might not even get the six-month wrap-up period, and that the government would strip 300,000 immigrants of protections over the first 10 weeks of 2018.  “The message,” then-Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said at a Miami press conference shortly after the Haiti announcement, “is: ‘TPS is temporary.’”  Other groups with TPS heard that message loud and clear — especially when the Trump administration announced in September that it was kicking about 1,000 Sudanese beneficiaries out of TPS as of November 2018. Immigrant rights organizations started mobilizing in support of TPS. The Congressional Black Caucus wrote a letter in support of TPS for Haiti; the Congressional Hispanic Caucus wrote letters in support of keeping TPS for Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador.  The government of Honduras lobbied the Trump administration over the summer to maintain TPS protections; the government of Haiti, which had already asked for a longer extension in May than it got, redoubled its efforts to keep TPS for its citizens from going away.  Even the Chamber of Commerce — which has been largely silent on immigration issues since the last failure of comprehensive immigration reform in Congress — wrote to the White House in support of TPS.  The mobilization seemed rapid, but it made sense. TPS beneficiaries have deep roots in the US. For the Trump administration, that’s a concern. For many other institutions in American society, from businesses to church groups, it’s an asset.  Revoking TPS visas doesn’t mean they’ll be deported, but they probably won’t leave on their own  The Trump administration doesn’t have the resources to deport 300,000 people the minute they lose their TPS protections. Arrests of immigrants are up, but deportations are down — and even the rise in arrests is dwarfed by the rise in the number of people the Trump administration considers deportable, compared to Obama-era policies.  Threats about an end to TPS are really an attempt to encourage “self-deportation” — to get TPS holders to stop expecting they’ll be allowed to stay in the US forever and start working on a plan to return home.  It’s a strategy that might make sense if TPS holders were determined to stay in the US as long as it was legal for them to do so but to leave the minute they lost legal protections. But neither of those appears to be the case.  When Hondurans first qualified for TPS in 1999, more than 100,000 of them were protected, according to an estimate from the Immigrant Legal Resource Center. That means that tens of thousands have left on their own (or adjusted to a more permanent legal status) even while they could have remained in TPS limbo indefinitely.  And as for the idea that the threat of losing TPS will inspire immigrants to leave, just look at Haitians — who’ve already been facing that prospect for months.  Some Haitians “prepared for and arranged” their travel — to Canada, where they’re seeking asylum. But others, clinging to the fact that the Trump administration hasn’t officially declared that TPS will end, are resistant to make plans to leave the country that many of them have lived in for most of their lives. “I have nothing to go back to,” Uber driver and would-be college student Jean Jubens Jeanty told the New York Times in July. “Why not keep me here?”  This isn’t optimism. It’s simply not having alternatives. “It’s very unsettling,” a Queens College senior told the Times, “to know that you’re here and you don’t know what tomorrow is going to bring, or what is going to happen in the next couple of months.”  Losing TPS wouldn’t create certainty — it would just open up a deeper anxiety, in which fear of being deportable is replaced with fear of actually getting deported.  By November 23, DHS will have to release its final decision on Haiti. In early March 2018, TPS for Salvadorans will run out unless it’s further extended, and thousands of DACA recipients per day will start losing protections. In May, the administration will have to come to a decision on Honduras.  All told, the Trump administration could ultimately be responsible for making over 900,000 more people vulnerable to deportation. It’s creating deportable immigrants much faster than it can actually deport them. And the gap between the possibility of deportation and its certainty creates lives full of fear.",4.0,4,"[4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 4.5]"
1500,3168,11,7,2017,2017-11-07,Breitbart,"Trump’s DHS Nominee Authored Pro-Mass Migration Report with Multinational Corporations, World Banks","President Trump’s nominee to lead the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) once authored a pro-mass migration report with a committee stacked with executives from multinational corporations and world banks under the direction of the World Economic Forum.  Kirstjen Nielsen, who will soon go before a Homeland Security congressional committee, chaired the “Global Agenda Council on Risk & Resilience” in 2016, as Breitbart News reported, alongside globalist executives who represent multinational corporations and banks that have a history of promoting mass immigration.  Nielsen’s committee’s report insisted that Europe had no choice but to accept a huge wave of unskilled migrants from poor, conflict-wracked countries at the peak of the migrant crisis, which is still taking place.  “The key policy issue confronting Europe is not whether to accept forced migrants but rather how to turn the associated challenges into opportunities,” the report stated.  “Reframing the discourse surrounding refugees from one of risk to one that recognizes the substantial social and economic contribution they can make to their host societies is increasingly important in light of the current largescale influx of migrants into Europe,” the report urged.  Deutsche Bank  On the committee was a representative for Deutsche Bank, which has led a campaign against populist-economic nationalist insurgencies across Europe. For instance, following Britain’s historic vote to leave the European Union (EU), Deutsche Bank executives claimed that any reductions to mass immigration to Britain would be detrimental to the British economy.  The Deutsche Bank executives wrote in a report:  “The familiar Brexit narrative is that a fall in migration should lead to higher wages as companies are forced to pay-up for domestic workers. The corollary to this is that the increase in net migration over the last two decades has suppressed earnings growth, at least for low skilled industries. “While attractive for its simplicity, this narrative ignores some important considerations. The first is the link between productivity and wages. Wages cannot be raised sustainably above productivity without higher inflation. Otherwise, the labour costs of businesses will rise at the expense of profits.”  But, while calling for continued mass low-skilled migration to Britain, Deutsche Bank executives have also admitted that a “big number” of jobs at the multinational bank would be cut and replaced by automation, as Breitbart News reported.  “In our banks, we have people behaving like robots doing mechanical things, tomorrow we’re going to have robots behaving like people,” Deutsche Bank CEO John Cryan said.  Despite Deutsche Bank’s pro-mass migration campaign, where they claimed migrants would better the German economy, a report by Breitbart London last year revealed how the majority of migrants are unemployable.  Microsoft Corporation  An executive for the Microsoft Corporation also served on Nielsen’s pro-mass migration committee to help author the World Economic Forum report.  Microsoft, more so than any other corporation or bank represented on Nielsen’s committee, has been heavily involved in promoting mass immigration and amnesty for illegal aliens in the United States, as it would continue to turn profits for the corporation while driving Americans’ wages down.  In Microsoft’s latest attempts to push open borders policies in the Trump administration, the corporation revealed that it currently employs at least 27 illegal aliens who are shielded from deportation by the Obama-created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.  When Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Trump administration would be ending DACA, Microsoft executives immediately joined with open borders organizations and the big business lobby to demand an amnesty for the nearly 800,000 illegal aliens shielded under DACA.  Earlier this year, Microsoft announced it would be laying off up to 3,000 American employees, but has continued importing foreign workers on the H-1B visa to take U.S. jobs, as Breitbart News reported.  Microsoft is also one of the top recruiters of some 330,000 foreign nationals who get to remain in the U.S. after graduating from college through the OPT program, taking coveted jobs from American graduates.  Despite layoffs, Microsoft has continued lobbying not just for more foreign guest workers to hire, which are often much cheaper than if the company were to hire Americans, but they have most recently begun lobbying for amnesty through the term “comprehensive immigration reform.”  As Breitbart News reported, in the first quarter of 2017 during Trump’s presidency, Microsoft lobbied more for immigration and the H-1B visas than any other tech company. In Microsoft’s five out of eight lobbying reports, it referred to “high-skilled immigration,” which is synonymous with the H-1B visa, as well as amnesty, which would drastically depreciate U.S. wages.  Microsoft is generally the biggest pusher for more H-1B foreign workers and amnesty for illegal aliens, lobbying for those issues in 340 lobbying reports since 2008, when former President Obama first took office.  Citigroup  Nielsen’s pro-mass migration committee included a representative for Citigroup, one of the largest multinational banks in the world. Not only does Citigroup have a record of pushing mass immigration to the U.S., but the world bank has openly opposed Trump’s pro-American immigration agenda.  In 2013, when a group of Republican and Democrat senators were pushing what is now known as the “Gang of Eight” amnesty for the 12 to 30 million illegal aliens in the U.S., Citigroup was funding the effort.  POLITICO reported a year after the Gang of Eight amnesty failed:  Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, billionaire Michael Bloomberg and Citigroup exec Carlos Gutierrez gave immigration reform firepower last year when they lent their money or names to the cause.  In December 2016, just after Trump’s historic victory, Citigroup spent $100,000 to help oppose the pro-American immigration agenda that bank executives feared would come to fruition under the new administration.  When Breitbart News asked Citigroup to explain its opposition to Trump’s immigration agenda, a spokesperson witht the bank declined to comment.  Following Trump’s inauguration, when the president instituted a refugee ban from a slew of terrorist-sanctioned nations in the Middle East, Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat wrote a letter to the banks employees opposing the executive order, despite the risk some foreign nationals who entered the U.S. as refugees have caused for American communities.  The letter reads:  “Since the weekend, we have been reviewing the executive order on immigration, as well as statements by administration officials, to assess its impact. As a U.S. company and the world’s most global financial institution, we are concerned about the message the executive order sends, as well as the impact immigration policies could have on our ability to serve our clients and contribute to growth. We have been advising colleagues who could be affected and will continue to support them and their families. “We are proud of Citi’s diversity and the fact that we hail from over 100 countries. We encourage the leaders of the United States to find the right balance between protecting the country and its longstanding role as an open and welcoming society.”",2.25,2,"[2.5, 2.0]"
1499,3167,11,7,2017,2017-11-07,Breitbart,Corey Stewart: Virginia Governor Election Could ‘Set the Stage for Knocking Out Tim Kaine in 2018’,"Corey Stewart, Republican Senate candidate from Virginia in the 2018 midterm election, looked at the Virginia governor’s race on Tuesday morning’s edition of Breitbart News Daily with SiriusXM hosts Alex Marlow, Raheem Kassam, and Steve Bannon.  “About ten days ago, Gillespie was way down in the polls. All these polls had him down by at least eight points, or down by ten,” Stewart noted.  “As Ed campaigned and became more Trumpian, he has more embraced the Trump agenda, it looks a lot like the campaign that I ran against him, frankly – running on issues such as protection of historical monuments, cracking down on MS-13 and other illegal alien criminals, and starting to embrace a little bit of the president but not completely,” he said, referring to his race against Gillespie for the Republican gubernatorial nomination.  “As he’s done that, his poll numbers have come way up. The RealClearPolitics average has him down by a little bit more than three points, which is a dramatic improvement, but he does seem to have some momentum on his side at this point,” Stewart said.  Bannon asked why the Trump agenda was so important to the Commonwealth.  “It’s important to remember that Virginia, we did lose it in 2016, but not by much,” Stewart replied. “At the end of the campaign, the campaign made the decision to really kind of focus the resources – and probably rightly so – on Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio. But Virginia could have been won.”  “And so the indication this year, this is really the only competitive election in 2017, was what happened in 2016 – was that an aberration, was it a one-time thing? Or was it the beginning of a big movement that’s bigger than Trump himself, bigger than the presidency?” he asked. “That’s really what is at stake today here in Virginia.”  Bannon asked why immigration was such a hot issue in Virginia.  “I don’t think people realize just how much illegal immigration affects the states that are not on the border,” Stewart replied. “Virginia has had a problem with illegal immigration for at least a couple of decades. Ten years ago, I led the biggest crackdown on illegal immigration in the country in Prince William County, which is in northern Virginia, a Democratic stronghold. I’ve been governing that county for ten years, and I’ve been getting re-elected largely based upon that issue because people are upset with illegal aliens coming in here and committing crimes.”  “This transcends political boundaries. This transcends racial lines,” he argued. “People believe that if somebody is in the country illegally, and they commit a crime, they should be deported. In Virginia, you’ve got this MS-13 gang. Eigthy percent of the members are illegal aliens, and they’ve been committing heinous crimes not just in northern Virginia, but in the other major area of Virginia, the Tidewater area where Virginia Beach is. Just recently, up and down the 81 corridor and in rural parts of the state, MS-13 has really been gaining ground and committing murders and other heinous crimes across the western part of Virginia as well.”  Stewart charged that Democrats cannot answer tough questions about MS-13 and illegal alien crime because “they know that people are upset about it, and they’ve got the left wing of their base that they’re trying to placate, the Bernie Sanders wing.”  “They’re trying to have this balancing act, trying to figure out a way to placate the far left and try to keep your more moderate Democrats in line. It’s not going to work,” he predicted. “The way we know that is, this left-wing group called the Latino Victory Fund ran this ad which is the biggest gift to Ed Gillespie and the Republicans of Virginia, and it was probably the dumbest move by liberals in the past year. They ran this ad where you’ve got this white guy in a pickup truck flying the Gadsden flag, flying the ‘Don’t Tread on Me’ flag, trying to run down minority children.”  “If Gillespie didn’t have momentum behind him at the beginning of that ad, he certainly has it now, even though he’s kind of a boring candidate, to be truthful,” Stewart said. “This ad has really ginned up not just opposition to the Democrats by Republicans, but from working-class people across the state.”  “It’s important just to get out there and vote,” he stressed. “At this point, you can just go to the State Board of Elections website to figure out where to vote, if people don’t know.”  “Let me just finish with this, and that is that what happens in Virginia in 2017 – if we win this state, or even if we come close today, it does set the stage for knocking out Tim Kaine in 2018 during my race for the Senate,” Stewart said. “It’s so important not just for who is governor of Virginia, but who is going to be the next U.S. senator from Virginia.”  “The problem that Tim Kaine’s got, his son is a member of Antifa,” he added. “His son was arrested in Minneapolis for disguising himself, putting on a hood and everything else, and then trying to flee arrest. Tim Kaine, instead of saying, ‘Well, my son made a mistake,’ he, instead, said, ‘Well, I’m proud that my son was involved in politics.’ His son was attacking law-abiding Trump supporters in Minneapolis!”  “You’ve got Kaine who wants to be seen as somewhat of a non-partisan figure, but when he ran for vice president, all that came unraveled, and people see him for the far-left politician that he is,” Stewart declared.  “Democrats have this civil war. You’ve got this book that’s being published today by Donna Brazile, and let me say that in Virginia, this division between the Bernie Sanders wing and the Hillary Clinton/Kaine wing of the party, the establishment part of the Democratic Party – it’s all coming unraveled. The Democratic Party, if it loses today, there are going to be even more recriminations and infighting among Democrats,” he predicted.

1502,3170,11,7,2017,2017-11-07,Fox News,"Democrats Northam, Murphy win gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey","Democrats rode to victory in Tuesday's hotly contested gubernatorial elections, as Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie in Virginia and Phil Murphy beat Republican Kim Guadagno in New Jersey.  The victories -- especially the win in Virginia -- are a shot in the arm to the beleaguered Democratic Party, which has lost four special congressional elections to Republicans since Donald Trump was elected president a year ago.  Northam, Virginia's lieutenant governor, won with the support of federal government employees and non-white voters, according to the Fox News Voter Analysis.  Northam garnered 54 percent to Gillespie's 45 percent, with 99 percent of precincts reported.  As he began his victory speech late Tuesday night in Fairfax, Northam was briefly ushered off stage by security after several pro-sanctuary cities protesters in the crowd began heckling him. Once he returned to the stage, Northam vowed to work to unite the state.  “We need to close the wounds that divide, and bring unity to Virginia,"" he said. ""Whether you voted for me or not, we are all Virginians. And I hope to earn your confidence and support as we move forward.""  Speaking in Richmond, Gillespie told supporters he had conceded to Northam.  “Obviously, wish it had gone the other way, but I thank those who voted,” Gillespie said.  Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez celebrated the wins by saying voters in Virginia and New Jersey “rejected a Trump-Pence agenda” -- though the voter analysis suggested President Trump was not a major factor at the ballot box.  Meanwhile, Trump reacted to the results by saying Gillespie, whom he supported, did not adequately embrace him during the race.  ""Ed Gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for,"" the president tweeted. ""Don’t forget, Republicans won 4 out of 4 House seats, and with the economy doing record numbers, we will continue to win, even bigger than before!""  Ahead of Tuesday’s elections, the president repeatedly tweeted his support for Gillespie in the race to replace Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe in Virginia. Polling in recent weeks had seemed to show Gillespie gaining ground on Northam in Virginia, the only southern state lost by Trump in 2016.  FULL ELECTION DAY COVERAGE  Towards the end of the campaign, Gillespie, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, emphasized issues embraced by Trump during the presidential campaign, vowing to crack down on sanctuary cities and the MS-13 gang.  The race between Gillespie and Northam had gotten particularly nasty in recent weeks, with each side accusing the other of running ads that were out of line and racially tinged.  VIRGINIA GUBERNATORIAL RACE GUIDE  Last week, a liberal group called the Latino Victory Fund released a television ad showing immigrant and minority children in Virginia being chased down the road by a man in a pickup truck with a Confederate flag and a Gillespie bumper sticker. Republicans decried the ad, accusing Democrats of fear-mongering. The group behind it eventually took the ad down after last week’s terrorist attack by truck in New York.  Meanwhile, Democrats repeatedly protested ads from Gillespie accusing Northam of voting for bills that would lead to a threat increase from the MS-13 gang. In a video posted on Twitter after he voted Tuesday, McAuliffe warned about a possible Republican upset and called on voters to reject the “bigoted, racist ads that Ed Gillespie has run against Ralph Northam”  “I do not want you waking up like you did after the presidential election last November and saying, ‘how could this possibly happen?’” McAuliffe said.  VIRGINIA, NEW JERSEY GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATES SPAR OVER SANCTUARY CITIES  Gillespie and Northam also sparred over the highly charged issue of removing Confederate monuments in the state. Northam's campaign attempted to tie Gillespie to the white supremacist violence this summer in Charlottesville, something Gillespie's campaign called an ""ugly character smear.""  Northam’s team portrayed the race as a referendum against Trump, labeling Gillespie “Trump's chief lobbyist” because of his former lobbying career.  The gubernatorial elections come as the national Democratic Party finds itself in disarray over former DNC interim chairman Donna Brazile’s new book claiming the DNC rigged the nomination for Hillary Clinton over rival Bernie Sanders in 2016.  In New Jersey, Murphy -- a former Goldman Sachs executive and U.S. ambassador to Germany -- will succeed outgoing Republican Gov. Chris Christie, who has seen his approval numbers take a drastic hit and is term-limited after eight years in office.  Christie's deep unpopularity made Lt. Gov. Guadagno's campaign an uphill climb from the start.  Like Gillespie, Guadagno spent the campaign railing against sanctuary cities, releasing an ad drawing attention to Murphy’s comments in support of New Jersey being a “sanctuary state” and telling the story of an illegal immigrant who was convicted of killing several students in 2007.  “Murphy doesn’t have our backs,” the ad’s narrator said. Referencing criminal illegal immigrants, the narrator added: “He has theirs.”  Like Northam in Virginia, Murphy responded by accusing Guadagno of channeling Trump.  “Kim Guadagno should be ashamed of herself for the way she’s politicizing the deaths of three children and painting a community with the broad brush of a murderer, a tactic she must have gleaned from President Trump,” Murphy said in response to the ad. “To say the least, these are not New Jersey’s values.”",3.75,2,"[3.5, 4.0]"

A rundown of the top races around the country on Tuesday:  TWO GOVERNORS  Voters in two states picked replacements for their term-limited governors — Democrat Terry McAuliffe in Virginia and Republican Chris Christie in New Jersey — in contests seen as an early referendum on the presidency of Donald Trump. In swing state Virginia, Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie. In New Jersey, front-running Democrat Phil Murphy overcame Republican Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno.  The stakes were high as both parties sought momentum ahead of next year’s midterm elections. Democrats haven’t won any special elections for Congress this year and the next Virginia governor will have a major say in the state’s next round of redistricting, when Congressional lines are drawn. Republicans were looking for a boost as their party is beset by intraparty turmoil between Trump and key Republicans in Congress.  Seattle voters will elect their first female mayor since 1926 on election day, with two female candidates vying for the office. One analyst says it signals a trend for women winning mayoral seats in Washington state. (Nov. 7)  BIG-CITY MAYORS  Democrat Bill de Blasio won a second term as mayor of heavily Democratic New York City. He easily defeated Republican state lawmaker Nicole Malliotakis and several third-party candidates.  In Boston, Mayor Marty Walsh won a second four-year term by beating City Councilor Tito Jackson after a low-key campaign.  Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan won a second four-year term by defeating state Sen. Coleman Young II, whose father was the city’s first black mayor. Duggan was first elected after a state-appointed manager filed for Detroit’s historic bankruptcy.  Two Atlanta city councilwomen, Keisha Lance Bottoms and Mary Norwood, were the top two vote-getters in the city’s mayoral race from a field of nearly a dozen candidates and are now headed to a Dec. 5 runoff. The winner will replace term-limited Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed.  In Seattle, former U.S. Attorney Jenny Durkan took a strong early lead in the race for mayor. Voters were choosing between Durkan and urban planner Cary Moon to replace former Mayor Ed Murray, who resigned earlier this year amid sexual abuse allegations. Ballot counting in the all mail-in election will continue over the next several days.  Charlotte, North Carolina, is getting its sixth mayor since 2009. Mayor Pro Tem Vi Lyles, a Democrat, beat Republican City Councilman Kenny Smith.  MEDICAID  Maine voters approved a measure allowing them to join 31 other states in expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. The referendum represented the first time since the signature health bill of former President Barack Obama took effect that the question of expansion was put before U.S. voters. Maine’s Republican governor had vetoed five attempts to expand the program.  UTAH’S CONGRESSIONAL SEAT  The Republican mayor of the Mormon stronghold of Provo, Utah, won a special election to replace U.S. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who resigned earlier this year. In an expected victory in the heavily Republican congressional district, John Curtis beat Democrat Kathryn Allen and third-party candidate Jim Bennett.

1526,3194,11,7,2017,2017-11-07,Associated Press News,"Kenya male lions seen in intimate act; bonding, experts say"," Recent photos taken in a Kenyan wildlife area show a rare sight: a male lion mounting another male lion in what resembles a sexual act but is possibly a way of showing dominance.  The spectacle of two wild male lions in such intimacy was also observed in Botswana last year and has sometimes been interpreted as homosexual behavior, though lion experts say it is a relatively uncommon form of bonding or social interaction.  Paul Goldstein, the photographer who captured the images in Kenya’s Maasai Mara reserve in August, said many other species are known to engage in such behavior and that, for example, he had seen giraffes doing it.  “It was just a dramatic thing to see,” Goldstein said of the male lions. He said he was astonished by a Kenyan media report in which Ezekiel Mutua, a Kenyan official, said the lion behavior was “not normal” and made remarks critical of homosexuality.  Wild male lions have only mounted each other for a day or two in past cases that were observed, and the activity happens “during periods of social stress or a realignment of their dominance relationship,” said Craig Packer, director of a lion research center at the University of Minnesota.  “There have been several observations of male lions mounting each other without intromission, and the males subsequently resumed their normal patterns of mating with receptive females,” Packer wrote in an email to The Associated Press.  “Male lions form stable coalitions and they are very affectionate with each other, but this affection is expressed by rubbing their heads together, licking each other’s faces and flopping on top of each other,” he wrote.  Another lion expert said cases of male lions mounting each other are “typically infrequent” and that he interprets it as a form of social bonding.  “Male lions have to commit to supporting each other when a territory is challenged, so maybe at times of territory take-over males are stressed and more likely to” engage in such an act, said Paul Funston, senior director of lion and cheetah programs at the Panthera conservation group.  In a blog post last year, Funston noted that a photographer documented similar behavior by two male lions that had traveled from Namibia to Botswana, and he described it as “remarkable but not unheard of behavior that was misunderstood by many.”  Ian Michler, maker of a documentary film called “Blood Lions,” said lions “have been known to ‘mate’ as a way of showing dominance of other males” in a group, particularly a new one.  While the lions photographed in Kenya and Botswana were confirmed to be male, Michler also remarked that some female lions with high testosterone levels grow manes, often don’t produce offspring and might be mistaken for males.  ___  Follow Christopher Torchia on Twitter at www.twitter.com/torchiachris",5.0,1,[5.0]

Air pollution in India's capital has hit hazardous levels prompting local officials to ask that school shut down and a half marathon scheduled later in November be called off. (AP Photo/Manish Swarup)  NEW DELHI (AP) — A thick gray haze enveloped India’s capital on Tuesday as air pollution hit hazardous levels, prompting local officials to ask that schools shut down and a half marathon scheduled for later in November be called off.  The readings of the government’s air quality index hovered between 350 and 450, indicating that the health impact of breathing the air was “severe.” The highest reading on the Central Pollution Control Board’s index is 500. The pollutants on Tuesday that had the maximum impact on the reading were PM 2.5 and PM 10 particulate matter.  As winter approaches, a thick, soupy smog routinely envelops most parts of northern India, caused by dust, the burning of crops, emissions from factories and the burning of coal and piles of garbage as the poor try to keep warm.  Over the past two years, New Delhi has earned the dubious distinction of being one of the world’s most polluted cities.  On Tuesday, Belgium’s King Philippe and Queen Mathilde, in India on a weeklong state visit, inspected a military guard of honor at the sprawling presidential palace in New Delhi under a cover of smog that hampered visibility.  As the haze settled over the city in the morning, many people covered their faces and noses with scarves to try to protect themselves. Arvind Kejriwal, the capital’s top elected official, asked the education department to consider closing down schools.  The Indian Medical Association said New Delhi was in the midst of a “public health emergency” and appealed to the city government to halt sports and other outdoor activities in schools. The association also said the Delhi Half Marathon, scheduled for Nov. 19, was likely to leave those participating especially badly hit because the air quality is worst during the early part of the day, when the run takes place.  The sharp drop in air quality is most dangerous for the elderly, children and those already suffering from respiratory ailments. Constant exposure to pollution also reduces lung functionality for healthy adults over a period of time.  According to a recent report by the Lancet medical journal on the impact of pollution across the world, one out of every four premature deaths in India in 2015, or some 2.5 million, was attributed to pollution.  Delhi has struggled with putting in place pollution control measures over the last two years. It has tightened vehicle and factory emission norms and reduced the number of cars on the roads on the worst-hit days. But it’s had a hard time enforcing laws about crop burning, garbage fires and construction dust.  Kejriwal said on Twitter on Tuesday that his government had written to ministers in the neighboring states of Punjab and Haryana demanding an end to crop burning there, but that little had been done.  “All of us together have to find a (solution) to this,” he tweeted, adding that the city becomes a “gas chamber for almost a month” every year.",4.5,1,[4.5]
1518,3186,11,7,2017,2017-11-07,Associated Press News,"Democrats sweep Virginia, New Jersey governor’s races"," Voters in Virginia and New Jersey gave Democratic gubernatorial candidates large victories Tuesday and sent a clear message of rebuke to Republican President Donald Trump.  In Virginia’s hard-fought contest, Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie. In New Jersey, front-running Democrat Phil Murphy trounced Republican Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno to succeed unpopular GOP Gov. Chris Christie.  The victors said Tuesday’s electoral results had far-reaching repercussions in a sharply divided country.  “Virginia has told us to end the divisiveness, that we do not condone hatred and bigotry,” Northam said.  “The days of division are over. We will move forward,” Murphy said in his own victory speech, invoking Trump by name as he looked headed to a double digit win. Murphy, who earned a fortune at Goldman Sachs before serving as Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, delivered his address in the same spot as Christie in his 2013 re-election— after Christie won big over his Democratic rival.  The wins in both states are a morale boost to Democrats who had so far been unable to channel anti-Trump energy into success at the ballot box in a major election this year.  In a contest viewed by many as a referendum on President Donald Trump, Democrat Ralph Northam accepted victory on Tuesday night in the Virginia governor's race. AP reporter Steve Peoples breaks down what it means nationally. (Nov. 7)  “The people are gonna rise up. They’re not gonna take what he says and this is not fake news,” said Leanna Barnes, a 76-year-old from East Orange, New Jersey, who voted for Murphy and called his victory a message to the president.  Virginia college student Tamia Mallory said she began paying attention to her state’s gubernatorial race when she saw tweets from Trump endorsing Gillespie. That motivated her to examine the race and find out who was running against Gillespie, she said.  “It was kind of an anti-Trump vote,” Mallory said.  Northam, the state’s lieutenant governor, repeatedly sought during long months of divisive campaigning to tie Gillespie to the president. His victory was in large part due to the surge in anti-Trump sentiment since the president took office. Democrats said they had record levels of enthusiasm heading into the race in Virginia, a swing-state and the only Southern state Trump lost last year.  Gillespie, meanwhile, sought to keep Trump at a distance throughout the campaign but tried to rally the president’s supporters with hard-edge attack ads focused on illegal immigration and preserving Confederate statues. The strategy was criticized by Democrats and some Republicans as race baiting, but drew praise from former Trump strategist Steve Bannon and others as a canny approach in a state that voted for Hillary Clinton last year.  Trump lent limited pre-election support to Gillespie with robocalls and tweets.  In one call, Trump said Gillespie shared his views on immigration and crime and would help “Make America Great Again.” Trump also said Northam would be a “total disaster” for Virginia.  But after Tuesday’s loss, Trump suggested that Gillespie hurt himself by not more closely aligning himself with the president.  “Ed Gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for,” Trump said in a tweet after Northam won. He also pointed out that Republicans have won every special election to the U.S. House since he was elected.  Northam’s victory is a blow to Republicans, who were hoping that Gillespie could provide a possible roadmap for moderate Republicans to follow in next year’s midterm elections. Several Republicans have announced plans to retire next year instead of seeking re-election, and Gillespie loss may prompt more such announcements.  A former White House aide to President George W. Bush and a Washington lobbyist, Gillespie struck a humble tone in his concession speech as he offered support to Northam. Gillespie wiped tears from his eyes while thanking his wife and said the million people who voted for him love Virginia, and so do those who disagree with them.  “And I know they too are rooting for our new governor to succeed because we all love the commonwealth of Virginia,” Gillespie said.  The mood was subdued at Gillespie’s gathering at a Richmond-area hotel, with supporters not shocked at the outcome but surprised at how poorly Republicans did. Democrats swept all three of Virginia’s statewide races and nearly wiped out Republicans’ overwhelming majority in the Virginia House of Delegates on Tuesday. A handful of races that will decide control of the body remaining too close to call.  Gillespie supporter Elsa Smith said Republicans needed to do a better job of appealing to minorities if they want to win future races.  “We are not taking care of the demographics the way we should,” said Smith, an owner of a Spanish translation business.  Democrats were gleeful at Northam’s victory party. U.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly called Northam the “perfect antidote” to the president.  “This is a comprehensive victory from the statehouse to the courthouse. Thank you, President Trump,” Connolly said.  The Democratic victories are another sign of Virginia’s shift toward a more liberal electorate. Democrats have won every statewide election since 2009 and now have won four out of the last five gubernatorial contests. Northam, pediatric neurologist and Army doctor, banked heavily during the campaign on his near-perfect political resume and tried to cast himself as the low-key doctor with a strong Southern drawl as the healer to Trump’s divisiveness.  ___  Catalini reported from Asbury Park, New Jersey.

Deborah Gonzales won House District 117 with 53 percent of the vote and Jonathan Wallace won House District 119 with 56 percent of the vote. Both seats are in the Athens area and both were vacant, hence the special elections. But not only were the two seats previously held by Republican incumbents, they were uncontested in the 2016 elections.  Superior Democratic recruiting in these kind of races is both a cause and a consequence of a national political environment that is now Democratic leaning. It’s much easier to get people excited about running for office when the climate is favorable, so the uptick in recruiting is itself a result of Donald Trump’s unpopularity. But it’s also the case that no matter how unpopular Trump is, you can’t win elections without fielding candidates. In 2016, Democrats didn’t have candidates in these races. In 2017 they did, and they both won.  The result in HD-117 should be particularly alarming for Republicans. Mitt Romney won it by a crushing 54-44 margin back in 2012. Donald Trump fared much worse than that, winning by just 49-46, but nonetheless winning. That’s a broadly similar pattern to what Jon Ossoff faced earlier this year in Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District. But while Ossoff failed to improve on Hillary Clinton’s narrow loss, Gonzales ran 7 points stronger than Clinton and flipped what had been an overwhelmingly Republican district as recently as five years ago.  In terms of practical consequences, the Georgia legislature remains overwhelmingly Republican, so losing two seats isn’t a big deal. But with Georgia as a whole being a state where Trump ran considerably weaker than Romney, Democrats are eager to take a big swing at the 2018 gubernatorial election and — if they can win it — have more influence on the post-2020 redistricting process and thus a better shot at the legislature. Special elections only tell you so much, but tonight’s wins bring Georgia Democrats that much more hope of winning a year from now.",4.75,2,"[5.0, 4.5]"

Trump is on a five country trip through Asia traveling to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)  BEIJING (AP) — After a brief truce with China to cooperate on North Korea, President Donald Trump arrived in Beijing on Wednesday amid mounting U.S. trade complaints, with limited prospects for progress on market access, technology policy and other sore points.  The strains between the world’s two biggest economies are fueling anxiety among global companies and advocates of free trade that they could retreat into protectionism, dragging down growth.  Washington accuses Beijing of backsliding on market-opening promises, and Trump said last week that the U.S. trade deficit with China — $347 billion last year — is “so bad that it’s embarrassing.”  “I don’t want to embarrass anybody four days before I land in China, but it’s horrible,” said Trump.  His government has raised import duties on Chinese aluminum foil, stainless steel and plywood, and is investigating whether Beijing improperly pressures foreign companies to hand over technology.  If they discuss trade during the two-day visit, Chinese President Xi Jinping’s government is unlikely to offer enough “to appease U.S. negotiators,” said John Davies of BMI Research.  That is likely to lead to “more protectionist measures on the part of the U.S.,” said Davies.  While Trump is looking to boost sagging public approval ratings, the Chinese leader enters their meeting on a political high.  The ruling Communist Party added Xi’s name to its constitution at a twice-a-decade congress last month, giving him status equal to Mao Zedong, founder of the communist government, and Deng Xiaoping, who launched economic reforms in 1979.  At the congress, Xi promised to open the economy wider but affirmed plans to build up state-owned companies that dominate industries including finance, energy and telecoms. That, along with plans for government-led development of electric cars and other technology, makes foreign companies worry that Beijing is squeezing them out of promising fields.  The chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, William Zarit, expressed concern that Trump appears to have done too little to prepare and said some companies worry his focus on trade in goods will mean he does too little about such “structural issues.” Zarit said those include limits on access to finance, health care and other industries.  In contrast to “advance work” for previous presidential trips to Beijing, “there really hasn’t been much of that for this visit, which makes us a bit concerned that there may not be much discussion on the structural issues,” said Zarit, a former American diplomat.  A senior administration official who briefed reporters in Washington denied that Trump hasn’t adequately prepared.  “We’ve analyzed this probably more than most administrations,” said the official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified further.  The official said Beijing has shifted to “moving away from market-based principles” and Washington wants movement toward a “market-oriented” system.  That echoes complaints by foreign companies that despite a 2013 pledge by the ruling party to give market forces a “decisive role,” restrictions on them in some industries are increasing. That led to a 1.2 percent fall in foreign investment in China in the first seven months of this year, breaking a series of annual double-digit gains.  Business groups have warned that Beijing’s efforts to shield its fledgling competitors in electric cars, clean power and other fields are fueling a backlash against globalization.  A possible U.S. response might be “closing down certain industry sectors that are now open to Chinese investment,” said Zarit. “I know we do not want to see any kind of a tit-for-tat, which could end up in a trade war.”  For its part, Beijing is pressing Washington and the European Union to grant “market economy” status to its state-dominated system. That would make it harder for trading partners to bring anti-dumping and other cases against China.  China says that when it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, it was promised that status would take effect last December. The United States, Europe and Japan reject that and say Beijing has yet to meet market-opening goals to qualify.  Chinese economists argue their country isn’t to blame for U.S. problems. They say global companies benefit from low-cost Chinese labor and a growing consumer market.  The loss of American factory jobs is due not to Chinese exports but to U.S. manufacturers moving to lower-wage countries, said Sun Lijian, an economist at Shanghai’s Fudan University.  “In the end, it is U.S. companies that have gained large profits,” said Sun.  Trump temporarily set aside trade complaints in April after meeting Xi for the first time in Florida and said he hoped Beijing would help discourage North Korea from pursuing nuclear weapons. They issued a “100-Day Plan” under which Beijing agreed to discuss expanding market access for electronic payments and financial services.  Despite renewed criticism on trade, “the U.S. needs continued Chinese cooperation” over North Korea, economist Rajiv Biswas of IHS Markit said in an email.  That means Trump will feel compelled to negotiate instead of using “blunt bilateral trade measures that could endanger the overall bilateral geopolitical relationship,” said Biswas.  Potential options for a possible new package of immediate measures include raising Chinese ownership limits in fields including securities, in which foreign firms can own only 49 percent of a venture, said Zarit.  “If you raised it to 51 percent, I think that would be progress,” he said.  China criticized Trump’s order in September to investigate whether Beijing violates its free-trade commitments by pressing foreign companies to hand over technology in return for market access. They complained that Trump was jeopardizing the global system by launching the probe under U.S. law instead of the World Trade Organization.  Few American companies have provided evidence for the investigation, possibly due to fear of Chinese retaliation.  The U.S. Commerce Department also is investigating whether Chinese exports including metal tubing, industrial resin and polyester fiber benefit from improper subsidies.  Trade is a smaller share of China’s economy than it was a decade ago and the U.S. market is losing importance for its exporters as sales to other developing markets grow. That blunts the potential impact of American tariffs or other sanctions, but the United States still accounts for about one-third of China’s trade surplus, and export industries employ millions of workers.  “The U.S. does have leverage to realistically threaten to damage China’s economic prospects,” said BMI Research’s Davies.",3.7,10,"[4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.0, 2.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5]"

First off, the party won convincing victories in the two marquee governors’ races. In Virginia, Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam quieted pundits by defeating GOP operative Ed Gillespie. And in New Jersey, financier Phil Murphy defeated Chris Christie’s Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno to retake the governor’s mansion for Democrats.  But the good news for the party didn’t end there. In Virginia, Democrats also won sweeping victories down ballot, particularly in the state’s House of Delegates — including in races that weren’t even on the radar of most electoral analysts. All sorts of Democrats picked up seats there, from conventional establishment types to a democratic socialist to someone who will be the first openly transgender state legislator in the United States. The Republican brand was simply toxic.  All of this is dreadful news for the GOP and President Donald Trump. Even in normal times, it’s difficult for an incumbent president’s party to defend seats in midterm elections. These are not normal times. Virginia’s results suggest Democratic voters have grown extraordinarily energized, particularly in the suburbs. And they suggest GOP control of the House of Representatives will be in real danger in 2018.  Winner: the Democratic Party  All year, it has seemed that Democrats were in disarray. The party’s shocking 2016 defeats had reduced it to a smoking ruin. Bitter wounds from that year’s presidential primary still hadn’t healed. The party fell short in several dramatic House special elections. Its leadership appeared out of touch with its voters. People knew they were against Donald Trump, true, but what were they for?  On Tuesday, though, the Democratic brand appeared to be doing just fine.  The “establishment” top-of-the-ticket nominees who were said not to be exciting base voters — like former Goldman Sachs executive Phil Murphy in New Jersey, and the much-maligned Ralph Northam in Virginia — won their respective races.  But their down-ballot candidates in competitive districts, and even some thought not to be competitive, did extremely well too. At press time, Democrats were within striking distance of retaking the Virginia House of Delegates — a truly stunning result that electoral analysts thought was unthinkable.  These victorious Democratic challengers were diverse — Hala Ayala and Elizabeth Guzman became Virginia’s first Latina state legislators, while Danica Roem will become the entire country’s first openly transgender state legislator. They also varied ideologically — Lee Carter, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, won an underdog victory. All of this goes to show that there’s not necessarily just one path to victory for the party.  Loser: Donald Trump and Republicans  Ed Gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for. Don’t forget, Republicans won 4 out of 4 House seats, and with the economy doing record numbers, we will continue to win, even bigger than before! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 8, 2017  It was always clear that 2018 would be an uphill battle for Republicans. The historical trend is unmistakable that once a president is elected, his party almost always has trouble winning off-year elections. Presidents with poor approval ratings, like Donald Trump’s, also tend to see their parties struggle.  Still, the scope of the Republican wipeout in Virginia should strike even more fear into the hearts of GOP incumbents. Control of the state’s House of Delegates was not even thought to be in play, but because of enthusiastic Democratic turnout — which it’s hard to believe wasn’t motivated by backlash against Donald Trump — it may well flip. (Several races hadn’t been called at press time and may head to recounts.)  The GOP came into the night with an enormous 66-34 majority in the statehouse. Many of their incumbents had been around for years and had grown complacent, never expecting a serious challenge.  The same is true in the US House of Representatives. Nearly two-thirds of Republican House members were first elected in 2010, and most have never even run for Congress in a world without Barack Obama in the White House. Now the world has changed. More Republican incumbents are seeing a tough challenge ahead, and many are announcing that they’ll retire to avoid it.  As for Trump himself, the Virginia debacle should be a major warning that he needs to change his political approach — or Democrats could very well retake the House, which would be a disaster for his presidency. Yet he has already become so toxically unpopular to so many voters that it could be too late.  Winner: Ralph Northam, Loser: pundits’ guts  The last 3 weeks of the VA governor's race has been all bad for Dems. https://t.co/7VpSw1nbW7 — Chris Cillizza (@CillizzaCNN) November 7, 2017  No Democratic candidate was second-guessed in recent weeks more than Ralph Northam. His campaign was called uninspiring. He was deemed to have no charisma. Liberals excoriated him for hedging in response to Ed Gillespie’s anti-immigrant attacks. Pundits assumed that, like Hillary Clinton, he was about to blow it.  But Northam didn’t just win — he romped. At press time, he led Gillespie by more than 8 points, and some analysts estimated his lead would likely grow further as more votes were counted. It was already clear, though, that he’d outperformed Clinton’s 5-point win in Virginia in 2016 and what polling averages were showing for this race. Turns out the Army doctor wasn’t such a weak and incompetent candidate after all.  Loser: Ed Gillespie’s demagogic campaign  Ed Gillespie was a longtime Republican and lobbyist who hoped to begin a political career in his own right. In 2014, he ran an under-the-radar campaign for US Senate in Virginia, and came shockingly close to upsetting incumbent Mark Warner (he was less than a point away from winning). So in 2016, he started putting things into motion for a run for governor the following year, and the GOP establishment enthusiastically backed him.  Then he found himself in a world where Donald Trump was the president of the United States.  What’s more, the party coalitions were changing — working-class white voters were increasingly drawn to the party by Trump, while educated suburban voters who demographically resembled Ed Gillespie were deserting the party.  So Gillespie made a bet. He thought that he could mobilize Trump voters through an ad campaign emphasizing hot-button culture war issues, but also keep the educated suburbanites on his side with his establishment credentials and an economic pitch.  To many political analysts, it seemed like a promising strategy. But it proved enormously controversial, as Gillespie was heavily criticized for ads stoking fears of criminal immigrant gangs and “sanctuary cities” (which Virginia doesn’t even have).  And in the end, it appears to have backfired spectacularly. Educated suburban voters abandoned Gillespie in droves and overwhelmingly backed Democrats. It’s not clear how much of that was due to a general anti-Trump backlash or Northam’s strength, and how much was due to disgust with Gillespie’s demagogic tactics.  But if Gillespie won, his victory would have sent a message that the Trumpist playbook was the most effective path to Republican victory across the nation. His defeat makes clear that’s not necessarily the case.  Winner: lower-income people in Maine (and maybe Virginia) who soon could be eligible for Medicaid  Obamacare appeared to be on the ropes at the beginning of the year, and most of the Republican bills to repeal it wiped out its expansion of Medicaid. But the GOP efforts to repeal the program derailed, meaning it’s still possible for more states to opt in to the expansion (which the Supreme Court made optional).  Up in Maine, the state legislature has been trying to opt in to the expansion for some time — but five separate efforts to do so have been vetoed by the state’s conservative governor, Paul LePage.  Finally, proponents of the idea decided to go over LePage’s head and take the question directly to voters. On Tuesday, they won overwhelmingly.  That’s not the end of the story — as Sarah Kliff writes, there are ways LePage could still throw a wrench into the process. But the vote is an unmistakable win for Medicaid expansion and indeed Obamacare itself. If implemented, estimates indicate this will result in 80,000 more Maine residents getting health insurance — and other states may look to copy Maine’s playbook.",4.166666666666667,6,"[4.5, 4.0, 5.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0]"
1516,3184,11,7,2017,2017-11-07,The New York Times,"Wind and Solar Power Advance, but Carbon Refuses to Retreat","For instance, the Diablo Canyon reactor that California plans to close produces 14 times as much power as the Topaz solar farm, which requires 500 times as much land, according to Environmental Progress. The Wind Catcher farm in Oklahoma occupies 2,400 times as much land as Diablo Canyon but produces half as much energy.  The most worrisome aspect about the all-out push for a future powered by renewables has to do with cost: The price of turbines and solar panels may be falling, but the cost of integrating these intermittent sources of energy — on when the wind blows and the sun shines; off when they don’t — is not. This alone will sharply curtail the climate benefits of renewable power.  Integrating renewable sources requires vast investments in electricity transmission — to move power from intermittently windy and sunny places to places where power is consumed. It requires maintaining a backstop of idle plants that burn fossil fuel, for the times when there is no wind or sun to be had. It requires investing in power-storage systems at a large scale.  These costs will ultimately be reflected in power prices. One concern is that by raising the retail cost of electricity they will discourage electrification, encouraging consumers to rely on alternative energy sources like gas — and pushing CO 2 emissions up.  Another concern is that they will drive wholesale energy prices down too far. Because they produce the most energy when the sun is up and the wind is blowing, renewable generators can flood the grid at critical times of the day, slashing the price of power. This not only threatens the solvency of nuclear reactors, which cannot shut down on a dime and must therefore pay for the grid to accept their power, but also reduces the return on additional investment in renewables.  A study by Lion Hirth of the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin found that the value of wind power falls from 110 percent of the average power price to 50 to 80 percent as the penetration of wind rises from zero to 30 percent of total consumption. “Competitive large-scale renewables deployment will be more difficult to accomplish than many anticipate,” he concluded.  The diplomats in Bonn may be tempted to wave away these concerns. Thomas Bruckner of the University of Leipzig argues that in the case of Germany, expanding renewables to supply 80 percent of power by 2050 is “not a significant burden.” Heavy German investment in renewable energy technologies over the last decade succeeded in bringing prices down, he contends; it will be much cheaper to go the rest of the way.",2.8333333333333335,6,"[4.0, 1.0, 5.0, 0.5, 3.0, 3.5]"
1513,3181,11,7,2017,2017-11-07,Vox,Ed Gillespie’s loss shows Donald Trump has made Trumpism toxic,"Ed Gillespie was the quintessential establishment Republican: senior adviser to President George W. Bush, chair of the Republican National Committee, founder of a bipartisan lobbying firm. He was also the GOP’s nominee for governor in Virginia, and he was losing.  Then he embraced Trumpism. He began running bizarre, fearmongering ads about Hispanic gangs and sanctuary cities. The polls narrowed, Democrats panicked, Trumpists began celebrating. Two days ago, Steve Bannon, Donald Trump’s former chief strategist, told the New York Times that Gillespie had “closed an enthusiasm gap by rallying around the Trump agenda … in Gillespie’s case, Trumpism without Trump can show the way forward.”  This was the Democrats’ worst nightmare: that Trumpism might work better without Trump. That Gillespie could take Trump’s culture-war playbook — his attacks on immigrants and diversity and disorder — and, in severing it from Trump’s erratic personal behavior, do what Trump couldn’t: win blueish states like Virginia.  Except Gillespie lost. He lost by more than Trump did. He lost by more than other Republicans running in Virginia. Trumpism without Trump didn’t just fail to win. It collapsed.  The reason, I suspect, is that Bannon had it exactly backward. The age of Trumpism without Trump isn’t ahead of us. It’s behind us, at least for now. Trumpism without Trump was possible before Trump was president. It might be possible after he’s president. It’s not possible while he’s president.  In 2016, Trump had the advantage of being a true outsider: He had no record to answer for, no unemployment rate to explain, no votes to justify. For all his oddities and eccentricities, he was a blank slate — a businessman to those who wanted a businessman, a culture warrior to those who wanted a culture warrior, a pragmatist to those who wanted a pragmatist, a conservative to those who wanted a conservative, and so on. He was theory severed from practice; “ism” without the reality check of is.  But now we have Trumpism with Trump, and the American people don’t much like it. Trump is no longer an abstraction, Trumpism no longer an idea. Instead, we are watching the real thing: a White House in chaos, a legislative agenda in shambles, a world in which nuclear war is likelier and America’s global leadership is diminished. Trump isn’t merely unpopular; he is less popular than any president at this point in their term since the advent of modern polling, and he is that unpopular even though the economy is growing and Americans are not dying in large numbers overseas.  The result is that a wave election appears to be building. As Vox’s Matt Yglesias notes, across the special elections held over the past year, Democratic candidates have outperformed Hillary Clinton’s 2016 margin by 11 points and Barack Obama’s 2012 margin by 9 points. If you average recent polls, Democrats hold a 9-point advantage on the generic congressional ballot. Tonight, in Virginia, Republicans saw what that means.  It is still possible that the theory was correct, that Trumpism without Trump might have been a winning formula. For now, however, that will remain untested. Trump is the president of the United States, and so there is no such thing as Trumpism without Trump, there is only Trumpism with Trump, and the dysfunction and disappointment and backlash it creates.",5.0,1,[5.0]

He was 88. (NASA via AP)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Apollo 12 astronaut Richard “Dick” F. Gordon Jr., one of a dozen men who flew around the moon but didn’t land there, has died, NASA said. He was 88.  Gordon was a test pilot when he was chosen for NASA’s third group of astronauts in 1963. He flew on Gemini 11 in 1966, walking in space twice. In 1969, Gordon circled the moon in the Apollo 12 command module Yankee Clipper while crewmates Alan Bean and Charles Conrad landed and walked on the lunar surface.  Over the two flights, he spent nearly 316 hours in space.  “Dick will be fondly remembered as one of our nation’s boldest flyers, a man who added to our own nation’s capabilities by challenging his own. He will be missed,” acting NASA administrator Robert Lightfoot said in a statement Tuesday.  Gordon died Monday at his home in San Marcos, California, according to the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation.  Born in Seattle, a Navy captain and a chemist, Gordon was such a steely professional that after a difficult first spacewalk, he fell asleep during a break in his second spacewalk. He downplayed Apollo 12 being hit by lightning during liftoff; backup batteries saved the crew from having to abort the mission.  “He’s a cool guy,” Bean recalled Tuesday. “He’s the kind of guy you want when you go to the moon.”  In a 1997 NASA oral history, Gordon said people would often ask if he felt alone while his two partners walked on the moon. “I said, ‘Hell no, if you knew those guys, you’d be happy to be alone’.”  Gordon called that experience wonderful: “You don’t have to communicate. You don’t have to worry about pleasing anyone beside yourself. And there’s a lot of things that you have to do and accomplish. And it’s a moment of solitude.”  Gordon and Bean described the second moon landing as a mission full of antics and dust.  When Conrad and Bean left the moon and docked their lunar module, Gordon said he looked in and “all I could see was a black cloud in there. I didn’t see them at all. I looked in there and said, ‘Holy smoke. You’re not getting in here and dirtying up my nice clean Command Module.’ So they passed the rocks over, took off their suits and underwear, and I said, ‘OK, you can come in now’.”  Gordon had been slated to command the Apollo 18 mission that would land on the moon, but it was cut for budget reasons. Apollo 17 was the last mission to the moon. In all, 24 Americans flew to the moon and 12 landed on it.  While in the Navy as a test pilot, Gordon won the Bendix Trophy Race from Los Angeles to New York in 1961, setting a speed record of 869.74 miles per hour.  Gordon was the instant leader of a star-studded class of 14 astronauts that included Apollo 11′s Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins and the last man on the moon, Eugene Cernan, Bean recalled.  “He was a happy guy and just the best possible crewmate and friend,” he said.  During his first Gemini 11 spacewalk, Gordon said he and crewmate Conrad “were so jacked up” that they were ready an hour early. When it came time to put on his helmet, it wouldn’t fit. After much effort and lost time, he got it on, but was exhausted and behind schedule.  “I was perspiring,” he later recalled. “My eyes were stinging ... they decided to quit.”  His second spacewalk was so calm that he and Conrad caught themselves falling asleep.  “It was nice and warm and cuddly,” Gordon said.  After retiring from NASA in 1972, he became executive vice president of the New Orleans Saints football team. He went on to be an executive in energy and science companies.  Gordon is survived by six children, two stepchildren and five grandchildren.",4.75,2,"[5.0, 4.5]"

They are putting your regime in grave danger.""(Kim Hong-Ji/Pool Photo via AP)  SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — President Donald Trump delivered a sharp warning to North Korea Wednesday, telling the rogue nation: “Do not underestimate us. And do not try us.”  In a speech delivered hours after he aborted a visit to the heavily fortified Korean demilitarized zone due to bad weather, Trump said he had a message for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.  “The weapons you are acquiring are not making you safer, they are putting your regime in grave danger,” Trump told an audience of South Korean lawmakers, calling on all nations to join forces “to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea.”  “The world cannot tolerate the menace of a rogue regime that threatens with nuclear devastation,” he said.  Trump had hoped to underscore his message with an early morning visit to the DMZ, but his plans were thwarted by heavy fog that prevented his helicopter from landing at the heavily fortified border that has separated the North and South for the last 64 years.  The Marine One helicopter left Seoul at daybreak and flew most of the way to the DMZ, but was forced to turn back just five minutes out due to poor weather conditions. Reporters traveling in a separate helicopter as part of the president’s envoy saw fog through the windows, and weather reports from near the heavily fortified border showed misting conditions and visibility below one mile. Pilots, officials said, could not see the other helicopters in the air.  US President Donald Trump delivered a blunt warning to North Korea: ""Do not underestimate us. And do not try us."" Trump sent the message during a speech to South Korea's National Assembly in Seoul. (Nov. 8)  White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president was disappointed he couldn’t make the trip. “I think he’s pretty frustrated,” she told reporters. “It was obviously something he wanted to do.”  Before he left for Asia, a White House official had ruled out a DMZ visit for Trump, claiming the president didn’t have time on his schedule and that DMZ visits have become a little cliché.  But Sanders said the visit had been planned well before Trump’s departure for Asia. The trip was kept secret for security reasons, she said.  The aborted visit came hours before Trump addressed the South Korean National Assembly as he closed out his two-day visit to the nation and headed to his next stop, Beijing.  In the speech, Trump painted a bleak portrait of life in North Korea, describing citizens as bribing government officials to leave the country just so they can work as slaves. He contrasted the poverty and desperation to thriving South Korea — home to a long list of top-rated golfers, he noted.  Trump said the U.S. will not allow its cities to be threatened with destruction, and said that, while America “does not seek conflict or confrontation,” it will not run from it, either.  “The regime has interpreted America’s past restraint as weakness. This would be a fatal miscalculation?,” Trump said. “This is a very different administration than the United States has had in the past.”  He also called on all nations to downgrade diplomatic and economic ties with the North and fully implement a series of U.N. Security Council measures, specifically calling out Russia and China, whose leaders he will meet in coming days.  On Tuesday, Trump’s first day on the Korean Peninsula, he had signaled a willingness to negotiate as he urged North Korea to “come to the table” and “make a deal” over its nuclear weapons program.  He also said he’d seen “a lot of progress” in dealing with Pyongyang, though he stopped short of saying whether he wanted direct talks.  “It makes sense for North Korea to come to the table and make a deal that is good for the people of North Korea and for the world,” Trump said at a news conference with South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in.  He also sounded an optimistic note on disagreements with the North, saying confidently, if vaguely: “Ultimately, it’ll all work out.”  It was a striking shift in tone for a president who for months had issued increasingly dire threats to answer any hostile North Korean action with “fire and fury.” In a recent speech at the United Nations, Trump said he would “totally destroy” the nation, if necessary, and has derided Kim as “little Rocket Man.”  North Korea has fired more than a dozen missiles this year but none in nearly two months. Analysts caution against reading too much into the pause.  Ever the showman, Trump had teased that he had a surprise in store, saying at a Tuesday evening banquet that he had an “exciting day” planned Wednesday — “for many reasons that people will find out.” He did not elaborate on what turned out to be the aborted trip to the DMZ.  Visiting the border that has become something of a ritual for U.S. presidents trying to demonstrate their resolve against North Korea’s ever-escalating aggression. Every American president since Ronald Reagan, save for George H.W. Bush, has made the trip, peering across the barren north through binoculars, hearing broadcast propaganda and reaffirming their commitment to standing with the South.  Visiting the wooded, craggy terrain inside the DMZ is like going back in time to 1953. In July of that year, the Korean War armistice agreement was signed at Panmunjom, the so-called “truce village” bisected by a marker that is the official dividing line between the North and South.  There’s no public sign of any diplomatic progress between Washington and Pyongyang. U.S. officials say the back channel between the State Department and the North Korean mission at the United Nations in New York remains intact, but contacts have not been substantive other than achieving the release of American college student Otto Warmbier in June. He died days after his repatriation to the U.S.  Moon, who has been eager to solidify a friendship with Trump, said he hoped the president’s visit would be a turning point in the standoff with North Korea.  ___  Associated Press writers Zeke Miller and Matthew Pennington in Washington contributed to this report.  ___  Follow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire and Colvin at http://twitter.com/@colvinj",4.75,2,"[5.0, 4.5]"
1461,3108,11,6,2017,2017-11-06,Breitbart,"Pakistan Establishes Agency to Monitor, Block Blasphemous Content Online","Islamabad has doubled down on enforcing Pakistan’s strict and controversial anti-Islamic blasphemy law, forming a regulatory body to monitor and block blasphemous content in cyberspace.  “Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), the government-run communications regulatory agency, has created a 25-member group tasked with cracking down on websites, social media accounts and online pages that they consider offensive to Islam,” reports Voice of America (VOA).  “The committee, being constituted by the Ministry of Interior, will include representatives from PTA, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), and the ministry,” revealed Ismail Shah, the PTA’s chairman, when speaking to a Pakistan parliament panel.  In May, PTA officials reportedly warned millions of Pakistan resident via text message not to post or share blasphemous content online, which involves anything seen as an explicit insult to Allah, Islam, or religious leaders.  Social media companies such are Facebook and Twitter are allegedly doing little to stop Pakistan’s efforts to crackdown on anti-Islamic content online.  Pakistani government officials have reportedly accused Facebook of assisting Islamabad in taking down such content.  The Muslim-majority country’s blasphemy law is primarily used to target religious minorities, namely Christians, according to several analysts, including the British Pakistani Christian Association (BPCA), which tracks cases of Christian persecution in Pakistan.  Blasphemy criminal cases seldom result in a fair trial, often leading to the harsh verdict of life in prison or death mandated by the statue.  The first blasphemy-linked death sentence affiliated with social media surfaced earlier this year.  A Pakistani court found Taimoor Raza, 30, guilty of insulting the prophet Muhammad.  “Raza was arrested last year after a debate about Islam on Facebook with a man who turned out to be a counter-terrorism agent,” reported the Guardian. “He was one among 15 people arrested by the counter-terrorism department last year, accused of blasphemy, according to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan.”  Although the Pakistani government has not yet carried out a blasphemy-related death sentence, Islamic extremists in the country have taken their version of justice into their hands  Mukhtar Masih, a 70-year-old Pakistani Christian arrested on charges of blasphemy earlier this year, recently died before he could face trial.  Christians as young as eight years old have been accused of insulting Islam in one way or another in Pakistan, where an estimated 100 people are reportedly detained on such charges each year.  The law appears to be popular among the predominantly Muslim population. Pakistanis often rally in favor of punishing those accused of blaspheming.  Nevertheless, VOA notes, “As government is committed to scrutinizing online contents, some rights activists charge that monitoring the internet will be a slippery slope.”  “The monitoring of social media for blasphemous content is a dangerous precedent in Pakistan. The law has often been misused in the past and now a crackdown on internet will further complicate the situation,” Zohra Yusuf, a Pakistani human rights activist, told Voice of America.  VOA learned that Pakistan might be using the controversial law as a pretext to silence dissent on the internet.",3.6,5,"[3.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.5, 1.5]"
1460,3107,11,6,2017,2017-11-06,Vox,Ted Cruz accidentally explained America’s gun problem in one sentence,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) on Monday threw out the typical conservative talking points following the mass shooting at a Sutherland Springs, Texas, church, arguing not to politicize the shooting and making some claims about “a good guy with a gun.” But in the process, he made — accidentally, it seems — a good case for gun control.  “Evil is evil is evil,” Cruz said on CNN, “and will use the weaponry that is available.”  This, it turns out, is exactly the point made by gun control advocates. There are bad people in every society in the world. The US is not unique in this regard, and I don’t think Cruz is saying that America is uniquely evil.  What Americans seem to have, instead, is extra stock of — and way more access to — incredibly deadly weapons in the form of firearms. And this stock and access give bad people an easier way to commit mass atrocities — more so than they’d be able to if they only had access to, say, a baseball bat or a knife.  As Zack Beauchamp explained for Vox, a breakthrough analysis in the 1990s by UC Berkeley’s Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins found that the US does not, contrary to the old conventional wisdom, have more crime in general than other Western industrial nations. Instead, the US appears to have more lethal violence — and that’s driven in large part by the prevalence of guns.  “A series of specific comparisons of the death rates from property crime and assault in New York City and London show how enormous differences in death risk can be explained even while general patterns are similar,” Zimring and Hawkins wrote. “A preference for crimes of personal force and the willingness and ability to use guns in robbery make similar levels of property crime 54 times as deadly in New York City as in London.”  This is in many ways intuitive: People of every country get into arguments and fights with friends, family, and peers. But in the US, it’s much more likely that someone will get angry at an argument, be able to pull out a gun, and kill someone.  This is, in short, America’s gun problem.  The research is clear: more guns, more gun deaths  While other developed countries impose very tough laws on guns, the US has some of the laxest laws in the world. As a result, it also has way more guns and, yes, gun deaths.  Consider: America has nearly six times the gun homicide rate of Canada, more than seven times that of Sweden, and nearly 16 times that of Germany, according to United Nations data compiled by the Guardian. (These gun deaths are a big reason America has a much higher overall homicide rate, which includes non-gun deaths, than other developed nations.)  At the same time, the US has by far the highest number of guns in the world. According to a 2007 estimate, the number of civilian-owned firearms in the US was 88.8 guns per 100 people, meaning there was almost one privately owned gun per American and more than one per American adult. The world's second-ranked country was Yemen, a quasi-failed state torn by civil war, where there were 54.8 guns per 100 people.  The research shows these two statistics are connected. Regularly updated reviews of the evidence compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health’s Injury Control Research Center have consistently found that when controlling for variables such as socioeconomic factors and other crime, places with more guns have more gun deaths.  “Within the United States, a wide array of empirical evidence indicates that more guns in a community leads to more homicide,” David Hemenway, the Injury Control Research Center’s director, wrote in Private Guns, Public Health.  For example, this chart, from a 2007 study by Harvard researchers, shows a correlation between statewide firearm homicide victimization rates and household gun ownership after controlling for robbery rates:  A more recent study from 2013, led by a Boston University School of Public Health researcher, reached similar conclusions: After controlling for multiple variables, the study found that a 1 percent increase in gun ownership correlated with a roughly 0.9 percent rise in the firearm homicide rate at the state level.  Stricter gun laws can help prevent such deaths. Last year, researchers from around the country reviewed more than 130 studies from 10 countries on gun control for Epidemiologic Reviews. This is, for now, the most current, extensive review of the research on the effects of gun control. The findings were clear: “The simultaneous implementation of laws targeting multiple firearms restrictions is associated with reductions in firearm deaths.”  The study did not look at one specific intervention, but rather a variety of kinds of gun control, from licensing measures to buyback programs. Time and time again, they found the same line of evidence: Reduced access to guns was followed by a drop in deaths related to guns. And while non-gun homicides also decreased, the drop wasn’t as quick as the one seen in gun-related homicides — indicating that access to guns was a potential causal factor.  To put it in Cruz’s terms, evil may always exist, but the research shows laws really can make it more difficult for evil people to get some of the world’s deadliest weapons — and that could save lives.",3.375,8,"[4.5, 4.5, 3.0, 4.5, 0.5, 5.0, 0.5, 4.5]"

The second, he said, was the Lautenberg Amendment.  “The real story is why, with these offenses, was he still able to buy a gun?” Mr. Christensen said. “He clearly should not have been able to.”  He noted that the military justice system uses different terminology than civilian criminal courts, which could explain why Mr. Kelley’s conviction was not reported. “That could be part of the problem here, our use of archaic terms that don’t translate well to the civilian world,” he said.  When Congress adopted the Lautenberg Amendment in 1996, the nation was in the mood to enact gun safety laws, said Richard Aborn, a longtime advocate for gun safety and the former president of the Brady Center, which advocates gun control. Lawmakers had already adopted a ban on military-style assault weapons — that law has since lapsed — and prohibited the purchase of large-capacity ammunition magazines.  But the Gun Control Act of 1968, which regulated the purchase of firearms, stipulated that only convicted felons could be prohibited from buying guns. “The question kept coming up, what about domestic violence, because its often a misdemeanor, and we knew that there was a linkage between gun violence and domestic violence,” Mr. Aborn said. “That was the birth of the whole conversation.”  But the law’s definition of who is a domestic abuser is “quite specific,” said Mr. Rosen, of the Everytown group. The measure requires, for example, that the victim and the abuser have to have been married or have had a child together, or have lived together. Thus the Lautenberg Amendment does not apply to people who are dating, which gives rise to what advocates call “the boyfriend loophole.”  Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, has introduced legislation that would close that loophole, and would also prevent stalkers from having guns. A 2014 report by the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress reviewed conviction records in 20 states, and found that nearly 12,000 people across the country had been convicted of misdemeanor-level stalking, but were still permitted to own guns.  “The Lautenberg Amendment was bare bones,” said Kim Gandy, the chief executive of the National Network to End Domestic Violence. “There are a lot of gaps in the instant criminal background check system; the data is only as good as what goes into it. So if the data is not in the system, obviously there is a giant loophole there.”",4.357142857142857,7,"[4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.0, 4.0]"

Based on preliminary reports, the gunman in Sutherland Springs, Tex., was a “very deranged individual,” he said. “We have a lot of mental health problems in our country, as do other countries.”  “But this isn’t a guns situation,” Mr. Trump added. “I mean, we could go into it, but it’s a little bit soon to go into it.

1457,3104,11,6,2017,2017-11-06,Vox,Read: Rep. Kevin Brady’s amendment to the House’s tax reform bill,"When House Republicans released their bill last Thursday morning — one day after they initially said they would — they said it was not the final product. Far from it.  On the first day of the bill’s markup, tax-focused Ways and Means Committee Chair Kevin Brady (R-TX) offered an amendment that would delay the repeal of tax-free savings accounts for dependent care and amend the tax on private university endowments to affect schools with endowments amassing to $250,000 per student, instead of $100,000 per student, among other changes.  After months releasing vague outlines and broad plans, House Republicans are finally working through legislative text on tax reform.  Their proposal radically cuts the corporate taxes, collapses individual tax rates from seven brackets to four, and substantially expands the standard deduction and child tax credit for individuals.  The bill reduced the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, expands the child tax credit from $1,000 to $1,600, caps the state and local property tax deduction at $10,000, leaves retirement savings accounts unchanged, and reduces the tax rate for small businesses to 25 percent.  Republicans, frantically hoping to pass tax reform by Christmas — for fear that their first year controlling both Congress and the White House will come to an end with no major legislative victories — have spent weeks debating behind closed doors and avoiding the tough decisions.  This bill is House Republicans’ opening bid on tax reform, a proposal that will likely undergo a lot of scrutiny from the party and outside interests. The Senate is expected to release its own version of the bill this week, and plans to go through markup as soon as the House has concluded theirs. Then Republicans must come to an agreement between the two chambers.  Overhauling the nation’s tax code comes with a lot of winners and losers, and as Obamacare repeal already showed, Republicans can’t just expect their members to fall in line on a major agenda item. The party is unified in its goal to cut taxes, but has been struggling within its ranks over how deeply to lower rates and whether to pay for the tax cuts.

1449,3096,11,6,2017,2017-11-06,Associated Press News,House tax panel adopts GOP changes after day of bickering,"House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, begins the markup process of the GOP's far-reaching tax overhaul as members propose amendments and changes to shape the first major revamp of the tax system in three decades, on Capitol Hill in Washington, Monday, Nov. 6, 2017. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)  WASHINGTON (AP) — After a day of partisan bickering over whether the Republicans’ sweeping tax plan would truly help the middle class, a key House panel on Monday approved late changes. Lawmakers restored the tax exemption for employees receiving child care benefits from their companies, but also put new requirements on a tax credit used by working people of modest means.  The House Ways and Means Committee voted 24-16 along party lines to adopt the amendment from its chairman, Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas. The changes were made to the complex GOP tax legislation put forward last Thursday.  The vote on the amendment capped a rancorous marathon session in which Republicans and Democrats argued heatedly over the nearly $6 trillion plan. Democrats repeatedly lodged objections to the bill, especially to its limits on prized deductions for homeowners and its repeal of the child adoption credit and the deduction for medical expenses.  It was the first of what are expected to be several days of work on the bill, as Republicans drive to push legislation through Congress and to President Donald Trump’s desk by Christmas.  Republicans focused on findings by Congress’ nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation that the bill would lower taxes across all income levels over the next several years.  “Clearly this is helping real people. It’s helping teachers, it’s helping students, it’s helping struggling families that are living paycheck to paycheck,” said GOP Rep. Erik Paulsen of Minnesota.  Democrats returned repeatedly to a section of the analysis showing taxes would actually go up beginning in 2023 for some 38 million taxpayers or families making $20,000 to $40,000 a year.  “There are a lot of people expecting a tax cut who would be big losers under this bill,” proclaimed Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey. “This is a joke and you’ve got to face up to it.”  At stake is whether the GOP will succeed in passing the most sweeping rewrite of the tax code in decades, which would be a major achievement for congressional Republicans and Trump after a year largely devoid of legislative wins. Looking ahead to 2018 midterms, Democrats and Republicans are both trying to win the debate over who is truly looking out for middle-class Americans.  The legislation adds $1.5 trillion to the ballooning national debt, delivers a major tax cut to corporations, and repeals the estate tax, which would benefit a tiny percentage of the wealthiest families in the country. It also simplifies the loophole-ridden tax code by collapsing today’s seven personal income tax brackets into four. It nearly doubles the standard deduction used by people who don’t itemize, and it increases the child tax credit, an element championed by first daughter Ivanka Trump.  Republicans argued vociferously that the legislation is targeted toward the middle class.  “It’s about making America’s economy stronger than ever by delivering more jobs, fairer taxes and bigger paychecks across the nation,” said Brady. He is aiming to push the legislation through committee and to the full House later this week, and GOP leaders are aiming for House passage before Thanksgiving.  The committee’s top Democrat, Richard Neal of Massachusetts, countered that the bill “puts the well-connected first while forcing millions of American families to watch while their taxes go up.” He complained that Republicans crafted it in private without input from Democrats.  The tax proposal is the first major rewrite of the U.S. tax code in three decades. After embarrassing failures to make good on years of promises to repeal “Obamacare,” the tax bill is enthusiastically backed by Trump, House GOP leaders and many rank-and-file Republicans, who are promising a simpler IRS code, a more globally competitive business tax structure, and tax cuts for the middle class and families with children.  But there’s considerable trepidation as well. In addition to the overall increases in later years for lower-income Americans, many earners in the upper-middle class, especially those from high-tax states, are facing tax increases. That’s because the measure would no longer permit taxpayers to deduct state income taxes from their federal taxes.  Powerful lobbyists are fighting to protect favored deductions, while a few well-financed interest groups, including the National Association of Homebuilders, have already vowed to oppose the legislation. The homebuilders group has voiced concerns over Republicans’ decision to lower the mortgage interest deduction from $1 million to $500,000.  ___  Associated Press writer Andrew Taylor contributed to this report.",3.323529411764706,17,"[4.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 0.5, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 3.0, 2.5, 1.0, 4.0, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 0.5, 1.5]"

(AP Photo/Shizuo Kambayashi, File)  TOKYO (AP) — Japanese internet and solar company SoftBank Group Corp. is raising its stake in Sprint Corp. after merger talks with T-Mobile collapsed, signaling its commitment to a turnaround at the U.S. wireless carrier.  Tokyo-based SoftBank reported Monday that July-September net profit tumbled to 113 billion yen ($991 million) from 528 billion yen a year ago.  Quarterly sales rose nearly 4 percent to 2.23 trillion yen ($19.5 billion) on improved results at Sprint, as well as revenue from Arm, a British chips company SoftBank acquired last year.  Helping bring profit lower was the absence of last year’s foreign-exchange gains, as well as derivative losses that came from its sale of part of its stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.  T-Mobile and Sprint are the third- and fourth-largest wireless carriers, respectively, in the U.S., but they are significantly smaller than AT&T and Verizon, which effectively have a duopoly over the U.S. wireless service.  Wireless carriers Sprint and T-Mobile called off a potential merger Saturday, saying the companies couldn’t come to an agreement that would benefit customers and shareholders.  The two companies have been dancing around a possible merger for years, and were again in the news in recent weeks with talks of them coming together after all. But in a joint statement Saturday, Sprint and T-Mobile said the negotiations were off for the foreseeable future.  Sprint has debt and has been losing money, but its results had been improving gradually, partly because of additional investments from SoftBank, which also sells the Pepper humanoid.  But both analysts and SoftBank had said they believed Sprint needs a deal, rather than trying to compete on its own.  But Washington regulators have frowned on a possible merger. D.C. spiked AT&T’s offer to buy T-Mobile in 2011, and signaled in 2014 they would have been against Sprint doing the same thing. But with the new Trump administration, it was thought regulators might be more relaxed about a merger.  SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son told reporters that the talks fell apart because T-Mobile did not want to be equal partners in management. But he insisted Sprint will prove a gold mine because of the move to IoT, where SoftBank’s investment in Arm will pay off, especially in the U.S.  “We are entering an era where billions of new connected devices and sensors will come online throughout the United States,” he said. “Sprint is a critical part of our plan to ensure that we can deliver our vision to American consumers and we are very confident in its future.”  Son said he felt “absolutely great” after the merger talks ended because worries over indecisiveness were gone.  “It was an important decision,” he said. “But the day will come when having Sprint will pay off.”  Although Arm’s sales grew from the previous year, its losses grew as well because of costs for hiring engineers.  Son, credited as a visionary and seen in the company of high-profile people like Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates and President Donald Trump, has been aggressive in investing in artificial intelligence, the internet of things and renewable energy.  Son has set up a $100 billion SoftBank Vision Fund specially for the technology sector with money from Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and other investors.  SoftBank’s Japanese mobile business continued to do well in the last quarter, increasing smartphone subscribers, according to the company. SoftBank was the first carrier in Japan to offer Apple’s iPhone.  It also owns the SoftBank Hawks baseball club, which recently won the Japan Series, this nation’s equivalent of the World Series.  ___  Yuri Kageyama can be reached at twitter.com/yurikageyama  Her work can be found at https://www.apnews.com/search/yuri%20kageyama",3.21875,16,"[4.0, 3.5, 0.5, 2.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 0.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 2.5, 4.0, 4.5]"

Silicon Beat reports that James Damore, who was fired from Google in August of 2017, has claimed that he was unfairly let go from the company. Breitbart News covered Damore’s viewpoint diversity memo and subsequent firing in-depth, leading to a series investigating the leftist workplace culture in Silicon Valley titled Rebels of Google. Under California law, employers can fire employees for virtually any reason they see fit, leading many to wonder how Damore would fight his unfair dismissal claim.  Silicon Beat has obtained Damore’s U.S. National Labor Relations Board charge sheet revealing Damore’s reasoning for doing legal battle with Google. Damore alleges that his memo, which discussed biological differences between men and women as well as Google’s oppressive leftist workplace culture and diversity hiring initiatives, was the reason for his firing. Damore seems to allege in his claim that it was his criticism of the company’s culture, which he feels persecuted conservative viewpoints, which led to his firing.  Damore’s Labour Board charge centers around Section 8(a) subsection (1) of the National Labor Relations Act, which states that employees have the right to engage in activities for “mutual aid or protection.” Damore is claiming that Google fired him “in retaliation” for his criticism of the company, something which is protected by law and to discourage other employees from performing similar actions, claims Damore. The protected actions listed by Damore are his communication with other employees about the companies workplace via his internal memo.  Sundar Pichai, Google’s CEO, has defended the company’s decision to fire Damore arguing that Damore perpetuated “harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace.” Google did not respond to a request for comment relating to Damore’s Labor Board charge but has previously stated that the company has “strong policies against retaliation, harassment, and discrimination in the workplace,” and supports employees rights to express themselves. In a previous statement on Damore, Google said, “an important part of our culture is lively debate. But like any workplace that doesn’t mean that anything goes.”",3.75,2,"[3.0, 4.5]"
1464,3111,11,6,2017,2017-11-06,Fox News,Congress opens door to nixing ObamaCare mandate in tax bill,"Top House Republicans have opened the door to using their sweeping tax bill to repeal ObamaCare's individual mandate, as they began retooling the tax proposal Monday in pursuit of a final version that can pass Congress.  House Speaker Paul Ryan, the top Republican in the GOP-controlled chamber, this weekend acknowledged that a measure to nix the requirement to buy health insurance could be included in the final tax package.  “We have an active conversation with our members and a whole host of ideas on things to add to this bill,” Ryan, R-Wis., told “Fox News Sunday.” “And that’s one of the things that’s being discussed.”  The mandate, which imposes a tax penalty on Americans who fail to buy insurance under ObamaCare, is considered a critical component of the 2010 health care law. While previous efforts to overhaul the law have failed, repealing just the mandate could have significant consequences.  Ryan attempted to make clear that House leadership isn’t driving the new repeal push. Rather, President Trump last week challenged Congress to end the mandate.  “Wouldn't it be great to Repeal the very unfair and unpopular Individual Mandate in ObamaCare and use those savings for further Tax Cuts for the Middle Class,” the president tweeted Wednesday, one day after House Republicans released their plan.  Trump’s request surprised congressional Republicans, considering they carefully crafted a tax plan with hopes it could pass the GOP-controlled House and Senate and even garner some bipartisan support. A mandate repeal could drive away wavering Democrats. But the call also comes as Americans face soaring premiums under the health law for 2018.  If successful, Trump could in part fulfill a major campaign promise to dismantle ObamaCare -- after the Senate failed this summer to pass a House-approved replacement plan.  “The president feels very strongly about including this at some step along the process. He’s told me that twice by phone and once in person,” Texas Rep. Kevin Brady, chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, said last week at a Politico forum.  The committee on Monday approved a “substitute” amendment introduced by Brady which replaces the old bill text. The substitute amendment does not include a repeal of the individual mandate. However, the House Ways and Means Committee has planned several days of “markup” sessions where members continue to craft the bill, line by line. This could continue through late Wednesday or early Thursday.  Fox News is told there is consternation from the House Republican leadership about adding a repeal of the mandate to the legislation. Part of the problem is that they don’t want to conflate health care with tax reform – since the resolution to the former went so poorly earlier this year. This could be added in the Rules Committee later on.  Repealing the mandate could reduce the federal deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars, even though it would end a steady tax-revenue stream for the federal government from fines.  Because Americans would no longer be forced to buy insurance, fewer would use federally funded Medicaid or require federal subsidies to pay for premiums, which would result in a net savings.  A report last year by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected that repealing the mandate starting in 2018 would by 2026 reduce federal budget deficits by roughly $400 billion.  The idea of nixing the mandate in the tax bill is being touted by Arkansas GOP Sen. Tom Cotton.  “I have what I would call maybe a creative idea, a novel idea,” Cotton said last week. “We can repeal the individual mandate of ObamaCare and save $300 to $400 billion dollars. … That's not my math. That's the math of the Congressional Budget Office.”  Brady has asked the CBO for a new analysis, which could be released as early as this week.  However, ending the individual mandate doesn’t appear to have support among congressional Democrats, particularly in the Senate where Republicans have just a 52-48 member majority.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer hasn’t outright opposed repealing the mandate in the GOP tax overhaul bill but has suggested the idea could itself kill the plan.  “A lot of the Republicans said this bill is too heavy a lift already,” the New York Democrat told reporters Friday. “To add that to it might be the straw that would break the camel’s back even further. So I think it is unlikely that they would add that. “  “It has been more than three decades since America’s tax code was reformed under President Ronald Reagan,” Brady said. “Our committee has dedicated a substantial amount of time, energy, and work to the pursuit of one landmark goal -- delivering comprehensive tax reform to the American people.”  Fox News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.",4.666666666666667,3,"[5.0, 4.5, 4.5]"

Or is the slowdown just routine haggling over dollars and cents?” asked Recode in an article on the tension. “According to people with knowledge of the process, it’s mostly the latter, with the main stumbling block still revolving around price.”  At a conference on Wednesday, SoftBank Chief Dealmaker Jeff Housenbold announced, “We’re very valuation sensitive. We’ve walked away from a number of deals recently because we didn’t like the valuation.”  Despite this, Housenbold added, “In the grand scheme of things, if we have a belief that this could be the next $400-billion company, arguing over a pre-money valuation of $1.8 billion or $1.9 billion isn’t really that relevant to us.”  Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

While Trump will be looking to use his trip to strengthen Washington’s alliance with Seoul and reaffirm their joint push to maximize pressure on North Korea over its nuclear program, he will also be faced with several thorny issues weighing on the relationship. (AP Photo/Lee Jin-man, File)  SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — President Donald Trump arrived in South Korea on Tuesday on the second leg of his first official Asian tour. While Trump will be looking to use his trip to strengthen Washington’s alliance with Seoul and reaffirm their joint push to maximize pressure on North Korea over its nuclear program, he will also be faced with several thorny issues weighing on the relationship. Here’s a look at some of them.  __  NORTH KOREA  Both Trump and South Korea’s liberal President Moon Jae-in agree that it’s time to ramp up sanctions and pressure on North Korea, which has ignored international condemnation as it moves forward with its nuclear and missile tests.  But Moon, a former human rights lawyer, still favors dialogue as a way to defuse the nuclear tension and vehemently opposes a potential military clash, which experts believe would cause enormous casualties in South Korea. This contrasts with Trump, who has threatened the North with “fire and fury” and exchanged warlike rhetoric with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.  The world will be watching what kind of language Trump will use in his comments on North Korea. A hint at a military option or crude insults directed at Kim — like the term “Little Rocket Man” he previously used to deride the young North Korean dictator — is certain to enrage North Korea, which could react with weapons tests and threats of war.  Increasing animosity would be a burden for Moon.  __  TRADE  Renegotiating South Korea’s bilateral free trade agreement with the U.S., dubbed KORUS, is likely be high on the agenda during the Trump-Moon summit. Trump has criticized the deal as a source of the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea, an argument officials there dismiss.  Before Trump’s presidency, many in South Korea and the United States regarded the deal as a key pillar of their alliance. But Trump has made scrapping trade deals a hallmark of his presidency. Earlier this year, reports that Trump was considering triggering a withdrawal from the deal caused uproar not just in South Korea but also in the United States.  The two countries eventually started talks this summer on renegotiating the deal, which went into effect five years ago. Many South Koreans are watching if Trump will make off-the-cuff remarks on the trade deal during news conferences or on Twitter.  __  U.S. TROOPS  Trump wants South Korea to pay more for the U.S. military presence on its soil, which is chiefly aimed at deterring potential aggression from North Korea.  During election campaigning, Trump said South Korea and Japan must make more contributions for together hosting 80,000 U.S. troops or he might withdraw those soldiers. Security jitters subsequently flared among many in South Korea and Japan.  Since taking office in January, Trump hasn’t publicly threatened to pull out the troops but he harkened back to an election campaign request for greater burden-sharing with South Korea during his first summit talks with Moon in late June.  South Korea currently pays more than 900 billion won ($800 million) annually and negotiations with the United States are to start in the coming months to try to determine a new amount for South Korea to contribute.  __  U.S. MISSILE DEFENSE  South Korea’s recent agreement with China to try to end disputes over an advanced U.S. missile defense system deployed in South Korea could be an issue.  While announcing the deal last week, Beijing, which views the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system as a security threat, said it noted that Seoul stated it won’t do several things: deploying an additional THAAD battery, helping develop security cooperation with Japan and the U.S. into a trilateral military alliance and joining a global U.S. missile defense network. South Korea’s foreign minister made similar remarks during a parliament committee meeting earlier last week.  Critics say the South Korean moves, dubbed by local media as its “Three No” policies, could undermine the operational capability of the allied South Korea-U.S. forces and Trump’s push to bolter three-way cooperation with Seoul and Tokyo to put more pressure on Pyongyang.  Other issues at stake are South Korea’s hope to regain the wartime operational control of its troops, currently placed at the hands of the chief of the 28,000 U.S. troops in the South, and Seoul’s possible purchase of high-tech U.S. weapons systems.  __  Associated Press writer Youkyung Lee contributed to this report.  ___  This story has been corrected to show that Trump’s first summit with South Korea’s president took place in June, not July.",4.0,3,"[4.0, 5.0, 3.0]"

Trump is on a five country trip through Asia traveling to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. (Kiyoshi Ota/Pool Photo via AP)  TOKYO (AP) — Responding to a U.S. mass shooting for the second time in six weeks, President Donald Trump said Monday that it wasn’t “a guns situation” that was behind the slayings of more than two dozen worshippers at a Texas church a day earlier.  As he did following last month’s Las Vegas massacre of 58 people, Trump resisted any discussion of gun control during a news conference in Tokyo, where he was beginning his first presidential trip to Asia. Instead, Trump characterized the shooting as a “mental health problem at the highest level.” Yet White House officials said Trump is unlikely to call for a specific policy response, as he did after last week’s Islamic State group-inspired truck attack, which killed eight people in New York City.  Devin Kelley, the Texas gunman, was discharged from the Air Force several years ago for assaulting his spouse and a child, the Air Force said.  “This was a very — based on preliminary reports — a very deranged individual. A lot of problems over a long period of time,” Trump said when asked about the shooting as he and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe held a joint news conference.  Speaking from Tokyo, President Donald Trump called the deadly church shooting in Texas Sunday ""an act of evil."" (Nov. 5)  Trump’s more muted response to gun violence contrasts with his swift call for legislative and military action following the Oct. 31 truck attack in New York City. Within hours of a rental truck ramming through a crowded bicycle path and into a school bus, Trump called for Congress to “immediately” repeal the diversity visa lottery program that suspect Sayfullo Saipov, an Uzbekistan citizen, used to enter the country in 2010. Trump also claimed that the U.S. had already stepped up its retaliation against the Islamic State group after the attack.  “We are hitting them 10 times harder,” he said Friday.  After the Las Vegas shooting, Trump and aides said it was inappropriate to consider a policy response while people were still grieving. Despite days later suggesting openness to outlawing the bump stock device that allowed Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock to fire at near-automatic rates, the Trump administration has shown no signs of urgency.  “He has asked that that process be reviewed, and we’re waiting on some of the details of that to take place,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Oct. 27 when asked about bump stocks. “But a decision hasn’t been finalized on that. ”  Trump, who supported gun control before reversing his position to enter the Republican presidential primary, courted the National Rifle Association’s endorsement in 2016, and earlier this year became the first president in three decades to speak at the gun group’s annual convention.  In February, Trump signed legislation reversing an Obama-era regulation that would have made it harder for Americans with mental illnesses to buy a gun.  Under the Obama rule, the Social Security Administration would have been required to send in the names of beneficiaries with mental impairments who needed a third party to manage their financial affairs. The rule would have affected an estimated 75,000 beneficiaries who would have been added to the national background check database.  The attack happened in South Texas on Sunday morning when a man dressed in black tactical-style gear and armed with an assault rifle opened fire inside a Baptist church in a small community, killing 26 people and wounding 20 others in the deadliest mass shooting in state history.  As Kelley left the scene, authorities said, he was confronted by an armed resident. Kelley later was found dead in his vehicle.  Trump said, “Fortunately somebody else had a gun that was shooting in the opposite direction, otherwise it (wouldn’t) have been as bad as it was. It would have been much worse.”  Investigators believe Kelley shot himself.  ___  Associated Press writers Kevin Freking, Catherine Lucey and Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this report.",3.625,12,"[4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.0, 0.5, 1.5, 5.0, 4.5, 3.0, 4.0, 3.5]"

Senior Adviser Doug Stafford said it is unclear when the Republican senator will return to work since he is in “considerable pain” and has difficulty getting around, including flying. Stafford said this type of injury is marked by severe pain that can last for weeks to months.  “This type of injury is caused by high velocity severe force,” Stafford said a statement to Fox News.  The Bowling Green Daily News reported that an arrest warrant said Paul told police his neighbor came on his property and tackled him from behind Friday, forcing him to the ground, all while the senator had been mowing his lawn. He had trouble breathing because of the rib injury, the warrant said.  A Warren County official did not immediately respond to a request from The Associated Press for a copy of the arrest warrant.  Police arrested 59-year-old Rene Boucher on Saturday and charged him with misdemeanor fourth-degree assault with a minor injury. Boucher lives next door to Paul and his wife, according to Warren County property records.  Boucher was released from jail Saturday on a $7,500 bond. He has a court date scheduled for Thursday. Boucher did not return a phone call from The Associated Press seeking comment. It is unclear if he has an attorney.  “Displaced rib fractures can lead to life-threatening injuries such as: hemopneumothorax, pneumothorax, pneumonia, internal bleeding, laceration of internal organs and lung contusions. Senator Paul does have lung contusions currently,” Stafford explained.  Sunday’s disclosures come a day after Paul’s office said the senator was fine and characterized his injuries as minor.  Paul and his wife, Kelley, “appreciate everyone’s thoughts and well wishes and he will be back fighting for liberty in the Senate soon,” Stafford said.  Paul was the lone GOP nay on the budget framework for tax reform, although his position on tax reform itself appears to be on the edge. The Trump administration has suggested that Paul is a yea on tax reform. The GOP only can lose two votes on tax reform before needing Vice President Mike Pence to break a tie.  Paul’s health could be another factor in the White House’s race to finish tax reform ― along with the health of Sens. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., and John McCain, R-Ariz.  Boucher is an anesthesiologist and a pain specialist. He invented the “Therm-A-Vest,” a cloth vest partially filled with rice that when heated can be worn to relieve back pain, according to a 2005 article from the Bowling Green Daily News.  A spokeswoman for Paul said he was “blindsided” by the attack, but did not provide more details. Police have not said what motivated the attack. Kentucky State Police Master Trooper Jeremy Hodges said the FBI is checking to see if the attack was politically motivated.  FBI spokesman David Habich said the agency is aware of the incident and is “working with our state and local partners to determine if there was a violation of federal law.”  The attack was a shock for the community in Bowling Green, where a neighbor says he would often see Paul and Boucher out walking their dogs on the normally quiet streets. Jim Skaggs, a member of the state Republican Party executive committee, lives in the neighborhood and has known both men for years. He said they disagreed politically, but was shocked to hear of the incident.  “They were as far left and right as you can be,” Skaggs said. “We had heard of no friction whatsoever other than they just were difference of political opinion.

Bush Was ‘Single Most Destructive President in U.S. History, Including James Buchanan’","On Breitbart News Sunday with SiriusXM hosts Joel Pollak and Rebecca Mansour, Breitbart News Executive Chairman Steve Bannon was sharply critical of the Bush family, referring to them as “the last Whigs” because “the Republican Party that they talked about is essentially over.”  Bannon was referring to the Bush presidents attacking President Donald Trump in a new book, The Last Republicans: Inside the Extraordinary Relationship Between George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush by historian Mark Updegrove.  “Listen, I try to be bad cop to President Trump’s good cop. He’s head of the Republican Party. He tries to stay above the fray. Hopefully I’m there to do the dirty work as his wingman,” Bannon said.  “What are we talking about? This party is a party made up of workers. It’s made up of American workers. It’s made of the American middle class. It’s got to represent not just their values, but their interests, and it doesn’t. The donors, the conservative consultants, the lobbyists, and the politicians they bought in the Republican Party don’t represent their interests at all. It’s quite shocking,” he contended.  “I think now with the Internet and news services like Breitbart, the Daily Caller, and others you’ve disintermediated the kind of old think tanks of the conservative movement, and you’ve disintermediated the old media companies – including Fox News to a large extent, which is really quite Establishment. I think you just have this energy at the grassroots level that really wants to take its party back, and by taking its party back, really effectuate change in the United States. I think it’s healthy, and I think it’s great,” he said.  “Look, it’s all about elections. If you’ve got a better idea and a better candidate, you know, throw down and let’s see if you can win,” he invited.  Bannon handicapped that hypothetical race as one in which Team Bush would not fare well.  “I think the energy is on the grassroots side,” he said. “I realize they use my name as kind of a Darth Vader figure to scare little children, or at least donors, to write bigger checks. But I think the power of what the grassroots has done, it’s turned their money from their biggest asset into their biggest liability. And now in a situation where the Karl Roves and the geniuses around Mitch McConnell, the more money they spend, the fewer votes they get.”  “They’re in full panic,” he added. “The Bushes are triggered by Donald Trump. They personally, obviously, detest him. I hear this book’s going to actually say that Bush 41 actually voted for Hillary Clinton, and Bush 43 didn’t vote at all. If that’s the case, and you think of what the Clintons stand for, and how we lost this country with judges and policies, and what we’re doing throughout the world with our sovereignty, and think of those people at the Remembrance Project – so many of whom died on George Bush’s watch – it’s just disgusting.”  “If that’s what they think, then they should move on, because they certainly don’t belong in the Republican Party that reflects the values and the interests of working people, working men and women throughout the country who I couldn’t be prouder come to the pages of Breitbart, and are basically the backbone of the listening audience at Breitbart News Sunday,” said Bannon.  Mansour suggested the “thinness and smallness” of the debate within the Republican Party before the advent of Donald Trump and his issues prevented it from making inroads with the working-class electorate.  “They make these speeches, and they string together these kinds of happy-clappy phrases, but it doesn’t really get down to the nuts and bolts of it,” Bannon said. “People are tired of hearing rhetoric. Really what they want to hear is what your action plan is, and what it means.”  “It says something about Bush that Bush is here attacking, once again attacking President Trump and being just as vitriolic as possible. I’ll reiterate this: I think President Bush 43 will go down in history as the single most destructive in the United States – and I include James Buchanan in that, the president before the Civil War,” he asserted.  “Now, what do I mean by that? He had three major policy initiatives that virtually destroyed the country. Number One was the Iraq war, $6 trillion in Iraq and Afghanistan, the wars still haven’t been won. Iraq is as big of a disaster as it’s ever been. It’s caused total chaos in the Middle East. And it was either he outright lied to the American people or he’s just totally incompetent and misread what the information was,” he charged.  “The second was the financial crisis,” Bannon continued. “The financial crisis happened on his watch. It came to a head in September 2008. He just walked away from it, didn’t come up with any solutions. The thing was a debacle. We still suffer from that today. The solution was to, you know, flood the zone with liquidity, trillions and trillions of dollars of liquidity have inflated assets and made the owners of equity and real estate filthy rich, and the working men and women of this country have gotten stiffed after they had to pay for the bailouts.”  “But the most important part of what he was destructive about is China. It was on his watch they really set in motion Most Favored Nation and getting into the WTO. I know the Clintons pushed that and tried to implement it, but Bush looked at China, the whole Bush administration said China is going to get wealthier, is becoming more democratic, and more free-market capitalist. That was a massive, massive mistake,” he said.  “China today is a competitor-slash-enemy, having economic warfare against us, of incalculable power. That started with the Bush administration. He is the single most destructive president in the history of the country, and I include James Buchanan in that. For him to come and attack President Trump is an absolute disgrace,” Bannon concluded.  LISTEN:",1.8,5,"[0.5, 2.0, 0.5, 5.0, 1.0]"

During a speech at the Remembrance Project conference, an organization that represents the illegal alien crime victims’ families, Bannon blasted the Bush dynasty, calling out President George W.

Where is Jeb Bush? Where were all these guys? Bush… Bush… Old man Bush – and the son today got a book out, you know. ‘The demise of the Republican Party, this Republican Party is falling apart.

I don’t care how long you wear the boots, brother. You’re a Yankee brahmin, okay.  Bannon also slammed the employers of illegal aliens, the mainstream media, and the Democratic Party for not only turning a blind eye to illegal immigration but incentivizing more of it.  “Here’s the bottom line … here’s why it happened and here’s why it’s continuing to happen: People make money off it,” Bannon said. “They want the cheap labor, right. The Democratic Party wants the votes. Media’s prepared to look the other way. You know why? You guys don’t count. If you think you count, you’re kidding yourselves. You don’t count. You should count, that’s the way the country was founded.”  As Breitbart News recently reported, under President George W. Bush, more than 30,000 illegal aliens were allowed at one time to enter the United States following Hurricane Katrina in order to take American blue-collar jobs that would have otherwise gone to U.S. workers who had been devastated by the storm.

1479,3146,11,6,2017,2017-11-06,100 Percent Fed Up,HOW CAN ANYONE TRUST THEM? TWITTER Admits To Hiding ANTI-HILLARY and Negative DNC Tweets During Election ,"Can someone please remind us how “fake news” and collusion between Trump and the Russians affected the outcome of the election?  The move by a Twitter employee last week to ban President Trump from the social media platform for 11 minutes received a great deal of attention and offered people a glimpse into how easily someone at Twitter can stop the flow of information from a source he does not like.  What did not get a great deal of attention, however, was the fact that Twitter’s Acting General Counsel, Sean Edgett, admitted in a prepared statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee that the platform regularly blocked tweets offering information that could paint the Clinton Campaign and DNC in negative lights.  Trending: AMERICA’S BIGGEST LOSER Explains Why Multiple Sexual Assault Claims Against Bill Clinton Are Not As Serious As Kavanaugh’s…Calls For CIVIL WAR! [VIDEO]  Writing for NewsWars, Jerome Corsi notes:   Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court? Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?  Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court? * Yes, he will be confirmed. No, he will not be confirmed.       At a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism on Tuesday, Sean Edgett, Acting General Counsel for Twitter, admitted in his prepared testimony that Twitter employed in the 2016 election algorithms that censored out hashtags critical (of) Hillary Clinton, including the hashtag #PodestaEmails and the hashtag #DNCLeaks.  Is anyone surprised?  Twitter execs long ago began showing their biases against conservatives to such an extent that even USA Today brought it up, noting that Twitter’s behind-the-scenes team was quick to ban right-wingers like Milo Yiannopoulos for digs he made at the brilliant and ever-so-entertaining actress Leslie Jones.  Yet, conservatives say, nothing happened to rapper Talib Kweli and his followers when they attacked black Breitbart reporter Jerome Hudson with racial slurs. When Breitbart contributor Kassy Dillon complained about a Twitter user who sent her harassing tweets and messages, Twitter made the perpetrator delete one tweet that suggested someone shoot Dillon in the head.  Now, the big story that many in the pop media evidently don’t want you to see is that Twitter actually admits to having censored tweets that might have spread real information injurious to HRC and the DNC during the 2016 election. The Twits claim that they were simply stopping “spambots’ from filling their precious space with tweets from unreal people (one might ask how authentic most politicians seem to be in the first place, but that’s a different matter), but hidden in their statements are some “tells” that indicate otherwise.  For example, Dr. Corsi observes that in sworn testimony to the Judiciary Committee, Edgett stated:  For example, our automated spam detection systems helped mitigate the impact of automated Tweets promoting the #PodestaEmails hashtag, which originated with Wikileaks’ publication of thousands of emails from the Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s Gmail account. The core of the hashtag was propagated by Wikileaks, whose account sent out a series of 118 original Tweets containing variants on the hashtag #PodestaEmails referencing the daily installments of the emails released on the Wikileaks website.  So, automatically, what Mr. Edgett has admitted tells us that Twitter intentionally tried to stop the circulation of information offered by an authentic user, Wikileaks, offering authentic information that Wikileaks had published revealing real, confirmed e-mails sourced from John Podesta and the DNC. Those e-mails shed extremely important information about corruption within the DNC that worked against Bernie Sanders’ campaign, and in favor of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, and later revealed extremely important information about what Mrs. Clinton knew about the attempted overthrow of Syria and the underlying, unconstitutional reasons for the overthrow of Qaddafi in Libya.  Edgett also testified that Twitter hid 25% of the “#PodestaEmails” tweets, and  As described in greater detail below, our systems detected and hid just under half (48%) of the Tweets relating to variants of another notable hashtag, #DNCLeak, which concerned the disclosure of leaked emails from the Democratic National Committee.  Those would be the e-mails that revealed towering corruption at the DNC and in many offices of pop media — things like new reporters working with the Clinton campaign to offer her easy questions, things like Donna Brazile, then an employee of CNN, feeding Hillary questions prior to a debate with the electrifying wildman, Bernie Sanders.  These are issues that were real, and the more people knew about them, the more they disliked Mrs. Clinton – and the more she and the DNC hackmeisters pushed the spurious “Russia Hack” narrative to deflect from their own malfeasance.

Speaking at the Web Summit in Lisbon, the theoretical physicist said AI has the potential to be the best or worst thing humanity has ever seen and the scary reality is we just don’t know which yet.  “We cannot know if we will be infinitely helped by AI or ignored by it and sidelined, or conceivably destroyed by it,” he said.  The Cambridge professor said while AI could be hugely beneficial for reducing poverty, disease and restoring the natural environment, it’s impossible to predict “what we might achieve when our own minds are amplified by AI”.  “AI could be the worst invention of the history of our civilization, that brings dangers like powerful autonomous weapons or new ways for the few to oppress the many.”  “AI could develop a will of its own, a will that is in conflict with ours and which could destroy us. In short, the rise of powerful AI will be either the best, or the worst thing ever to happen to humanity.”  Addressing the crowd of engineers and tech workers at the “vanguard” of AI development, Hawking warned they needed to focus on maximizing benefits for society rather than pure capability.  “We need to employ effective management in all areas of its development,” he said. “We stand on a threshold of a brave new world. It is an exciting, if precarious place to be and you are the pioneers.”  The address set the scene for three days of talks between high-profile tech, business and government leaders grappling with ethical implications of everything from self-driving cars to sex dolls.  Web Summit founder Paddy Cosgrove called tech’s current crossroads the “kind of inflection point that happens once in several lifetimes.” High-profile speakers including United Nations Secretary General Antonito Guterres and European Union’s commissioner for Competition Margarethe Vestager also took the stage on Monday and joined calls for an ethical approach that reduces inequality.  Kernel founder Bryan Johnson, who has plowed $100 million into his company to “hack the human brain,” agrees we’re on the threshold of the “most consequential revolution in the history of the human race.”  “The future is like a Category 5 hurricane that’s going to bear down on us with so much force the single greatest thing we can do as a species is work on our adaptability to change,” he said.  The European Union’s competition commissioner Vestager, who has fined Apple $19 billion over unpaid taxes in Ireland and Google $3.6 billion for disadvantaging others with its algorithm, said the main challenge for governments is to develop the tools to keep up with the rapid pace of change.  “We have to take our democracy back and renew it, because society is about people and not about technology,” she said. “You cannot just say what happens in the black box stays in the black box.”  This story originally appeared in news.com.au.",4.25,4,"[4.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.0]"

The latest such scam to come to our attention has Netflix members in its sights — all 109 million of them — and it looks pretty genuine at first glance.  Picked up by Australian web and email security firm MailGuard, the subject line of the email reads “Your suspension notification.”  If the email makes it through your filters and into your inbox and you decide to take a look, you’ll see that the scammers are trying to make you believe Netflix is having an issue validating your billing information.  A note declaring that your Netflix account will be suspended if you don’t respond within 48 hours aims to persuade you to click on the “restart membership” button at the end of the message.  It’s all baloney.  Click on the link and, surprise surprise, you’ll end up on a fake Netflix site where you’ll be asked to enter your login details along with other personal details, including your credit card information.  Once the scammers have all the data they’re after, the tricked Netflix subscriber is shown the message, “Your membership has been reactivated.”  In a statement issued on Monday, Netflix insisted it takes members’ online security seriously, and that it “employs numerous proactive measures to detect fraudulent activity to keep the Netflix service and our members’ accounts secure.”  The video-streaming giant added: “Unfortunately, these scams are common on the internet and target popular brands such as Netflix and other companies with large customer bases to lure users into giving out personal information.”  As usual, always be sure to double check any emails purporting to be from a company that you have a relationship with, especially if it’s asking you to click on a link within the message. Ignore the “sender” name and look for the actual email address (check it letter for letter, including the top-level domain that comes after the final dot) that the sender is using so that you can confirm their identity. You can do this by hovering over the sender’s name, though some email clients will display the actual address as well.  If you’re still not sure, you can open a new browser page and log in to the service from its homepage to check for messages via your account page, or simply contact the company directly about the issue mentioned in the email to find out if it’s genuine.

He also commended Trump’s efforts in leading the “international collaboration and unity” in dealing with the North.  President Donald Trump, speaking in Japan, said the shooting that killed 26 people in a church near San Antonio, Texas is the result of a 'mental health problem at the highest level. (Nov. 6)  Moon says, “I hope that your visit to Korea and to the Asia Pacific region will serve as an opportunity to relieve some of the anxiety that the Korean people have due to North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missiles.” He added that he also hopes it will “serve as a turning point in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue.”  ___  3:45 p.m.  President Donald Trump says he expects a “successful day of talks” in South Korea.  Trump is appearing alongside South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in at the Blue House in Seoul before a series of meetings on Tuesday.  Trump says it was an “honor” to be there and he’s “happy to see such spirit.” The US president did not directly reference the rising tensions with North Korea.  Trump’s two-day visit is centered on pressuring the North to abandon its nuclear weapons program. Trump has repeatedly struck a hard line against Pyongyang and South Korea was warily watching Trump as he was poised to deliver bellicose warnings in the shadow of the North Korea.  __  3:30 p.m.  President Donald Trump is visiting the Blue House in Seoul for meetings with South Korea’s President Moon Jae-In.  Trump’s visit to the Blue House began with a formal arrival ceremony. The two leaders will hold meetings, followed by a “friendship walk.” Trump and Moon will also hold a joint press conference before Trump and his wife are feted at a state dinner.  Traveling to the Blue House, Trump passed crowds of protesters waving US and South Korean flags. Some waved signs that said “war no” and “no Trump, no war, yes peace.”  __  2:05 p.m.  President Donald Trump is expressing hope that the tensions along the Korean peninsula “will all work out” as he meets with military leaders in South Korea.

He is telling reporters it will “all work out because it always works out. It has to work out.”  Trump’s trip to South Korea is focused on pressuring the north to abandon its nuclear weapons program.  The president says he’ll also be meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in about trade. He says “hopefully that will start working out” to create a lot of jobs in the U.S.  __  1:40 p.m.  President Donald Trump is having lunch with the troops at a military base in South Korea.  Trump arrived at Camp Humphreys, a military base about 40 miles south of Seoul Tuesday. He sat down with service members at a long table in a dining hall. South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in was also seated at the table.  Trump chatted with the troops and told reporters, “good food.”  Officials have said the base visit is meant to underscore the countries’ ties and South Korea’s commitment to contributing to its own defense. Burden-sharing is a theme Trump has stressed ever since his presidential campaign.  Trump is on a two-day visit to South Korea. It is the second country he is visiting on a five country Asian tour.  __  12:20 p.m.  President Donald Trump has arrived in South Korea amid escalating tensions with North Korea.  Air Force One landed at Osan Air Base in South Korea on Tuesday.  Trump’s first stop will be Camp Humphreys, where he is scheduled to have lunch with troops from the United States and the Republic of Korea and receive an operational briefing.  He and first lady Melania Trump will then head to Seoul, where they’ll participate in an arrival ceremony at the Blue House before Trump sits down for meetings with President Moon Jae-In. After tea and a “friendship walk,” the two leaders are set to hold a joint press conference before Trump and his wife are feted at a state dinner.  The stop is Trump’s second on a 12-day tour of Asia.  __  11: 45 a.m.  South Korean police are on the highest alert as critics and supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump are planning rallies in Seoul during his visit.  An official from the National Police Agency says more than 15,000 officers will be deployed to provide security during Trump’s visit and monitor the demonstrations.  Officers in fluorescent green jackets are installing steel fences around a designated protest zone at a boulevard near Seoul’s U.S. embassy and patrolling nearby streets.  Many South Koreans are concerned that Trump’s fiery rhetoric on North Korea, which has included threats of military options, is raising risks of war on the Korean Peninsula. Others are supportive of Trump’s tough stance against the North, which has been accelerating its nuclear weapons and missile tests.  __  6:45 a.m.  President Donald Trump says he and South Korean President Moon Jae-in “will figure it all out” when it comes to North Korea.  Trump is tweeting before he departs Tokyo for Seoul Tuesday morning — the second stop of his 12-day trip to Asia.  Trump says he’s, “Getting ready to leave for South Korea and meetings with President Moon, a fine gentleman” and adds the two “will figure it all out!”  The president is working to rally international pressure against the North, and its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.  Trump has said all options remain on the table, including a military response.  ___  6:25 a.m.  President Donald Trump is striking a hard line against North Korea’s nuclear weapons program and urging Japan to do the same.  Trump has closed out two days of talks, dinner and golf diplomacy with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (shin-zoh AH’-bay). He is traveling from Tokyo to South Korea Tuesday.  Trump is refusing to rule out eventual military action against North Korea and exhorting dictator Kim Jong Un to stop weapons testing, calling the recent launches of missiles over Japanese territory “a threat to the civilized world and international peace and stability.”  Trump says Abe had agreed to purchase “massive amounts of military equipment, as he should,” arguing the U.S. makes the “best military equipment, by far.”  ___  12:50 a.m.  Japan’s Foreign Ministry says Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife Akie have given a table runner adorned with golden embroidery to President Donald Trump, known for his affinity for gold. It was made by Kyoto-based fabric maker Tatsumura Textile. Abe also gave Melania Trump a bracelet with Japanese motifs. And Abe gave presidential daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump a set of face brushes. Ivanka Trump visited Japan last week.  Abe also gave Trump a golf cap that the both leaders signed that reads: “Donald & Shinzo, Make alliance even greater.” The cap also was autographed by Hideki Matsuyama, a Japanese professional golfer who played with the two leaders on Sunday.  ___  12:10 a.m.  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says he and President Donald Trump have drawn considerable attention to golf, but the Japanese leader is giving credit to their predecessors for pioneering golf diplomacy.  Abe says his grandfather, former prime minister Nobusuke Kishi, played with then-President Dwight Eisenhower in 1957 before their talks in Washington.  According to archival photos, Eisenhower won that match, shooting 74 to Kishi’s 99. Their second golf game was planned for 1960 never happened because Kishi resigned amid intensifying protest over a revised security pact he signed.  Abe and Trump had their second golf game on Sunday. Abe says their scores are a secret.  He says when someone plays golf with another person twice, that person must be “your favorite guy.”  ___  8:24 p.m.  President Donald Trump says Japan’s leader enthusiastically sought a relationship.  Speaking at a banquet in Tokyo Monday, Trump recalled that after his 2016 victory he heard from numerous world leaders, including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Trump said he didn’t know that it was customary to wait to meet other leaders until after you take office, and he told Abe he’d be happy to meet with him “any time.”  The president said that when he tried to delay, Abe was already on a plane to New York, “so I had to see him.” Trump said they had a great meeting and Abe “brought me the most beautiful golf club I’ve ever seen.”  Trump says he enjoyed “every minute” of his visit to Japan — the first stop on a five-country Asian tour.  ___  6 p.m.  President Donald Trump is ratcheting up the pressure on North Korea, refusing to rule out eventual military action and declaring that the United States “will not stand” for Pyongyang menacing America or its Asian allies.  Trump, on the first stop of his lengthy Asia trip, is denouncing North Korea Monday as “a threat to the civilized world.”  He exhorted dictator Kim Jong Un to cease weapons testing like the missiles he has fired over Japanese territory in recent weeks.  Trump did not modulate his fiery language on North Korea, declaring that Pyongyang imperiled “international peace and stability.”  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed with Trump’s assessment that “all options are on the table.”",3.4375,8,"[5.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.0, 2.5, 2.0, 3.5]"

(Kim Hong-ji/Pool Photo via AP)  SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — President Donald Trump said efforts to curb North Korea’s nuclear weapons program would be “front and center” of his two-day visit to South Korea and he projected optimism that the rising tensions could be abated peacefully.  Trump repeatedly addressed interlocking issues of security and trade at the heart of his visit after arriving Tuesday, saying he would be meeting with generals about North Korea. “Ultimately it will all work out. Because it always works out. It has to work out,” he said.  And later, after receiving a formal welcome from South Korean President Moon Jae-in, Trump also praised Seoul’s expansive purchases of American military equipment, which he said goes a long way to making the trade relationship between the two nations more equitable.  Moon said he hoped Trump’s visit would be an opportunity to resolve “anxiety” in the region over North Korea.  “I know that you have put this issue at the top of your security agenda,” Moon said at the presidential residence known as the Blue House, “so I hope that your visit to Korea and to the Asia Pacific region will serve as an opportunity to relieve some of the anxiety that the Korean people have due to North Korea’s provocations and also serve as a turning point in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue.”  President Donald Trump, speaking in Japan, said the shooting that killed 26 people in a church near San Antonio, Texas is the result of a 'mental health problem at the highest level. (Nov. 6)  Trump, in his own brief remarks, said Pyongyang would be “front and center” of discussions but avoided the fiery language he has used so often against North Korea and its dictator, Kim Jong Un.  The president also said he had a “terrific” meeting scheduled on trade, adding, “hopefully that’ll start working out and working out so that we create lots of jobs in the United States, which is one of the very important reasons I’m here.”  Trump, during a visit to Camp Humphreys that began his visit, sat with troops for lunch in a large mess hall. Moon was also seated at the table. “Good food,” Trump told reporters as he chatted with U.S. and Korean service members.  U.S. and South Korean officials have said the base visit was meant to underscore the countries’ ties and South Korea’s commitment to contributing to its own defense. Burden-sharing is a theme Trump has stressed ever since his presidential campaign.  South Korea is the second stop on Trump’s five country Asian tour. In Japan, he refused to rule out eventual military action against the north and exhorted dictator Kim Jong Un to stop weapons testing, calling the recent launches of missiles over American allies like Japan “a threat to the civilized world and international peace and stability.”  Trump is skipping the customary trip to the demilitarized zone separating north and south — a pilgrimage made by every U.S. president except one since Ronald Reagan as a demonstration of solidarity with the South. A senior administration recently dubbed the border trip as “a bit of a cliche” and several other members of the administration, including Vice President Mike Pence, have visited the DMZ this year. And the White House believes that Trump has already made his support of South Korea crystal clear.  Trump and Moon agree on the need to pressure the North with sanctions and other deterrence measures. But Trump has warned of unleashing “fire and fury,” threatened to “totally destroy” the North, if necessary, and repeatedly insisted that all options are on the table. Moon, meanwhile, favors dialogue as the best strategy for defusing the nuclear tension and vehemently opposes a potential military clash that could cause enormous casualties in South Korea.  Trump backed up his strong words about North Korea by sending a budget request to Capitol Hill on Monday for $4 billion to support “additional efforts to detect, defeat, and defend against any North Korean use of ballistic missiles against the United States, its deployed forces, allies, or partners.”  And as he departed for South Korea, he tweeted that Moon is “a fine gentleman,” adding, “We will figure it all out!”  On a personal level, Trump and Moon have not developed the same close rapport as Trump has with Abe or even China’s Xi Jinping. Part of Moon’s mission during the visit will likely be to strengthen his personal ties with Trump, said Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution.  “Now poor President Moon is playing catch-up ball because everyone acknowledges that he’s not bonding quite as much with Donald Trump as the rest of the region,” said O’Hanlon. He said Moon could face pressure “to deliver a stronger relationship” whereas “in most other parts of the world, people are trying to keep their distance from Donald Trump.”  Trump was spending Tuesday in meetings with Moon, hold a joint press conference and be feted at a state dinner.  Trade also is expected to be a major topic of discussion: Trump has considered pulling out of the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement, also known as KORUS, blaming it for the U.S.-South Korea trade deficit.  ___  Associated Press writers Ken Thomas and Catherine Lucey in Washington contributed to this report.  ___  Follow Colvin on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@colvinj and Lemire at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire.",4.5,1,[4.5]
1466,3113,11,6,2017,2017-11-06,Breitbart,"Bannon: Tight Race in Virginia Shows ‘Trump Issues, Populist-Nationalist Issues, Are Winners’","Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon, formerly chief strategist for President Donald Trump, joined SiriusXM hosts Joel Pollak and Rebecca Mansour to look back at the 2016 presidential campaign and forward at how themes from that campaign continue to resonate in crucial political contests like the Virginia gubernatorial election.  On the one-year anniversary of the Trump campaign’s “Super Sunday” sweep through seven campaign events in a single day, Bannon reflected on the strategy employed to overcome double-digit polling deficits against Hillary Clinton in the battleground states, with only seven weeks to go before the first debate when Bannon left Breitbart News to join the campaign.  “We didn’t have a lot of organization, no money,” he recalled.  “It turned out by Trump going back to this populist-nationalist message, we were actually within the margin of error to two-up on the morning of the debates,” he said. “We knew the debates were going to be very different because she’s a great debater. Trump had never really had one-on-one debates like he was going to have in the presidential run, and so we figured we’d call audibles.”  “When we came to the debates, we knew it was three-and-a-half weeks of a mad sprint, and we were going to build momentum,” he said, putting Super Sunday into the context of that dash for the finish line.  Running that race demonstrated the vast gulf between the Republican establishment and grassroots voters to Bannon.  “On Friday, we get into a huge fight with some of the establishment guys in Wisconsin that said, ‘Hey, you’re going to lose Wisconsin, you’re three points down, five points down. It’s not close. We want to cancel.’ We had this huge fight, and it just turned out we weren’t going to be able to do it, they didn’t want to do it. So we said, ‘Let’s do Minnesota.’ Trump had literally been all over me to do Minnesota from the beginning. We had never really made a stop. We had done one fundraiser but no stops,” he said.  “We went to Minnesota. Joel, you saw how crazy it was there,” he reminisced with Pollak, who was embedded with the Trump campaign as a reporter. “Trump really talked about the Somalia immigration issue. It’s the third rail in Minnesota politics, but it resonated. We lost Minnesota two days later by one point. If we’d have spent more time there, I think we could have won it.”  “It was an incredible day,” he said of Super Sunday. “It was probably the most intense day – although Monday was great – we didn’t get home until five in the morning on Tuesday, Election Day. I’ve got to tell you, that Sunday is a very special day. I think it’s one of the biggest days in American political history.”  Bannon said the key issue of the Trump campaign and presidency is national sovereignty, as reflected in issues ranging from immigration and crime to American involvement in foreign wars. He saw sovereignty as a major issue in the closely watched Virginia gubernatorial race, where Republican Ed Gillespie is running very closely against Democrat Ralph Northam.  “You had a guy like Gillespie who was essentially eight, ten points down four weeks ago, when the Gillespie campaign starts to really embrace the Trump agenda, and part of that is sanctuary cities – deporting guys like these gangs, MS-13 – to really get back and talk about our sovereignty when it deals with illegal immigration and legal immigration. And all of a sudden, Gillespie caught fire because he’s embracing Trumpism.”  He added praise for the Republican candidate for lieutenant governor of Virginia, Jill Holtzman Vogel.  “She is just fantastic. She reminds me quite frankly, RAM, of a Sarah Palin,” he said to Mansour, a former speechwriter for former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. “She’s just a fire-breathing populist. It just gets people worked up. I think you’re seeing once again that this is a massive issue. It’s the central issue of our time, the sovereignty of our country.”  “The hobbits, the working-class people, are not going to let the establishment take it away from them. If it has to be Judge Moore in Alabama, or if it has to be Gillespie – who is, quite frankly, kind of an establishment guy, but he’s got a very anti-establishment lieutenant governor, and he’s really embraced the Trump agenda here in the last four weeks. And the Washington Post is reporting tonight he may be up one or two points. This thing is coming down to a photo finish,” he said.  At the same time Gillespie surged by embracing these issues, Bannon saw Northam stumbling because of strife and ideological confusion in the Democratic Party. “Northam is not a radical. He’s kind of a center-left Democrat. But he can’t even answer the question about sanctuary cities without sounding like an idiot,” he said.  Mansour quoted Bannon’s warning against Republican strife and ideological confusion – that if the coming debate over the DACA program ends with an amnesty deal for illegal aliens, Republicans will “lose the House, especially, and once they lose the House, Nancy Pelosi is going to go for impeachment.”  “I think it’s pretty straightforward,” said Bannon. “If you look in Virginia, you see the grassroots are fired up. They’re coming out now to embrace the Trump agenda as Gillespie has now articulated it. Well, if the grassroots show up, we win. Joel just talked about this fervor that went around these seven stops on Super Sunday in 2016 that really catapulted Trump to the White House. The grassroots are out there. People come to Minnesota literally to an airplane hangar, 20,000 people on a very cold Sunday when pro football is on, to see Trump. Three thousand inside the hangar kind of warm, 17,000 freezing out on the sides. They’ll do that because the grassroots, the hobbits, they want to take their country back. They don’t want to lose their country.”  “But for some reason, the establishment just keeps coming. If you come and force amnesty down people’s throats, you’re going to break the enthusiasm of people. They’re not going to show up. These 23 swing districts are going to turn out to be 50 House seats lost. You’re going to turn it over to Nancy Pelosi, and I don’t care what she says, she’s going to do what Tom Steyer is putting millions of dollars into this campaign to impeach Donald Trump. They’re going to try to impeach him,” Bannon warned.  Pollak proposed that excesses of rhetoric against Gillespie, notably including the infamous campaign ad that purported to show a Gillespie supporter attempting to mow down minority children with a pickup truck, created a huge backlash.  Bannon agreed, noting that sanctuary cities are now a major issue – possibly the defining issue – in the Virginia race but were off the radar screen just a few weeks ago. “This ad was so over the top, it shows some guy, I guess, in a pickup truck with a Confederate battle flag and a Gillespie thing running over people. It was just so over the top, and people were turned off, the people in the center,” he said.  Bannon went on to describe Pollak’s home state of California as a “nullification state” for its sanctuary rules, which effectively neutralize U.S. immigration law.  “You see the extreme measures that people are going to, to really divide the country. I think Virginia has shown that if you get back to the issues of sovereignty, get back to the issues of sanctuary cities, case law, illegal aliens, that you can put a winning coalition together,” he said.  “I think that whether Gillespie wins on Tuesday or not, he certainly closed an eight-and-a-half or nine-point gap in three-and-a-half or four weeks, based upon these issues. I think those Trump issues, those kind of populist-nationalist issues, are winners. I think we can win in 2018 if you just stick with the program and don’t try to force amnesty down people’s throats,” he advised.  Bannon chuckled at Pollak’s account of Democratic National Committee chair Tom Perez’s claim that the noxious anti-Gillespie ad was actually Bannon’s fault because he had endorsed Gillespie and thus brought “fearmongering” into the campaign.  “I’ll take Perez’s compliment,” he said. “There’s only one downside of Gillespie winning on Tuesday, and that’s probably the Democrats will let Perez go at the DNC. I think he’s the gift that keeps on giving.”  Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. Eastern.

A sporting goods store in San Antonio just reported they sold a weapon to Kelley. They obviously had none of the information they needed in the background check to refuse the sale of the gun.  AIR FORCE MISHANDLING OF RECORDS  A day after a gunman massacred parishioners in a small Texas church, the Air Force admitted on Monday that it had failed to enter the man’s domestic violence court-martial into a federal database that could have blocked him from buying the rifle he used to kill 26 people.  The conviction of the gunman, Devin P. Kelley, for domestic assault on his wife and infant stepson — he had cracked the child’s skull — should have stopped Mr. Kelley from legally purchasing the military-style rifle and three other guns he bought in the last four years. But that information was never entered by the Air Force into the federal database for background checks on gun purchasers, the service said.  “The Air Force has launched a review of how the service handled the criminal records of former Airman Devin P. Kelley following his 2012 domestic violence conviction,” the Air Force said in a statement. “Federal law prohibited him from buying or possessing firearms after this conviction.”  The statement said that Heather Wilson, the Air Force secretary, and Gen. David Goldfein, the Air Force chief of staff, had ordered the Air Force inspector general to work with the Pentagon’s inspector general to “conduct a complete review of the Kelley case and relevant policies and procedures.”  The Air Force also said that it was looking into whether other convictions had been improperly left unreported. “The service will also conduct a comprehensive review of Air Force databases to ensure records in other cases have been reported correctly,” the statement said.",4.0,4,"[1.5, 5.0, 4.5, 5.0]"

Owens says that he mentions arthritis but not in his initial conversations with young injured athletes.  “Most young athletes just want to focus on the problem at hand,” he said. “Yesterday in my office, I saw a 17-year-old soccer player. ‘Yes, you tore your A.C.L.’ The tears start to come. It is hard to talk to a 17-year-old about what their knee will be like in 20 years.”  Although Lalli, the former soccer player, said his arthritis diagnosis was a shock, he also said that knowing that it might happen would not have made much difference. He might have a genetic predisposition toward knee arthritis. His father took up soccer in his late 40s and had to have surgery at 50 when he tore the A.C.L. in his left knee.  Then he tore the meniscus — a piece of cartilage that acts as a cushion between the shinbone and the thighbone — in his right knee. He got arthritis later but thought it was because of his age, not his injuries.  Lalli’s arthritis progressed despite his receiving a second A.C.L. reconstruction that was more tailored to the anatomy of his knee. His initial operation had been done by a surgeon who did not position the new ligament in the exact place it had been before.  Lalli had the subsequent operation done by Dr. Freddie Fu, the chairman of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. Fu is a leader in A.C.L. operations that are more anatomically specific, and his procedure stabilized Lalli’s knee. Nonetheless, Lalli has faced years of disabling pain.  Four years ago, when his arthritis got so bad that he gave up playing soccer, Lalli asked for a knee replacement. Fu refused, telling him that artificial knees last only 10 or 15 years in younger and active people and that each knee replacement is more problematic than the one before.",4.666666666666667,3,"[4.5, 5.0, 4.5]"

The researchers did not open the jar, but they could see that Chopin’s heart was “massively enlarged and floppy,” they wrote in the article. It was also covered in a white substance that gave it a “frosted” appearance, leading the researchers to conclude that Chopin had suffered from pericarditis, an inflammation of tissue around the heart that was likely the result of tuberculosis. Previous theories held that he may have died from cystic fibrosis.  The heart has a long and contentious history.

They devote their professional lives to rescuing patients having heart attacks and bringing them back from the brink.  End-of-life care is not typically their focus; neither do they spend much time pondering what some of their patients may experience in the future. “Those who go into cardiology are not necessarily ones who want to deal with death and dying,” Dr. Bristow said.  The very nature of end-stage heart failure makes it all the more difficult to prepare.  “Very few patients understand the trajectory of the disease,” said Dr. Lynne Warner Stevenson, a heart failure specialist at Vanderbilt University. The path has peaks and valleys, but as the patient declines, each peak is a little lower than the one before.  And often doctors do not tell patients what to expect.  “Unfortunately, when you have patients with a chronic illness like heart failure, everyone thinks someone else will talk about it,” Dr. Stevenson said. “Too often, no one takes ownership of the last stage of the journey with the patient.”  Dr. Ellen Hummel of the University of Michigan, one of a small number of doctors specializing in cardiology palliative care, said the typical patient with cancer will usually experience a “fairly predictable” decline.  “They will be less able to take care of themselves,” she said. “They will be more symptomatic and come back to the hospital more frequently. And once this starts, it will probably continue until they die. Most people can see the end coming.”  But patients with end-stage heart failure are more likely to have wild swings, Dr. Hummel said, veering from feeling better to being terribly ill.",4.5,4,"[4.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.0]"

The lottery group members could also sign up to have a friend or family member automatically be notified if they didn’t take their pills so that they could receive social support. They were given access to special social work resources. There was even a staff engagement adviser whose specific duty was providing close monitoring and feedback, and who would remind patients about the importance of adherence.  This was a kitchen-sink approach. It involved direct financial incentives, social support nudges, health care system resources and significant clinical management. It failed.  The time to first hospitalization for a cardiovascular problem or death was the same between the two groups. The time to any hospitalization and the total number of hospitalizations were the same. So were the medical costs. Even medication adherence — the process measure that might influence these outcomes — was no different between the two groups.  The researchers in this trial deserve praise for their frank assessment of their results, as well as for trying to brainstorm ways in which they might achieve success in the future. Getting patients to change their behavior is very hard. In the past, we’ve tried making drugs free to patients to get them to adhere to their medications and improve outcomes. That failed. We’ve tried lotteries (as in the study above) to nudge people to achieve better compliance. That failed.  Maybe financial incentives, and behavioral economics in general, work better in public health than in more direct health care. There have been successes, after all, with respect to weight loss — although these seemed to disappear over time. We’ve also seen promise with respect to smoking cessation, although these come with caveats as well.  Experts caution that the interventions that achieve success are often very intensive. They demand a great deal of attention, and can be quite expensive. Moreover, they are very focused, usually on a single issue or condition.  The problem is that health has so many moving parts. The health care system has even more. Trying to improve any one aspect can make others worse.

1549,3217,11,6,2017,2017-11-06,Vox,Did Rand Paul really get beat up over lawn clippings?,"A new report from GQ goes deeper into the possible tensions between Sen. Rand Paul and the neighbor who attacked him earlier this month — the latest development in a strange saga that began when Rene Boucher tackled the senator on November 3, breaking six of his ribs.  The GQ report doesn’t extinguish the mystery, but provides more details about Boucher’s bubbling frustration over what he saw as Rand Paul’s disregard for landscaping etiquette, including the senator’s alleged habit of mowing too close to Boucher’s lawn and spraying grass clipping over the property line.  The attack on Paul has been shrouded in obscurity for weeks. Boucher’s lawyer released a statement that claimed the source of the matter was a “trivial dispute.” Media reports also painted a picture of a long-simmering property dispute between the two men, possibly over landscaping or yard waste. Other reports speculated on a possible political dispute.  But Paul’s chief strategist denied the men had squabbled and said Paul hadn’t spoken to Boucher in years. “The first ‘conversation'‘with the attacker,” his chief strategist, Doug Stafford, said, “came after Sen. Paul's ribs were broken.”  Paul returned to work a little more than a week after Boucher’s violent assault. On Friday, he said in a video posted on Twitter, said it had been a “rough couple of weeks,” but he’s getting better and working on tax reform.  Here’s what we know about the saga so far.  Paul was mowing his lawn when a neighbor tackled him  Paul had reportedly just finished mowing his lawn on November 3 at his home in Rivergreen, an upscale gated community in Bowling Green when Boucher tackled him from behind, “forcing him to the ground and causing pain,” reported NBC News, which obtained the criminal complaint.  Paul was wearing protective earmuffs to muffle the sound of the mower, two sources told the New York Times, which prevented him from hearing Boucher’s approach. (The senator told US Weekly in a 2015 interview that he loved working in his yard and that “mowing the lawn is very therapeutic for me.”)  NBC News reported that Paul managed to get Boucher off him, after which the two “exchanged words.”  Here is a repost of arrest warrant for Rand Paul incident. This one has redactions. Sincere apologies about missing that last time pic.twitter.com/eDMEOy7hGs — Sam Stein (@samstein) November 6, 2017  Jim Skaggs, a neighbor and one of the developers of the Rivergreen gated community, speculated in GQ that Boucher charged Paul from the street:  From that direction, Paul's yard slopes steeply downward, toward the lake at the rear of his property. Barreling downward about 30 degrees, this imagined path would increase the force of a running tackle, perhaps explaining how a man of Boucher's diminutive stature—an acquaintance of the two men estimates that they both stand five-foot-six and weigh about 140 pounds—could do so much damage.  Boucher, who admitted to tackling Paul in the criminal complaint, was charged with one count of fourth-degree assault, and was released from custody Saturday night on $7,500 bond. He pleaded not guilty during a court appearance on November 9.  State police said Paul had sustained “minor injuries” in the first reports after the incident. But, in the weekend after the attack, Paul’s staffer, Doug Stafford, said in a statement to the Washington Post that the fractured ribs — three of which were partly or completely cracked — had bruised at least one of Paul’s lungs.  “This type of injury is caused by high velocity severe force,” Stafford said. “It is not clear exactly how soon he will return to work, as the pain is considerable as is the difficulty in getting around, including flying.” He described the injuries as those that could lead to serious and long-term health ramifications.  The senator clarified his condition for the first time on November 8. In the tweet, Paul said he broke six ribs (it had originally been reported as five) and suffered from a pleural effusion, which is a buildup of fluid in lining in the outside of the lungs.  I appreciate all of the support from everyone. A medical update: final report indicates six broken ribs & new X-ray shows a pleural effusion — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) November 8, 2017  The investigation continues. Neighbors are talking. But the motive isn’t clear.  Kentucky State Police are investigating the incident in coordination with the FBI, which is standard because Paul is a member of Congress.  The FBI is examining whether the assault on Paul amounts to a federal crime, and prosecutors with the Warren County Commonwealth's Attorney also told the Bowling Green Daily News that they are reviewing the charge, and may update or add to the charges given the apparent seriousness of Paul’s injuries. Boucher has also been ordered to stay at least 200 feet away from Paul.  Fourth-degree assault in Kentucky is a Class A misdemeanor, and Boucher, if convicted, could face up to a year in jail and up to a $500 fine.  No additional charges were added when Boucher entered a “not guilty” plea in court on November 9. According to the Associated Press, Boucher “barely spoke in the courtroom, only saying ‘yes sir’ to a judge.”  Boucher is a retired doctor who practiced as an anesthesiologist and pain specialist; his medical license expired in 2015. According to a Bowling Green Daily News report from 2005, Boucher also invented the Therm-a-Vest, a device that attaches by Velcro and heats up to help with chronic back pain. It was featured on QVC.  The two men who live next door to each other and previously worked together as doctors, may have argued about politics in the past. Jim Bullington, who served on the city commission and was acquainted with both Paul and Boucher, told the Post that the men are political opposites and have had “heated discussions” about health care. One unidentified neighbor told WAVE 3 News that Paul and Boucher had “ongoing” problems — though the report did not elaborate on what those might be.  The Washington Post also said a Facebook page that appeared to belong to Boucher contained some anti-Trump memes.  Boucher’s attorney, in a November 6 statement denied that the attack had anything to do with politics, and instead called it a “regrettable dispute between two neighbors over a matter that most people would regard as trivial”:  Senator Paul and Dr. Boucher have been next door neighbors for 17 years. They are also prominent members of the local medical community and worked together when they were both practicing physicians. The unfortunate occurrence of November 3rd has absolutely nothing to do with either’s politics or political agendas. It was a very regrettable dispute between two neighbors over a matter that most people would regard as trivial. We sincerely hope that Senator Paul is doing well and that these two gentlemen can get back to being neighbors as quickly as possible.  Jonathan Martin of the New York Times has reported that this “trivial” issue might have something to do with some mysterious plant-related problems; sources gave multiple landscape-based reasons that ranged from a new sapling to yard clippings to unraked leaves. NBC News added a wild card: an issue over the property line of a creek behind Paul’s house where his sons used to play.  Two Kentuckians tell me Rand’s neighborhood fracas stemmed from a dispute over some sort of planting or flora issue around the properties — Jonathan Martin (@jmartNYT) November 6, 2017  An unnamed neighbor also told CNN that these lawn-based tensions had long been simmering, though Rob Porter, friend of Paul’s, said the senator told him he hadn’t spoken to Boucher in years. “He is still unsure why he was attacked,” Porter said. “I don’t know if he knows why he was attacked.”  Rand Paul and neighbor have been sparring over yard waste and leaves blown on each other's lawns for years, a neighbor tells @DrewGriffinCNN — Manu Raju (@mkraju) November 6, 2017  Paul added more intrigue by retweeting two stories that cast doubt on the “landscaping dispute” story, both of which originated in conservative news outlets, the Washington Examiner and Breitbart.  Stafford, Paul’s chief strategist, also knocked the idea of a Paul-Boucher dispute. “The first ‘conversation’ with the attacker came after Sen. Paul's ribs were broken,” he said. “This was not a ‘fight,’ it was a blindside, violent attack by a disturbed person. Anyone claiming otherwise is simply uninformed or seeking media attention.”  GQ, in a story published Monday, dug into questions of politics and lawn care. The report, speaking to neighbors and acquaintances in the Bowling Green community, pointed at two men whose personalities clashed, and that played out in a property dispute that left Boucher festering in anger and frustration.  According to GQ, Boucher faced some personal setbacks in recent years, including a divorce in 2008. He had tried to sell his house in the gated community soon after, but he had trouble finding a buyer. Boucher ended up staying put after a deal fell through in 2012.  Boucher, according to neighbors, was a stickler when it came to his property. He paid professionals to tend to his yard, but, his neighbor, Paul did his own landscaping. And it may not have been up to Boucher’s standards. “He had his yard sitting at a beautiful two-and-a-half, three inches thick, where Rand cuts it to the nub,” Bill Goodwin, a Bowling Green resident who knows both men, told GQ.  Paul, hobbyist mower that he is, also may not have been the most attentive at the post-yard work cleanup. Boucher fretted over Paul’s grass clippings that ended up in his yard, confronting the senator and complaining to the neighborhood association. “I've asked him and I've asked him and I've asked him,” Goodwin remembers Boucher complaining about the senator’s lawn etiquette. “How long can you sit there taking someone plucking a hair out of your nose?”  Still, even if Boucher was scrupulous about lawn care, stray grass clippings rarely lead to broken ribs. And neighbors in the upscale neighborhood aren’t thrilled about how the incident brought scrutiny on their neighborhood. One person, talking to GQ, called both the attacker and the victim “two little shits.”  Boucher will return to court November 30 for a pretrial hearing.  Paul could have pain for “weeks or months” — but he’s returned to the Senate  Paul, left bloodied and bruised after the attack, faces a potentially prolonged recovery. “This type of injury is also accompanied by severe pain that can last weeks to months,” Stafford said.  But last Monday, Paul confirmed on Twitter that he was still in a “good deal of pain,” but said he’s heading back to Washington. “I will be returning to work in the Senate today,” he wrote, “ready to fight for liberty and help move forward with tax cuts in the coming days and weeks.  Kelley and I want to thank everyone once again for your thoughts and prayers for my recovery. While I’m still in a good deal of pain, I will be returning to work in the Senate today, ready to fight for liberty and help move forward with tax cuts in the coming days and weeks. — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) November 13, 2017  Even President Donald Trump offered his well wishes.  Great to see @RandPaul looking well and back on the Senate floor. He will help us with TAX CUTS and REFORM! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 14, 2017  This is good news for Republicans. A prolonged absence by Paul could have complicated things for the party, which has been relying on their slim majority in the upper chamber to push through their legislative agenda. The GOP is following an aggressive timeline to pass tax reform by the end of the year. Paul’s vote may be necessary to pass the Senate’s version of the tax bill without Democratic votes (and integral to pretty much everything else on the Republican to-do list).  Of course, Paul is not always a reliable vote for the GOP. He was the sole Republican senator who voted against the Senate budget resolution that changed the rules for passing tax legislation because he wanted deeper cuts. He might again be a spoiler on the Senate’s tax bill. So far he has signaled his support — though he is among the senators supporting a repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate in the Senate plan.  The attack on Paul also adds to questions over the security of lawmakers, as the Wall Street Journal points out. In June, a gunman opened fire at a GOP congressional baseball practice, injuring four people, including severely wounding House Majority Whip Steve Scalise. Paul, who was at the practice that day, escaped unharmed.",4.5,1,[4.5]
1468,3116,11,6,2017,2017-11-06,Fox News,Menendez corruption and bribery case: What to know,"Sen. Bob Menendez will not face a new bribery and corruption trial after all, federal prosecutors said last month.  The Department of Justice had announced earlier this year that it intended to retry the New Jersey Democrat after a federal judge declared a mistrial in the case in November, but ultimately walked away from the pursuit.  Menendez was accused of accepting a plethora of donations and gifts from a wealthy friend in exchange for political influence. Both Menendez and the doctor, Salomon Melgen, maintained their innocence.  “From the very beginning, I never wavered in my innocence and my belief that justice would prevail. I am grateful that the Department of Justice has taken the time to reevaluate its case and come to the appropriate conclusion,” Menendez said on social media following the announcement.  Menendez is up for re-election this year. He was selected to replace former Gov. Jon Corzine, D-N.J., in the Senate in 2005. He rejoined the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee as its ranking member on Feb. 6, after stepping down from the post when he was indicted in 2015.  Read on for a look at what Menendez was accused of and what happened in the trial.  What was Menendez accused of?  Menendez, 64, accepted an abundance of campaign donations, gifts and vacations from Salomon Melgen, a Florida ophthalmologist, prosecutors alleged when Menendez faced trial in 2017. In return, prosecutors claimed, he used his position to lobby on behalf of Melgen’s business interests.  Melgen allegedly directed more than $750,000 in campaign contributions to entities that supported Menendez, according to the indictment, which prosecutors said were inducements to get Menendez to use his influence on Melgen's behalf. Prosecutors have also accused Menendez of trying to hide the gifts.  Melgen paid for Menendez and his girlfriend to stay for three nights at a Parisian hotel where rooms typically cost about $1,500 per night and allowed the senator the use of his private jet, according to prosecutors.  Federal prosecutors said that Menendez “sold his office for a lifestyle that he couldn’t afford.”  The indictment also alleged that Menendez pressured State Department officials to give visas to three young women described as Melgen's girlfriends.  What was the senator’s defense?  Both Menendez and Melgen pleaded not guilty – and Menendez has vehemently denied the accusations against him.  Throughout the original trial, defense attorneys sought to prove that Menendez and Melgen have been friends since before the former became a senator, and the trips were nothing more than friends traveling together.  Is there anything else to know about Salomon Melgen?  Melgen, 63, was convicted of 67 counts of health care fraud in April 2017 in what the Palm Beach Post called one of the biggest Medicare fraud cases in the U.S.  Melgen was sentenced to 17 years in prison on Feb. 22 for Medicare fraud, as he persuaded patients to undergo treatments they did not necessarily need.  Aside from Menendez, Melgen has given significant amounts of money to a variety of Democratic lawmakers, according to public records.  How did the trial end?  After the jury again informed the judge they could not reach a decision, U.S. District Court Judge William H. Walls declared a mistrial, saying he found “no alternative.”  The mistrial was declared on Nov. 16.  The Associated Press contributed to this report.",4.5,1,[4.5]
1397,3006,11,5,2017,2017-11-05,Fox News,"Trump, Japan's Abe meet before start of high-stakes diplomacy","President Donald Trump's five-nation Asia trip got off to a low-key start Sunday as he enjoyed a round of golf with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.  The two leaders hit the links not long after a lunch of American-beef hamburgers, not long after Trump's arrival from Hawaii.  But the display of friendship from Abe will soon give way to high-stakes diplomacy. Still, the two men have struck up an easy rapport.  Their formal talks are set to begin Monday in Tokyo. Abe will be looking for a united front against North Korea and reassurances that the U.S. will stand by its treaty obligations to defend Japan if falls under attack.  Eager to forge a bond with Tokyo's crucial ally, Abe was one of the first world leaders to court President-elect Trump. He was the first to call Trump after the election, and rushed to New York days later to meet the president-elect and present him with a pricey, gold Honma golf driver.  The two men also met on the sidelines of an international summit in Italy this spring and White House officials said Trump has spoken with Abe by phone more than any world leader, aside from British Prime Minister Theresa May.  That bond was clear Sunday, as Trump and Abe exchanged glowing tweets about their game. Trump dubbed Abe and pro golfer Hideki Matsuyama -- who accompanied the two leaders -- as ""wonderful people,"" while Abe called it a ""round of golf with a marvelous friend.""  From the time Marine One landed on the Kasumigaseki Country Club's driving range, Abe rolled out little touches to make Trump feel welcome. He presented a hat that had a version of Trump's campaign theme, this time reading ""Donald and Shinzo: Make Alliance Even Greater.""  The two passed up the region's famed Kobe beef in favor of the American version, which is favored by Trump, a famed picky eater.  When Trump hosted Abe in Palm Beach, Fla., earlier this year, they played at one of Trump's golf courses. For that outing, Trump brought along pro golfer Ernie Els, so this time Abe matched him by bringing along Matsuyama, whom Trump described on the plane ride to Asia as ""probably the greatest player in the history of Japan.""  Abe was behind the wheel of a golf cart as the two men were spotted moving from hole to hole, Trump in the passenger seat smiling and waving at those they passed.    ""From the point of view of Abe administration, the personal chemistry that exists between the two leaders is seen as an asset,"" said Mireya Sollis, chair in Japan Studies for the Brookings Center for East Asia Policy Studies.  She said that the Japanese believe it is already ""seeing it pay off,"" including when Trump agreed to meet with the families of Japanese citizens kidnapped by the North Korean regime, an important issue for Tokyo.  Ever since Saudi Arabia delivered a lavish welcome on Trump's first international trip, leaders have tried to outdo themselves to impress the president, who has proven susceptible to flattery.  Before the game, Trump delivered a speech in which he hailed Japan as a ""crucial ally"" and warned adversaries not to test America's resolve.  ""Japan is a treasured partner and crucial ally of the United States and today we thank them for welcoming us and for decades of wonderful friendship between our two nations,"" Trump told American service members at Yokota Air Base on the outskirts of Tokyo.  Though Trump did not mention North Korea by name during the speech, the spectre of its weapons program will loom large throughout Trump's five-nation Asia trip. The president warned of the consequences of crossing what he called the ""most fearsome fighting force in the history of our world.""  ""Together with our allies, America's warriors are prepared to defend our nation using the full range of our unmatched capabilities. No one -- no dictator, no regime and no nation -- should underestimate, ever, American resolve,"" he told the troops.  And while there is worry in the region about Trump's unpredictable response to the threat posed by Kim Jong Un, Trump made clear he did not intend to tone down his bellicose rhetoric -- which included dubbing Kim Jong Un as ""Little Rocket Man"" -- even while in an Asian capital within reach of the North Korea dictator's missiles.  ""There's been 25 years of total weakness, so we are taking a very much different approach"" in dealing with the renegade regime in Pyongyang, he said, speaking to reporters on Air Force One.  Trump also said it is ""expected"" that he'll meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of an upcoming summit in Vietnam.  The easy rapport with Japan could be strained if Trump takes an aggressive approach on trade or the two men disagree on the need for a diplomatic approach to the threat looming in Pyongyang.  During his campaign, Trump suggested Japan should acquire its own nuclear weapons to defend itself, hinted the U.S. might not come to the nation's defense, and accused Japan of ""killing us"" on trade. He has dropped that antagonist language almost entirely since the election, but tensions remain.  Japan was a chief proponent of the Trans Pacific Partnership, a trade deal Trump pulled out of.  Scott Seaman, a director for Asia of the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultant organization, noted: ""everything is fine with Trump until you tell him no. So far, Abe hasn't told him no.""

1417,3037,11,5,2017,2017-11-05,Associated Press News,Brazile stirs Dem party strife as bellwether gov race nears," In this Monday, March 6, 2017, file photo, Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chairman Tom Perez speaks at a protest in Washington. The Democratic National Committee chairman, Perez, is questioning Donna Brazile's claim, his predecessor, that she could have initiated efforts to replace Hillary Clinton as the party's presidential nominee with then-Vice President Joe Biden. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats are struggling to put the bitter 2016 election behind them as the party’s current chairman and his predecessor bicker over Hillary Clinton’s failed campaign, further exposing deep divisions two days before the closely watched Virginia governor’s race that could foretell Democratic prospects in 2018 and beyond.  The dueling across Sunday news shows was triggered by the disclosure that Donna Brazile, the interim Democratic leader during the final months of the campaign, considered an effort to replace Clinton as the presidential nominee because of health concerns.  “The charge that Hillary Clinton was somehow incapacitated is quite frankly ludicrous,” said Tom Perez, who took over as Democratic National Committee chairman after Donald Trump won the election.  Brazile, who claimed “tremendous pressure” to devise a backup ticket led by then-Vice President Joe Biden after Clinton fainted at an event, pushed back: “Go to hell. I’m going to tell my story.”  The dispute was spurred by revelations by Brazile in a memoir being released Tuesday and reported on by The Washington Post. It reflected simmering tensions between establishment and insurgent wings that will set the party’s future course on issues from its platform to the primary schedule and use of superdelegates — party leaders and elected officials who get a say in the nomination — in the 2020 presidential race.  “One of the things, as we go forward, is to give more power to the grass roots in all this,” said House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California, urging Democrats not to “relitigate elections.”  Brazile writes that she considered initiating Clinton’s removal after the candidate collapsed while leaving a 9/11 memorial service in New York City, and Brazile contemplated a dozen combinations to replace Clinton and her running mate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine. Brazile wrote that she settled on Biden and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker as having the best chance of defeating Republican Trump.  Brazile says the larger issue was that Clinton campaign was “anemic” and had taken on “the odor of failure.”  But, she says, “I thought of Hillary, and all the women in the country who were so proud of and excited about her. I could not do this to them.”  The revelations elicited a strong weekend rebuttal from Clinton’s former campaign staffers. An open letter signed by more than 100 people said they “do not recognize the campaign” that Brazile “portrays in the book.”  The Clinton staffers responded they were “shocked to learn” that Brazile would consider overturning the will of Democratic voters. “It is particularly troubling and puzzling that she would seemingly buy into false Russian-fueled propaganda, spread by both the Russians and our opponent, about our candidate’s health.”  On Sunday, Perez echoed the complaints, saying Brazile never had authority under DNC rules to replace the ticket because Clinton was not incapacitated.  Under party rules, a DNC head can call a special meeting to fill a “vacancy” on the national ticket in the event of disability in coordination with Democratic leaders of Congress and Democratic governors, but only the full DNC can fill the vacancy. At the time, Clinton had revealed she was suffering from pneumonia.  “I don’t know what Donna Brazile fell for,” Perez said. “Hillary Clinton was anything but incapacitated. She was tireless.”  “I think people who read that charge, which is just without merit, are going to perhaps start wondering about other claims in the book,” he added.  The book’s revelations come just before Tuesday’s Virginia’s governor race, where Republicans have not won a significant statewide election since 2009. The Democratic candidate, Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, is casting the race to voters as a way to repudiate the policies of Trump against Ed Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman. But Northam has received lukewarm support within his own party from the progressive group Democracy for America.  A win for Democrats could help defuse Brazile’s book and give the party important momentum. A loss would be a big blow to other Democrats plotting a similar anti-Trump strategy in the 2018 midterm congressional races and likely spur louder calls for radical changes in the DNC heading into 2020. Also Tuesday is a New Jersey governor’s race, where Democrat Phil Murphy holds a solid lead over Republican Lt. Gov Kim Guadagno to succeed departing Gov. Chris Christie, also a Republican.  In an excerpt published earlier by Politico, Brazile had written that she believed a joint fundraising agreement signed between Clinton and the DNC “looked unethical” and that she felt Clinton had too much influence on the party during a competitive Democratic primary with rival Bernie Sanders.  Over the weekend, Perez issued a statement saying he and the DNC leadership were committed to ensuring that the nomination process in 2020 will be “unquestionably fair and transparent.”  Among the reforms he said he developed after listening to Democrats across the party spectrum was ensuring that “no candidate participating in our presidential nominating process gains any unfair advantage — real or perceived — during our primary season.” He also said the debate schedule would be decided in advance rather than negotiated after all candidates had entered the race.  Perez pledged to ensure that all joint fundraising agreements would be transparent, including the new Democratic Grassroots Victory Fund agreements developed with the 50 state parties.  Still in play are recommendations of a Unity Reform Commission, created in a concession to supporters of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders to re-examine the nominating process, including the role of superdelegates and primary scheduling.  “We have to make sure that everybody feels at the end of the process that everyone got a fair shake,” Perez said.

1420,3040,11,5,2017,2017-11-05,Associated Press News,Saudi arrests of princes consolidates another’s power grab," In this Sunday, March 7, 2010 file photo, Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal al-Saud attends the speech of King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz al-Saud of Saudi Arabia, at the Saudi Shura ""consultative"" council in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia has arrested dozens of princes and former government ministers, including a well-known billionaire with extensive holdings in Western companies, as part of a sweeping anti-corruption probe, further cementing King Salman and his crown prince son's control of the kingdom. A high-level employee at Prince Alwaleed bin Talal's Kingdom Holding Company told The Associated Press that the royal was among those detained overnight Saturday, Nov. 4, 2017. (AP Photo/Hassan Ammar, File)  RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Saudi Arabia’s heir to the throne is overseeing an unprecedented wave of arrests of dozens of the country’s most powerful princes, military officers, influential businessmen and government ministers — some potential rivals or critics of the crown prince now consolidating his power.  Among those taken into custody overnight Saturday in the purported anti-corruption sweep were billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, one of the world’s richest men with extensive holdings in Western companies, as well as two of the late King Abdullah’s sons.  The arrest of senior princes upends a longstanding tradition among the ruling Al Saud family to keep their disagreements private in an effort to show strength and unity in the face of Saudi Arabia’s many tribes and factions. It also sends a message that the 32-year-old crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has the full backing of his father, King Salman, to carry out sweeping anti-corruption reforms targeting senior royals and their business associates, who have long been seen as operating above the law.  Reports suggested those detained were being held at the Ritz Carlton in Riyadh, which only days earlier hosted a major investment conference that the crown prince attended with global business titans. A Saudi official told The Associated Press that other five-star hotels across the capital were also being used to hold some of those arrested.  The Ritz Carlton had no availability for bookings until Dec. 1, 2017 — a possible sign that an investigation of this scale could take weeks. Marriott International said in a statement that it is currently evaluating the situation at the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh, but declined to comment further, citing privacy concerns.  A Saudi government official with close ties to security forces said 11 princes and 38 others were being questioned. The official spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.  The surprise arrests were immediately hailed by pro-government media outlets as the clearest sign yet that Prince Mohammed is keeping his promise to reform the country, wean its economy from its dependence on oil and liberalize some aspects of the ultraconservative society.  The kingdom’s top council of clerics issued a public statement overnight saying it is an Islamic duty to fight corruption — essentially giving religious backing to the high-level arrests.  It’s unclear if the U.S. had any advance word of the arrests. President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and White House adviser Jared Kushner and others made an unannounced trip recently to Riyadh. Earlier on Saturday, Trump said he spoke to King Salman, though the White House readout of that call did not include any reference to the impending arrests.  The Saudi government says the arrests are part of a wider effort to increase transparency, accountability and good governance — key reforms needed to attract greater international investments and appease a Saudi public that has for decades complained of rampant government corruption and misuse of public funds by top officials. Surprise moves reshaping the kingdom, however, are likely to worry investors.  Among those reportedly taken into custody were two sons of the late King Abdullah: Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, who Saturday evening was ousted from his post as head of the prestigious National Guard tasked with protecting the Al Saud family, and Prince Turki bin Abdullah, who was once governor of Riyadh.  Prince Miteb was once considered a contender for the throne, though he has not been thought of recently as a challenger to Prince Mohammed.  Saudi Twitter accounts released several other names of those arrested, including Alwalid al-Ibrahim, a Saudi businessman with ties to the royal family who runs the Arabic satellite group MBC; Amr al-Dabbagh, the former head of the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority; Ibrahim Assaf, a former finance minister, and Bakr Binladin, head of the Saudi Binladin Group, a major business conglomerate.  Analysts have suggested the arrest of once-untouchable members of the royal family is a clear sign that the crown prince is sidelining potential rivals for the throne.  Meanwhile, the Saudi-owned, Dubai-based satellite news channel Al-Arabiya reported that a helicopter crash Sunday in the kingdom’s south killed Prince Mansour bin Murquin and seven others. Prince Mansour was the son of Prince Muqrin bin Abdulaziz, a former intelligence director and a one-time crown prince of the kingdom. Authorities gave no cause for the crash.  The young Crown Prince Mohammed has risen from near obscurity to become Saudi Arabia’s most talked about and powerful prince in less than three years since his father ascended to the throne. The prince’s swift rise to power has unnerved more experienced, elder members of the royal family, which has long ruled by consensus, though ultimate decision-making remains with the monarch.  The moves in Saudi Arabia mirror those in China, where President Xi Jinping has used corruption charges “as a battering ram to consolidate his own power and authority,” said John Hannah, the senior counselor at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, an Iran-skeptic think tank in Washington whose hawkish geopolitical views often coincide with the kingdom’s.  Hannah said Prince Mohammed has “latched onto corruption as a way to consolidate his power and remake the regime in his image,” purging those who might be resistant.  It is not clear what Prince Alwaleed or the others were being investigated for.  Without naming those arrested, the Attorney General’s office said “the suspects are being granted the same rights and treatment as any other Saudi citizen.” The statement did not disclose specific details about the investigation, but stressed that no assets have yet been frozen and that individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty.  A high-level employee at Prince Alwaleed bin Talal’s Kingdom Holding Co. told the AP that the royal was among those detained. The senior employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to fear of repercussions, said security bodies informed him of the arrest.  Prince Alwaleed’s many investments include Twitter, Apple, Citigroup, and the Four Seasons hotel chain. He is also an investor in ride-sharing services Lyft and Careem. He was once a significant shareholder in Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation, but sold much of those shares in 2015.  The prince, pictured sometimes on his 85-meter (278-foot) super-yacht in the Mediterranean, is among the most outspoken Saudi royals and a longtime advocate of women’s rights. He is also majority owner of the popular Rotana Group of Arabic channels.  After word of his arrest, his company’s stock dropped 7.6 percent in trading Sunday on the Saudi stock exchange.  An earlier crackdown this year on perceived critics of the crown prince included clerics and lesser-known princes.  In July, Prince Mohammed’s most formidable challenger to the throne, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, was plucked from the line of succession and ousted from his post as interior minister, overseeing internal security. This laid the groundwork for the king’s son to claim the mantle of crown prince.  Prince Mohammed’s gambles have not always succeeded . A yearslong war he has overseen as defense minister against Iranian-allied rebels in Yemen has not made the kingdom safer.  As news was unfolding about the anti-corruption probe, Saudi Arabia said late Saturday it had intercepted a ballistic missile fired from Yemen at Riyadh International Airport, on the outskirts of the capital.  “The dismissals and detentions suggest that Prince Mohammed rather than forging alliances is extending his iron grip to the ruling family, the military, and the national guard to counter what appears to be more widespread opposition within the family as well as the military to his reforms and the Yemen war,” James M. Dorsey, a Gulf specialist and senior fellow at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, said in an analysis of the shake-up.  ___  Associated Press writer Abdullah al-Shihri reported this story in Riyadh and AP writer Aya Batrawy reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

1421,3041,11,5,2017,2017-11-05,Fox News,Newt Gingrich: Why Trump's tax plan has me feeling so optimistic,"The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that Republicans introduced Thursday represents a tremendous opportunity for the Congress and the President to take the U.S. economy to a new level of prosperity and improve the lives of hundreds of millions of Americans.  As I wrote earlier this week, the Trump effect has already brought gross domestic product (GDP) growth up to 3 percent for two straight quarters – which so-called experts insisted for months was nearly impossible.  At the same time, Pew Research Center reported on Tuesday that 82 percent of Americans now say they have either achieved their definition of the American Dream or are on their way to achieving it. The Washington Examiner points out that this is a stark contrast to 2014, when a similar CNN project found that 60 percent of Americans thought the American Dream was unattainable.  The tax relief and job creating provisions included in the Republican plan will continue to grow the GDP and help even more Americans realize their dreams.  If passed by Congress and signed into law by President Trump, Americans will get to keep more of their hard-earned money. The Republican bill roughly doubles the standard deduction, increasing it from $12,000 to $24,000 for families and from $6,350 to $12,000 for individuals. This means families who earn the median household income ($59,000 a year) will only pay taxes on $35,000 of their income, which translates into a $1,182 tax cut for these families.  Further, the bill includes a Family Credit, which expands tax credits for families with children, as well as those caring for older relatives. The tax cut bill increases the current Child Tax Credit from $1,000 to $1,600 and provides a $300 credit for elderly parents and adult-dependents. Keep in mind, these are not deductions, these are dollar-for-dollar tax credits.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also drastically simplifies our tax system, which will enable Americans to save even more money. The bill gets rid of many deductions and loopholes that shift much of the tax burden onto the American middle class. This streamlining will allow most Americans to file their taxes on a form the size of a postcard, and the savings families will experience from this simplification will be like an additional income tax relief.  Many Americans will also see their wages and job opportunities increase due to the enormous reductions in business taxes included in the bill.  The bill sets a 25 percent maximum tax rate for small businesses and other pass-through corporations. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, these businesses represent 99.7 percent of U.S. employers – and employ nearly half of the private sector workforce. Giving these small business owners the ability to keep more of the money their businesses earn will result in an explosion of investment and job creation. This will then lead to wage increases, as companies will once again have to compete for job candidates.  Additionally, the tax rate for corporations will be reduced from 35 percent down to 20 percent. This cut – the largest corporate tax cut in our nation’s history – will make America competitive with the rest of the developed world, making our country more attractive to large manufacturers and other multinational businesses. This is perfectly in line with President Trump’s America first principle on which he campaigned last year and will lead to more products around the world being labeled “Made in America.”  Finally, the GOP bill also reforms our outdated multinational tax system so that businesses will once again be encouraged to bring foreign earnings back to the United States, instead of investing them and creating jobs overseas.  The passage of this bill will be a defining moment for our country. It will cut through all the noise of Washington and show Americans they were right to elect Republicans to lead in the White House and Congress.  Over the next few weeks, the Democrats and the left-wing media will undoubtedly try to oppose this bill. They will come up with all sorts of reasons why they don’t support the bill, but what they are truly arguing against is lower taxes, more jobs, higher wages, and a simpler, fairer system. The American people will see that once again, the Left is trying to stand in the way of our country’s working class, who are finally starting to see their American dreams become a reality.

Bannon.  In a speech to the members of The Remembrance Project, an organization made up of the families of American victims who have been murdered at the hands of illegal aliens, Bannon exposed the latest efforts by GOP Senators and Congressmen to sell amnesty for illegal aliens to the American people while making false promises in exchange.  “This is a struggle, this is every day,” Bannon said of pushing back against an amnesty for illegal aliens. “The first struggle, as we often have, is the Republican establishment. Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan. By the way, there are no more games. There’s no more slipping this stuff in the middle of the night. By the way … I must have missed … I must have missed where they said they were going to slip in building a wall into an appropriations bill. Where’s our wall? Where’s that wall?”  “You’re going to have a fight in the next 30 days, okay. In the next 40 days, next two months okay,” Bannon said. “You’re going to have it in the House and you’re going to have it in the Senate. And they’re going to try to hide the football and they’re going to try to tell you that they’ve got enhanced border security and they’ve got 10 times more ICE agents and they’re going to have a … [an amnesty] is never going to happen again. Right, that this is never going to happen again. They’re lying. And here’s the important thing, you know they’re lying. You’re on to their game now.”  For the last few months, GOP establishment politicians have attempted to sell an amnesty for illegal alien recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which would set them on track to gain U.S. citizenship.  As Breitbart News reported, if Republicans and Democrats signed off on an amnesty plan for DACA illegal aliens, it could trigger a chain migration to the U.S. where 9.9 million to 19 million foreign nationals enter the country over the next several decades.  Since DACA’s inception, more than 2,100 DACA recipients saw their protected status revoked for being involved in gang activity or suspected/convicted of a felony. Due to a loophole in the DACA program, more than 39,000 illegal aliens have been able to obtain Green Cards and more than 1,000 naturalized.  John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Their light field technology can bring an extraordinary amount of depth and detail to a virtual reality image. The biggest VR camera we use regularly at The Times is about the size of a basketball. Lytro’s camera is the size of a sumo wrestler. It gathers about 475 times more visual information than we do for a standard VR piece. Lytro’s system also features Six Degrees of Freedom (6DoF), which enables the viewer in aheadset to move around within the piece. If you are standing in front of a person, you can close the distance to them or step farther away. If you are watching an animation, you can crouch down or swivel to the side to see what the image looks like from a different angle. This freedom of movement increases the sense that you are right there with Rachel. It’s what we call “presence” — the magic of VR.  During this process, we were also working closely with Brendan Baker, a sound designer whom I knew from his work on the podcast “Love + Radio,” which is known for its innovative use of sound in storytelling. I thought of him as the mad scientist of the podcast world, which was exactly what we needed to create a sound design that could accurately represent the sounds that Rachel was hearing when she first turned on her cochlear implant. The production company Q Department came in on the back end to spatialize the sound design so the sound would adjust as you moved your head in the headset.  When Rachel got that playlist from her friends, she was trying to do something she hadn’t done before: hear music. In working on this piece, we were trying to do some things we hadn’t done before. We were trying to create a VR piece that was animated, that incorporated new 6DoF technologies and that told Rachel’s story with the depth and sensitivity it deserved.

You’ll be happy to hear that several different sites have answered the call and can summarize these streaming catalogs at a glance. Click here for easy-to-follow guides to streaming content.  Adjust TV volume  Q: The dialogue on my TV is awful. I can hardly hear people, but the sounds are loud. How can I fix this?  A: When you bring a new TV into your home, it arrives with a lot of arbitrary settings: tint, color, contrast and so on. The volume controls are nearly as important as the picture, because they can dramatically affect the sound of the dialogue, ambient noise and music. There are many ways to fix this problem, but if you’re not accustomed to working with speakers and acoustics, you’ll need a little guidance. Click here to learn about a hidden volume setting.  Comparing smart temperature controls  Q: I was thinking about getting a smart thermostat to save money on heating bills. Is the Nest or Ecobee the better choice?

News of the settlement deal, reported last week by the Louisville Courier-Journal, prompted Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin to hold a news conference Saturday, at which he called upon “every individual” in the Statehouse linked to a sexual harassment settlement to resign.  Bevin mentioned no names, but said the scandal involved “multiple events and multiple people.”  “I am calling ... for the immediate resignation of every individual who has settled a sexual harassment case who is party to trying to hide this type of behavior,” Bevin said.  ""I am calling ... for the immediate resignation of every individual who has settled a sexual harassment case who is party to trying to hide this type of behavior."" — Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin  The Republican stressed that the allegations have not been denied and that they “were not isolated to a single person or a single event but involve multiple events and multiple people.”  The Courier-Journal initially reported that House Speaker Jeff Hoover, a Republican, had settled a sexual harassment claim outside of court with one of his staffers.  Then on Saturday, the newspaper reported that the settlement involved three other lawmakers as well as Hoover’s chief of staff.  The newspaper identified the others as Reps. Jim DeCesare of Rockfield, Brian Linder of Dry Ridge and Michael Meredith of Brownsville, all Republicans, and chief of staff Ginger Wills, citing sources with knowledge of the deal.  As Bevin was leaving the news conference, a reporter asked if the governor wanted Hoover to resign.  “You heard me,” Bevin said.  Hoover said Saturday that he has no plans to resign, and he accused the governor of ""grandstanding,"" the Courier-Journal reported.  Hoover has refused to confirm or deny the settlement. But in a private meeting with House Republicans, Hoover said he was ""legally"" prohibited from talking about it and said he had asked for forgiveness from his family, according to Republican state Rep. Wesley Morgan who attended the meeting.  Saturday, House GOP leaders issued a news release saying they planned to hire a private law firm to investigate the allegations. The leaders said they had not consulted Hoover about the decision, but had told him about it. The release said the investigators would have the power to subpoena witnesses.

1434,3054,11,5,2017,2017-11-05,Breitbart,"John Kelly-Appointed DHS Official Urges: Extend Work Permits for 300,000 Migrants","The federal government should provide extended protective status to 300,000 non-citizens living in the United States, says a top John Kelly-appointee at President Donald Trump’s Department of Homeland Security.  The proposed temporary amnesty comes from James (Jim) D. Nealon, the assistant secretary for International Affairs in DHS’s Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans, just as top officials debate whether to end the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designations for nationals from four Central American countries, many of whom have benefitted from status renewals for close to two decades.  They “work legally in great numbers,” are “liv[ing] the American dream,” and “have many thousands of American citizen children,” “it makes no sense to send [citizens of Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador] back to their country of origin,” Nealon, a former U.S. ambassador to Honduras appointed in 2014 by then-President Barack Obama, argues in an October 31, 2017, memorandum obtained by Breitbart News.  In the memo, Nealon urges acting DHS Secretary Elaine Duke to extend these three countries’ TPS designations for 18 months, speaking on behalf of foreigners in an administration that is supposedly aiming to “Buy American, Hire American”.  “While TPS was always meant to be temporary,” Nealon says, these non-citizens “have jobs” in America and “have a very high workforce participation rate, much higher than the national average.”  As of October 2017, 6.5 million Americans are unemployed.  Nealon was appointed by former DHS Secretary and now-White House Chief of Staff General John Kelly, having served within the U.S. Southern Command as civilian deputy to then-Commander Kelly and later as then-President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Honduras.  James D. Nealon (left) and White House Chief of Staff General John Kelly (Photo credit: ORLANDO SIERRA/Staff/Associated Press, NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images)  During his stint as DHS Secretary, Kelly granted a short-term TPS extension to Haiti despite the original reason for its designation, a 2010 earthquake, having long passed. (More than 58,000 Haitians already illegally present in the U.S. registered for TPS that year). Kelly also encouraged Congress to come up with a legislative fix to help those living in America with TPS.  Founded in 1990, the little-known TPS program was designed to grant temporary amnesty to foreigners whose home countries faced an unexpected event. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) gives DHS the authority to decide which countries should receive this status so long as the countries meet certain statutory requirements: an armed conflict or civil war; an environmental disaster (such as an earthquake or hurricane), or an epidemic; or “other extraordinary and temporary conditions” — that would make it unsafe for them to return home. (Living in America or having an American job do not count.)  James D. Nealon (Photo Credit: ORLANDO SIERRA/AFP/Getty Images)  The acting secretary must make her decisions based on what’s in the statute, and while the statute does say the secretary has limited discretion to re-designate/extend relief based on what the country in question’s post-crisis conditions are like, Nealon does not cite the law or mention whether or not it is actually safe to return.  Nealon instead cites foreign-relations considerations in his emotional appeal.  For example, the influx of returnees for Nealon would put “a huge burden on employment” in home countries, something, he says, would be akin to “working against ourselves.”  “The United States is currently investing approximately 700 million dollars annually in Central America, aimed at mitigating the push factors of migration,” he writes in the memo:  The point of this assistance is to reduce the very high levels of violence, improve governance and weak institutions like the police and courts, and create economic opportunities such that Central Americans see their futures at home and not in the United States. Much of this assistance is aimed, directly or indirectly, at improving the ability of these countries to re-integrate their citizens.  The U.S.’s efforts to change these, what Nealon calls, “dynamics on the ground” “have been very positive,” but he warns “there is still a very long way to go.”  “[T]heir economies are still not capable of creating sufficient job and opportunities for their young and growing populations.

A second Royal Order was issued to relieve Minister of Economy and Planning, Adel al-Faqieh, from his duties, and the appointment of Mohammed Al Tuwaijri as Minister of Economy and Planning.  According to a Royal Decree issued by King Salman on Saturday the anti-corruption committee is chaired by the Crown Prince with the membership of: Chairman of the Monitoring and Investigation Commission, Chairman of the National Anti-Corruption Authority, Chief of the General Audit Bureau, Attorney General and Head of State Security.  As Saudi analysts were quick to point out, the purge by the Saudi King means that King Abdallah’s last remnants (Riyad firmer gov. & head of Nat. Guard); media moguls; SAGIA & financial policy officials have been purged.  As Bloomberg notes, changing the head of the National Guard, an institution that’s been controlled by the clan of the late King Abdullah, “is not like changing the minister of oil,” said Kamran Bokhari, a senior analyst with Geopolitical Futures and a senior fellow with the Center for Global Policy. “I wouldn’t be surprised if this leads to greater fissures within the royal family.”  Arabiya adds that King Salman also issued sacking and replacement orders for Admiral Abdullah bin Sultan bin Mohammed Al-Sultan, the Commander of the Naval Forces, is to be terminated and be retired; his replacement is Vice Admiral Fahd bin Abdullah Al-Ghifaili, to be promoted to the rank of admiral and be appointed as Commander of the Naval Forces.  Additionally, Minister of Economy and Planning Adel al-Faqieh was replaced by Mohammed al-Tuwaijri, SPA said, quoting a royal decree.

1458,3105,11,5,2017,2017-11-05,Breitbart,"SNL’s Alec Baldwin Victim-Blames Rose McGowan, Lashes Out at Alleged Rape Victim Asia Argento","Late last week, in an apparent attempt to inoculate himself from the nuclear Harvey Weinstein scandal, Saturday Night Live’s Alec Baldwin admitted he has “bullied women.” Baldwin seemed all-too eager to prove himself correct Saturday by victim-blaming Rose McGowan and then lashing out at alleged-Weinstein rape victim Asia Argento.  During a Friday appearance on PBS, Baldwin dropped the bombshell that for decades he had heard rumors about McGowan being raped by Weinstein, that he heard these rumors “over and over … for decades and nothing was done.”  At this point the PBS interviewer says somewhat accusingly, “and nobody said anything.” Baldwin then explained why he said nothing by blaming McGowan for taking a settlement in 1997, instead of going to the authorities. Then Baldwin admits he did not know until now that she had taken the settlement:  What happened was that Rose McGowan took a payment of $100,000 and settled her case with him, and it was for Rose McGowan to prosecute that case … I had no idea, until now, that she had settled the case … Do the settlement of these cases hurt the cause of exposing and bringing us to a place of real change? When women take money and are silenced by that money, even though they took the money and were silenced because they were told, beyond the money, it was the right thing for them to do — keep quiet, don’t make too many waves, it is going to hurt your career. When they do it, nonetheless, does it set back the cause of change?  Baldwin’s logic here is off-the-charts nuts.  To begin with, let us never forget the 1990s, and how women were treated by the national media if they dared accuse a powerful Democrat, a close friend of the Clintons (as Weinstein was), of anything.  With the ruthless help of the national political media, most especially CNN, woman after woman after Kathleen Willey after Juanita Broaddrick after Paula Jones after Monica Lewinsky, were personally destroyed by Bill and Hillary Clinton.  Secondly, McGowan was just 23 years old.  Imagine, through no fault of your own, being thrust into the black heart of a well-oiled Hollywood Payoff Machine when you are just 23. Here is just the tip of an iceberg McGowan was witnessing in the national media during that dark time…  ABC’s Sam Donaldson demeaning Clinton mistress Gennifer Flowers as “some failed cabaret singer who doesn’t even have much of a resume to fall back on.”  Newsweek’s Evan Thomas on a DC talk show smearing Paula Jones as “some sleazy woman with big hair coming out of the trailer parks.”  CNN favorite James Carville grabbing the Newsweek baton with, “Drag a hundred dollars through a trailer park and there’s no telling what you’ll find.”  The entire elite infrastructure in Washington DC and the media, something Weinstein was comfortably a part of, had all of its guns trained on any woman who dared speak out. The media even remained on Clinton’s side after the IRS went after Paula Jones.  On top of this national climate, McGowan is being told that if she dares speak out against the most powerful man in Hollywood, no one will believe her, she will be personally destroyed, and her career will be ruined.  Did I mention that she was just 23 years old?  God bless her for demanding some form of justice from Weinstein.  Forward-fast to Saturday and as you might imagine, McGowan and Argento did not take kindly to Baldwin’s victim-blaming.

1437,3057,11,5,2017,2017-11-05,Breitbart,Gillespie Possibly Surging over Northam in Final Days of Virginia Governor’s Race,"Republican Ed Gillespie and Democrat Ralph Northam are virtually tied in the race for Virginia governor, but with signs that Gillespie may have come from behind to take the edge in the campaign’s final days.  Both candidates are focusing on issues that drive their respective party bases in a test of whether the Old Dominion has swung to the left, or can return to its center-right balance.  For much of the campaign, Gillespie has focused on bread-and-butter issues that Republicans typically use to persuade swing voters, talking about job creation, economic growth, reducing regulations, and improving education and health care. He was also running behind Northam for much of the campaign, despite the fact that Gillespie is a very seasoned and capable political strategist and campaigner.  Once a reliably red state, Virginia has trended sharply left in recent years, going for Barack Obama twice, and for Tim Kaine as governor and then as senator. The state also went for Hillary Clinton over President Donald Trump. Northam’s lead over Gillespie seemed due to this strong leftward current, given that Gillespie is a better candidate and his stand on swing-voter issues did better in the polls.  But in recent days, Gillespie has tapped into several of the issues that led to Republican victories in 2016, most notably Donald Trump’s nationwide victory with more Electoral College votes than any Republican since 1988.  Gillespie has come out swinging on immigration, hitting Northam hard for being soft on crime with an ad, “Left Wing Ralph Northam,” that explained, “MS-13 is a menace, yet Ralph Northam voted in favor of sanctuary cities that let dangerous illegal immigrants back on the street, increasing the threat of MS-13.”  Pushing back against the Far Left, Gillespie has also rallied to the defense of Virginia’s historical figures and monuments. Northam has said all of these statues and monuments must come down. In late October, a church in Alexandria, Virginia, where George Washington once attended has removed its plaque honoring America’s first president, showing how far that political movement has gone.  The Republican candidate has also been touting his support for the Second Amendment and pro-life causes, among other conservative priorities. The National Rifle Association—which is headquartered in Fairfax, Virginia—has also weighed in, pushing hard for Gillespie because of his support for gun owners.  On the other side of the ballot, Northam’s tactics have gotten desperate over the two weeks, corresponding to his lead evaporating.  Northam’s allies sparked national outrage recently, when the Latino Victory Fund ran an ad showing a pickup truck with a Gillespie bumper sticker running down children of color in the streets. A consensus has emerged that this ad is the most despicable low-blow of the entire 2017 election cycle, outraging voters and possibly backfiring on Northam’s campaign.  While Virginia has typically gone Democrat in recent years even when Republicans won nationally, a Gillespie victory would be a vindication of the principles President Trump ran on and a significant boost to the president’s agenda, potentially setting the stage to oust Tim Kaine from the Senate in 2018, and for Virginia to swing Republican in the 2020 national election for president.

1439,3059,11,5,2017,2017-11-05,Fox News,"Shocking Brazile expose drives Hillary camp into chaos, may throw key Virginia governor race to GOP","Donna Brazile's scathing review of Hillary Clinton’s failed 2016 presidential campaign sent more shock waves this weekend through the Democratic Party, with members eager to bury the Clinton era ahead of Tuesday’s key Virginia governor’s race and other upcoming elections.  “Those telling me to shut up … I tell them, 'Go to hell.' I’m gonna tell my story,” Brazile, who ran the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 White House race, on Sunday told ABC’s “This Week.”  Brazile roiled the political world on Thursday when she published excerpts in Politico of her upcoming book that detailed a 2015 money deal between the Clinton campaign and the DNC that made winning the party’s presidential nomination nearly impossible for any other Democratic candidate.  NBC News published a memorandum Saturday detailing the joint-fundraising agreement that shows the Clinton camp would have input on such key DNC decisions as hiring and spending, in exchange for helping the group with its roughly $20 million debt.  The memo also made clear that other potential candidates could enter into a similar agreement with the DNC.  But Brazile suggested Sunday that the authority the Clinton camp had under the agreement went beyond “standard” joint-fundraising agreements and that a “separate,” undisclosed deal also existed.  “I could not control the purse strings of the Democratic Party,” she said. “I become chair, and I'm trying to write a check for something that I raised money (for.) And they're like, 'You have to get that signed off on from Brooklyn.' This wasn’t a standard joint fundraising agreement. … They had separate memo of understanding.”  A review Saturday by The Washington Post of the book -- “Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns that Put Donald Trump in the White House” -- resulted in former Clinton campaign staffers penning an open letter, disputing Brazile’s accusations that the campaign was tone-deaf to middle-class voters, acted with a false sense of “inevitability” and in the closing weeks had “the odor of failure.”  According to the review, Brazile, who is African-American, also said she felt the campaign treated her like a “slave” and that she considered replacing Clinton with then-Vice President Joe Biden, after Clinton passed out during a 9/11 memorial ceremony in New York City.  “We were shocked to learn the news that Donna Brazile actively considered overturning the will of the Democratic voters by attempting to replace Hillary Clinton,” campaign members, including Robby Mook, John Podesta and Huma Abedin, in part said in the letter. “We are pretty tired of people who were not part of our campaign telling the world what it was like to be on the inside.”  To be sure, the scathing criticism of one long-standing Democrat on other members of her own party comes at a bad time -- days away from the Virginia gubernatorial race featuring Republican Ed Gillespie against Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam.  The RealClearPolitics polls average shows Northam now leading by 3 percentage points, essentially a dead heat, after leading by nearly 7 points just weeks ago.  “Donna Brazile going off the reservation right now is bad for Democrats,” Republican strategist Rory McShane told Fox News on Sunday. “But we’ve seen this before in off-year elections like in Georgia and South Carolina, where Democrats believed they’d win. This is just the latest case of no message, no organization, no leadership.”  Tom Perez, the new DNC chairman, on Saturday, after The Post review of Brazile’s book, rushed to assure Democrats that he would clean up the group’s mess ahead of the next presidential election cycle.  “While we’ve made remarkable progress since last November, we still have a long way to go,” he said in a statement. “I am more committed than ever before to restoring voters’ faith in our democratic process because even the perception of impartiality or an unfair advantage undermines our ability to win. That is unacceptable. To that end, the new DNC under my leadership is committed to the task of making sure that our 2020 nominating process will be unquestionably fair and transparent.”  Liz Smith, who was a spokeswoman for Martin O’Malley, another 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, on Saturday told Fox News’ “America’s News Headquarters”: “I know Donald Trump and Republicans would like to use Hillary Clinton as a whipping boy. But she’s in our past. We are moving beyond her.”",2.9166666666666665,6,"[3.5, 4.0, 2.5, 4.0, 1.5, 2.0]"
1440,3060,11,5,2017,2017-11-05,The New York Times,Opinion | Marco Rubio: Tax Reform Should Help American Families,"Having kids is one of life’s greatest experiences. It’s also expensive. Between school supplies and summer camps, sports and doctor’s visits, raising children increasingly takes more and more money. I should know — my wife, Jeanette, and I have four. We’ve been blessed in recent years, but I know what it’s like to start a family and struggle to make ends meet. My parents were immigrants who came to America with virtually nothing, and after I finished law school, I owed more than $100,000 in student loans.  There’s a reason many people feel it’s harder to afford children now than in previous generations. It’s true. According to federal data adjusted for inflation, from 1960 to 2015 the average annual cost of raising a child in a middle-income family rose by over $11,000. It’s now estimated that middle-class parents will spend more than $230,000 over the course of their son or daughter’s childhood — and that doesn’t even include college tuition.  Ask just about any couple and they’ll tell you this absolutely influences their decisions about when to have children and how many to have. As the economist Lyman Stone has shown, by 2012, the average number of children American women intended to have was 2.37, and the total fertility rate was 1.88 — a gap of about 0.5 children on average. Since the 1960s, there has been a consistent gap between intended and total fertility, even as the number of children American women desire to have and the total birthrate have declined over time.  There are many causes for this gap, but the increasing cost of childbearing clearly has played a role in its development. For example, think of families who delayed having children for a few years until they were more financially stable and may not have been able to have as many as they initially wanted. Or parents who wanted more children, but after their first or second realized they couldn’t afford the combined cost of taking care of the child and reducing their work hours. The German economist Anna Raute has isolated this “opportunity cost” of childbearing as a significant factor in fertility decisions.",2.5,3,"[0.5, 2.5, 4.5]"

Jeff Hoover denied sexually harassing the staff member, but said he sent inappropriate text messages that were consensual. Hoover’s wife and two of his three daughters were in the room as he spoke.  “I engaged in banter that was consensual but make no mistake it was wrong on my part to do that. And for that, I am truly sorry,” Hoover said. “I want to reiterate that at no time, at no time did I engage in unwelcome or unwanted conduct of any kind.”  Thomas Clay, a Louisville attorney who represents the victim, said his client had “legitimate concerns about workplace conduct.”  “Our client was not coerced by anyone to resolve the matter and has been satisfied with the resolution,” Clay said. “We look forward to moving past this matter.”  Hoover said he will remain in the legislature. House Speaker Pro Tempore David Osborne will become the acting speaker.  The resignation comes amid a brutal legislative fight to change the state’s struggling public pension system. Gov. Matt Bevin’s proposal would eventually end Kentucky’s pension system and replace it with a 401(k)-style retirement plan for state workers and public school teachers.  The bill has the votes in the Senate, but not the House. Hoover had said he would not vote for the bill without changes, and he has been critical of some of Bevin’s comments about teachers and other state workers.  “It’s fair to say I am not the favorite legislator of some in this capitol,” Hoover said without mentioning Bevin’s name.  On Saturday afternoon, House Republican leaders announced they planned to hire a private law firm to investigate the allegations and would grant them the power to subpoena witnesses. A news release Sunday said the investigation will continue.  Hoover said he received a letter on Oct. 17 from a lawyer whose client made allegations of sexual harassment against Hoover and others. He said everyone reached an agreement on Oct. 25. Hoover said no one admitted wrongdoing and everyone agreed to keep the settlement secret because the victim was going to keep her job.  But Wednesday evening, The Courier-Journal reported the settlement, based on anonymous sources, which eventually led to Hoover’s resignation.  Hoover has been speaker since January, shortly after Republicans won a majority in the state House for the first time in nearly a century. The victory gave Republicans control of every state legislative chamber in the South.  “I have asked for and received forgiveness from God, my family, my wonderful wife, Karen, and my daughters,” Hoover said. “The decision today is what is best for Kentucky.

Researchers in Mexico were thrilled to have captured one of the few remaining vaquita porpoises on Saturday, Nov. 4, but the adult female died after a few hours in captivity in a floating pen, raising questions about the last-ditch effort to enclose the world's smallest porpoises to save them from extinction. (AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell, File)  MEXICO CITY (AP) — Researchers were thrilled to have captured one of the few remaining vaquita porpoises, but announced Sunday that the adult female died after a few hours in captivity in a floating pen, raising questions about the last-ditch effort to enclose the world’s smallest porpoises to save them from extinction.  Critics, and even supporters of the international rescue effort, knew the plan was full of risks: The small marine mammals native to Mexico’s Gulf of California have never been held in captivity, much less bred there.  But with estimates of the remaining population falling below 30, the international team of experts known as Vaquita CPR felt they had no choice. In late October, researchers captured a vaquita calf but quickly freed it because it was showing signs of stress and was too young to survive without its mother.  On Saturday, the team felt its luck had turned when it caught a female in reproductive age. Mexico’s environment secretary, Rafael Pacchiano, tweeted a photo of the vaquita in a net sling late Saturday, saying: “This is a great achievement that fills us with hope.”  The vaquita was taken to a protected floating pen in the Gulf of California in the hopes that it would survive, and possibly breed if more vaquitas could be captured.  But on Sunday, the team said, “Veterinarians monitoring the vaquita’s health noticed the animal’s condition began to deteriorate and made the determination to release.”  “The release attempt was unsuccessful and life-saving measures were administered,” the team wrote. “Despite the heroic efforts of the veterinary team, the vaquita did not survive.”  “The entire rescue team is heartbroken by this devastating loss” wrote the team, which is using U.S. Navy-trained dolphins to help find the elusive species in the upper Gulf of California, also known as the Sea of Cortez. “The risk of losing a vaquita during field operations was always acknowledged as a possibility, but it was determined that it was unacceptable to stand by and watch the vaquita porpoise disappear without a heroic attempt at rescue.”  If it proves impossible to safely capture vaquitas, experts say an all-out effort will be needed to save them in their natural habitat. Vaquita populations have been decimated by illegal nets used to catch totoaba fish, whose swim bladder is prized in China.  “We are deeply saddened to learn that the vaquita captured on Saturday has died. We are confident that the experts involved in the capture did their best,” said Alejandro Olivera, the Mexico representative for the Center for Biological Diversity. “However, this should be a reminder for the Mexican government that ‘Plan A’ should never be forgotten. To truly protect these incredible little porpoises, the Mexican government must once and for all get deadly gillnets out of the vaquita’s habitat.”  Mexico has moved to ban gillnet fishing in the area, mounted a campaign to confiscate nets, and is trying to stop illegal fishing. But given the enormously high prices that totoaba swim bladders fetch on the black market, fishermen have used go-fast boats and stealth tactics that are hard to stop.  The environmental protection unit of the federal Attorney General’s Office said Sunday that authorities had seized four miles (6.4 kilometers) of nets, 5 metric tons of shrimp, and one shrimp boat as part of enforcement efforts in the second half of October. Authorities also seized three smaller boats and four vehicles.",3.3333333333333335,3,"[3.0, 3.5, 3.5]"

Mary Bono, R-Calif., listens at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington. One current and three former female members of Congress tell The Associated Press they have been sexually harassed or subjected to hostile sexual comments by their male colleagues while serving in the House. For years Bono endured the increasingly suggestive comments from a fellow lawmaker in the House. But when the congressman approached her on the House floor and told her he’d been thinking about her in the shower, she’d had enough. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Leading lawmakers are calling for mandatory training and other steps to prevent sexual harassment in Congress as the national spotlight on gender hostility in the workplace falls on Capitol Hill.  The calls from House Speaker Paul Ryan and others follow a series of news reports about women staffers and lawmakers experiencing harassment and sexual advances on the job. The Associated Press reported Friday on the experiences of one current and three former female lawmakers, who said they had fended off unwanted advances, sexual comments and, in one case, physical contact from a male colleague in Congress. The issue was already in the national spotlight because of the sex assault allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein and a growing list of boldface names in entertainment and the media.  On Friday, Ryan sent lawmakers a letter urging them to undergo sexual harassment training and make it mandatory for their staffs.  “Any form of harassment has no place in this institution. Each of us has a responsibility to ensure a workplace that is free from discrimination, harassment, and retaliation,” wrote Ryan, R-Wis. “We can and should lead by example.”  House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi called for passage of Democratic-sponsored legislation that would require anti-harassment training, enhance anti-retaliation protections for staffers who report harassment, and streamline dispute resolution. The recent focus on the issue has made clear that Congress’ tendency to self-police has resulted in lax rules, a patchwork of policies that vary from one office to another, and a complaints clearinghouse lodged in an Office of Compliance that requires a lengthy counseling and mediation period — and that many staffers have not even heard of.  Pelosi said all that needs to change.  “I think we are at a tipping point in our country,” the California Democrat told The Associated Press. “For a long time the Congress was a place where every congressional office had its own rules. ... The system needs to be changed.”  The House Administration Committee, which oversees the operations of the House, also announced plans to convene a hearing Nov. 14 focused on training, policies and mechanisms in place to guard against and report sexual harassment.  In the Senate, New York Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand, who went public several years ago with accounts of inappropriate comments from male senators, also announced legislation on the issue. Gillibrand’s bill would streamline the reporting process within the Office of Compliance, remove the current mediation requirement and give interns the same resources as full-time staff.  “Congress should never be above the law or play by their own set of rules. The current process has little accountability and even less sensitivity to victims of sexual harassment,” Gillibrand said.  GOP Rep. Mary Bono told AP she once confronted a male colleague on the floor of the House after he made repeated suggestive comments, including telling her he’d thought about her in the shower. The behavior stopped, but the lawmaker remains in the House, she said.  Rep. Linda Sanchez described being propositioned repeatedly in years past by one lawmaker who still serves, and ogled and groped by a second who’s since left the House. Former Rep. Hilda Solis disclosed repeated come-ons from a lawmaker, but declined to go into detail, while former Sen. Barbara Boxer described a years-ago incident at a hearing where a lawmaker made a sexually suggestive comment about her from the dais that the committee chairman seconded.  The female lawmakers declined to identify the men they were talking about, and did not report the incidents, with a couple of them noting it was not clear where they would have lodged such a complaint.  On Friday, additional female lawmakers offered public comments on the situations that can result in an environment that is only 20 percent women and still beholden in some ways to out-of-date traditions.  Rep. Cheri Bustos, D-Ill., said she has asked friends and colleagues in the House whether they knew of any woman who had advanced in their careers without being sexually harassed. “Without exception, they don’t know of anybody,” Bustos said. “We are all talking about it because it’s rampant. It’s absolutely rampant.”  As to whether she herself had been harassed by any fellow member, Bustos said: “It depends on how you want to define harassment.”  “How I’ve chosen to handle it is I just sort of dismiss it and I don’t give it another thought,” Bustos said. “I hope what happens out of all of this news coverage is it changes some people’s behavior as far as comments they make, or if it’s worse than that. I hope something good comes out of it.”  ___  Associated Press writers Kevin Freking and Matthew Daly contributed to this report.",3.375,4,"[4.0, 5.0, 1.5, 3.0]"
1383,2992,11,4,2017,2017-11-04,Breitbart,Steve Bannon: Central Issue of 2016 Election Was ‘Sovereignty of Our Country’," Former White House chief strategist and Breitbart News executive chairman Stephen K. Bannon declared to a passionate room full of immigration activists on Saturday that the sovereignty of the United States has been the central issue of the 2016 presidential election, of fights on Capitol Hill, and within the Republican Party.  Bannon took the crowd gathered for the Remembrance Project event back through several points of the 2016 election, such as then-candidate Donald Trump’s trip to Mexico to meet with the Mexican President about immigration, and the subsequent visit to Phoenix, Arizona, meeting with Angel moms and holding a rally.  Bannon said people remember that the biggest fight in the Republican Party and on Capitol Hill hasn’t been taxes, Obamacare, or Afghanistan, “It’s been the central issue of the sovereignty of our country.”  “It was the stories and putting the faces to these stories to the American people that was the key that picked the lock for President Trump’s victory,” said Bannon.  He went on to list the names of about a dozen Americans, many merely in their teens, who have been the victims of violent crime by illegal aliens in the United States. At Bannon’s request, the crowd then applauded and rose to their feet to honor these fallen Americans.  He asked the crowd why illegal aliens are called “DREAMers” rather than these Americans who won’t get to live out their dreams.  “This is not some random law of the universe,” said Bannon. He called out the “economic, the political, and the media elites,” for allowing this to happen, for wanting it to happen, calling their actions “an act of commission.” He called out the corporations that want cheap labor and the progressives who want “cheap votes.”  Bannon called out the suppression of information on illegal immigration and the stories of those killed by illegal aliens. “Why was this suppressed?” He called out 60 Minutes, NBC, and CNN for going around the world to show everything wrong with America but ignoring those victimized by illegal immigration. He pinpointed the issue of whom the victims are: “Hispanic and black and Asian and white working class men and women, the backbone of this country.”  He spoke of the contempt of elites for those in the room, crediting the efforts of those at the event, a “handful of journalists,” and Donald J. Trump for shining a light on the issue of illegal immigration.  Bannon went on to emphasize that for the political elites, “The only business they’re in is the business of getting re-elected.” He spoke also of Trump’s 10-point plan on immigration.  He pointed to the ouster of Eric Cantor, a member of the Republican leadership, by someone with far less money who talked about the problem of illegal immigration. He then turned to talk of the Virginia governor’s race being held in just a few days and the 2018 elections. Bannon stressed the importance of Virginia Republican gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie talking about issues like illegal immigration if he wants to get Trump voters to turn out to help him win the election.  Bannon told the crowd that the elites hold them in contempt and are willing to hide information for their own money and power.  He called out House Speaker Paul Ryan and warned of the trouble to come in those 2018 elections if Ryan tries to slip amnesty through.  “It’s obvious to everybody that we’re going to have to take over the Republican Party,” said Bannon. They can “go the easy way or the hard way, but they’re goin’.”  He spoke of the mountains of money the Republican establishment uses to try to win elections, like in Alabama, where Judge Roy Moore beat the establishment candidate. Bannon pointed out that now “the more money they spend the fewer votes they get.” He added, “We’ve turned their greatest asset, their money, into their greatest liability.” He said that candidates are no longer seeking Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s endorsement but are now “running from it.”  Bannon said that Trump is on track to be one of the greatest presidents, like Reagan, Lincoln, or Jackson, but he has to “just stick to the plan.”  He told the crowd that the fight in 2018 is going to be so “nasty,” but he’s glad to be on their side. He told them that they represent the 12-13 generations of working class, middle-class people. Referencing Trump’s 2016 election wins in Wisconsin, North Carolina, and Missouri, Bannon told the crowd that the Majority Leader owes his position to them.  Bannon closed with a warning, saying, “you’ve got tough days ahead of you” but with encouragement to “hang in there and fight.”  Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana",1.5833333333333333,6,"[3.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 3.5]"

Daniel Stiles, a self-styled ape trafficking detective in Kenya, had been scouring Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp for weeks, looking for pictures of gorillas, chimps or orangutans. He was hoping to chip away at an illicit global trade that has captured or killed tens of thousands of apes and pushed some endangered species to the brink of extinction.  “The way they do business,” he said of ape traffickers, “makes the Mafia look like amateurs.”  After hundreds of searches, Mr. Stiles found an Instagram account offering dozens of rare animals for sale, including baby chimpanzees and orangutans dressed in children’s clothes. He sent an email to an address on the account — “looking for young otans” (the industry standard slang for orangutans) — and several days later received a reply.  “2 babies, 7.5k each. Special introductory price.”  The trafficker identified himself only as Tom and said he was based in Southeast Asia. Mr. Stiles knew what Tom was hoping for: to sell the infant orangutans to a private collector or unscrupulous zoo, where they are often beaten or drugged into submission and used for entertainment like mindlessly banging on drums or boxing one another. Such ape shows are a growing business in Southeast Asia, despite international regulations that prohibit trafficking in endangered apes.  Several weeks later, after a few more rounds of text messages with Tom to firm up the details, Mr. Stiles decided to fly to Bangkok.  “I was way out on a limb,” Mr. Stiles admitted later.

Bannon.  During a speech to The Remembrance Project members, the organization that represents American victims of illegal alien crimes, Bannon said it was “obvious” that populist, pro-American immigration reformers are taking over the Republican Party.  “We’re going to have a lot more victories,” Bannon said. “And it’s obvious to everybody that we’re going to have to take over the Republican Party. Now the elites in the Republican Party can either go the easy way or the hard way, but they’re going.”  Bannon said Americans would continue to have to push back against efforts by the Republican establishment and party elites to ram through legislation that would give amnesty to millions of illegal aliens.  “If you think about the last couple of days, this is why I’m saying it’s never going to stop, it’s never going to go away, you’re going to have to do this every day, day in and day out, you’re going to have to fight,” Bannon said to the victims’ families. “November 9th is just another day. We got a victory, we’re going to have defeats, right. But I know you’re going to have a lot more Judge Moores than we’re going to have Bob Corkers.”  “Remember in Alabama, Judge Moore had $2 million, they had $32 million,” Bannon said.  “They put $32 million on Judge Moore to destroy him and his wife and his family. Just like they did Donald Trump. Did Hillary bring up this?” Bannon asked as he pointed to a wall of photos of illegal alien crime victims. “Did they ever bring up this? Did they ever want to talk about this? Did she ever want to give a speech on this? She ever want to address this? She ever come and talk to you folks? None. You know why? They can’t win on that, right? They just want politics of personal destruction. That’s all they dumped on Donald Trump.”  “But here’s the thing that we’ve proven now with authentic candidates and a great set of ideas and a message and you know, grassroots folks who are enthusiastic and go door-to-door: the more money they spend, the fewer votes they get,” Bannon said of the Republican establishment. “That’s an iron-clad calculus. You all have been able to flip in Alabama and we’re doing it, you see it all the time now on this insurgency in the United States Senate, that we’ve turned their biggest asset, their money, into their biggest liability.”  “We’ve made Mitch McConnell so toxic,” Bannon said. “You got Orrin Hatch, you got Heller, you got all these folks, they’re not looking for Mitch’s endorsement. They’re running from it.”  While House Speaker Paul Ryan has reportedly failed to get an amnesty deal for illegal aliens slipped into an end-of-the-year spending bill, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says that he wants all immigration deals to include an amnesty for illegal aliens.

1401,3010,11,4,2017,2017-11-04,Vox,The White House’s new climate report contradicts everything Trump is doing on climate,"A new government report on the science of climate change has made it past the Trump White House unscathed with forceful statements about humanity’s role in rising temperatures and their severe threat to the United States.  “This assessment concludes, based on extensive evidence, that it is extremely likely that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century,” according to the Climate Science Special Report. “For the warming over the last century, there is no convincing alternative explanation supported by the extent of the observational evidence.”  The US Global Change Research Program is required by statute to produce the comprehensive National Climate Assessment report on climate change impacts on the United States every four years. It is overseen by the Executive Office of the President and receives input from 13 federal agencies.  The special report, meant to thoroughly address the state of the science, is the first volume of the assessment. The rest is due out in 2018.  Scientists were concerned that the Trump administration would take steps to undermine or censor the report or its conclusions, leading some authors to contact reporters to publicize a draft to try to get ahead of any interference.  And those concerns were valid, given that President Trump has made it his mission to undo Obama’s legacy, particularly on climate change.  Trump has famously described climate change as a “hoax,” and put forward a budget proposal that cuts funding for climate research. He vowed to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement, and his executive branch has shown a penchant for removing the words “climate change” from websites.  But when it came to the release of the Climate Science Special Report, the administration did not interfere. The report was released on time, and it definitively affirms that the science around climate change is robust and the problem is urgent.  “There is broad consensus that the further and the faster the Earth system is pushed towards warming, the greater the risk of unanticipated changes and impacts, some of which are potentially large and irreversible,” according to the report.  None of the findings are particularly novel, and drafts of the reports have been in circulation since January. But they are striking in how much they stand in contrast to the policies and statements of the Trump administration.  Trump has worked hard to appoint and staff his administration with people loyal to the fossil fuel sector and is coming up with absurd strategies to attempt to resurrect coal in the United States.  Meanwhile, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt told CNBC that he doesn’t think human-produced carbon dioxide is driving climate change. “I would not agree that it's a primary contributor to the global warming that we see,” he said.  Pruitt is quickly and quietly working to undo many of his agency’s regulations on pollution and is driving out his agency’s science advisers in favor of those representing industry.  Energy Secretary Rick Perry has also said that human activity is not the main driver of climate change. “No, most likely the primary control knob is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in,” he told CNBC.  Over at the White House Office of Management and Budget, Director Mick Mulvaney told reporters in March that spending federal money on climate science is “a waste of your money.”  For its part, the White House tried to soften the main conclusion of the report it approved.

1191,2789,11,4,2017,2017-11-04,Vox,6 ways climate change and disease helped topple the Roman Empire,"Americans have always loved to compare themselves to the ancient Romans. Our political language and ideology are suffused with Latin influences like “capitol,” “forum,” and “senate”; the neoclassical style is our federal architecture; our very model of a constitutional republic is deeply indebted to Rome’s example.  Naturally, the example of a great, seemingly indomitable power fading into ruin haunts the American imagination. The Roman Empire at its height stretched from the edges of Scotland to the sands of the Sahara, from the shores of the Atlantic to the hills of Syria. Economically, the Romans engineered one of the greatest “golden ages” of any preindustrial society. The empire was generous in granting Roman citizenship throughout its vast territory, and by making subjects into citizens, the empire helped to unleash the cultural potential of the provinces under Roman sway.  By the time of the first emperor Augustus (who ruled from 27 BC to AD 14), the Romans controlled virtually the entire Mediterranean shoreline, and they kept it for nearly half a millennium.  The empire reached its height in the middle of the second century. Although the great English chronicler of Rome’s fall, Edward Gibbon, described a long process of decline followed by piecemeal disintegration, today’s historians are skeptical of the idea of a slow decline. Rather, fiscal, social, and geopolitical challenges mounted and then suddenly overwhelmed the Romans.  The fall came in two parts: German kingdoms replaced Roman rule in the West in the fifth century, then Arab conquerors seized the prize parts of the Eastern empire in the middle of the seventh century. Of course, the underlying causes have always been hotly debated. Did the Romans tax too little or too much? Was there class conflict underneath the political regime?  But in recent years historians have also started to revisit the fall of the Roman Empire with an openness to the importance of environmental factors, including climate change and pandemic disease. Thanks to amazing new evidence from the natural sciences, we can now see that, while the human factors remain integral, they are sometimes just the surface effects of the deeper and more powerful forces of nature.  The story of Rome, ultimately, reminds us of the fragility of human societies in the face of nature and our precarious dependence on the fickle planet that is our home.  Here are six ways that the environment — physical and biological — brought down the mighty empire.  The Romans were enormously lucky when it came to climate. Then they got less lucky.  Today, greenhouse gas emissions are altering the earth’s climate at an alarming pace, but climate change is nothing new. Slight variations in the tilt, spin, and orbit of the earth change the amount and distribution of solar energy reaching its surface; the sun itself emits variable amounts of radiation; volcanoes spew ash that hangs in the upper atmosphere and reflects heat back into space. Historians have only recently begun to take into account the gold rush of new data about the climate in the classical world.  It turns out the Romans were lucky. The centuries during which the empire was built and flourished are known even to climate scientists as the “Roman Climate Optimum.” From circa 200 BC to AD 150, it was warm, wet, and stable across much of the territory the Romans conquered. In an agricultural economy, these conditions were a major boost to GDP. The population swelled yet still there was enough food to feed everyone.  But from the middle of the second century, the climate became less reliable. The all-important annual Nile flood became erratic. Droughts and severe cold spells became more common. The Climate Optimum became much less optimal.  The lesson to be drawn is not, of course, that we shouldn't worry about man-made climate change today, which threatens to be more severe than what the Romans experienced. To the contrary, it shows just how sensitive human societies can be to such change — now amplified in speed and scope by human activity.  Globalization brought great wealth — and disease  In the AD 160s, at the apex of Roman dominance, the empire fell victim to one of history’s first recorded pandemics — an event known as the “Antonine Plague” (after the family name of the ruling dynasty). It was unprecedented in magnitude. Death tolls are hard to come by, but the outbreak took the life of something like 7 or 8 eight million victims. By comparison, the worst defeat in Roman military history claimed around 20,000 lives.  Its cause remains debated, but the likeliest candidate is the smallpox virus or an ancestor of smallpox (a virus that may have evolved not long before this outbreak, most likely in Africa). The Romans traded throughout the Indian Ocean world, across the Red and Persian Seas; their ships reached India and the East African coast.  This trading network carried spices and precious metals and slaves — and germs. Unleashed inside the densely settled and interconnected Roman Empire, the new pathogen was devastating. The Roman Empire survived the Antonine Plague, but the social order was unsettled. From that moment onward, maintaining Rome’s dominance along the frontiers became a greater challenge.  A second pandemic pushes social institutions past the breaking point  The empire rebounded from the Antonine Plague behind the vigorous rule of an African-Syrian dynasty known as the Severans. But in the AD 240s, a ferocious drought struck. Close on its heels, another pandemic, known as the Plague of Cyprian, broke out. The biological agent of this pestilence remains a mystery (though genomic evidence may yet turn up), but its impact is clear. It wasted the population from one end of the empire to the other.  The resulting demographic crisis triggered a total meltdown of the entire imperial system, known as the “crisis of the third century.” Enemies poured across every border, piercing deep into parts of the empire which had not seen war for centuries. One emperor after another seized the throne.  The crisis is considered the “first fall” of the Roman Empire. The empire did reemerge, but with at least two profound changes. First, the empire was henceforth ruled by a different kind of emperor: A cadre of military officers from the provinces along the Danube seized control from the old, wealthy, Mediterranean aristocracy.  Second, the plague led to a crackdown on Christians that backfired mightily. At first, the Roman authorities blamed the pestilence on the Christian religious minority, and they set about trying to extirpate it. The church not only withstood the violent attacks but campaigned to care for the sick and bury the dead amid the pestilence — earning respect. Christianity grew more rapidly than ever in the aftermath of this trial.  Climate change prodded the Huns to move, setting up a chain reaction  The Roman Empire in the fourth century, led now by Christian emperors, enjoyed a kind of second golden age. But it was not destined to last. In the last decades of the fourth century and the first decades of the fifth century, the empire suffered a series of military defeats unlike anything in its history — at the hands of the Goths. But the Goths, in turn, were prodded to move against the Romans because of an incursion into Europe of Huns, from central Asia.  New paleoclimate evidence helps to explain why the Huns suddenly moved West. The Huns were nomads, native to the great belt of steppe that stretches from Hungary to Mongolia, an arid zone that depends on westerly mid-latitude storm tracks for rain.  Tree rings suggest that a megadrought in the middle of the fourth century might have made these nomads desperate for greener pastures. As they migrated West, they terrified the highly developed kingdoms, such as those of the Goths, that had long existed along Rome’s frontier. Partly because of this climate-caused upheaval, the Goths challenged Rome’s frontiers as never before. Rome’s Western territories ended up being carved up and reconfigured as Germanic kingdoms.  The Late Antique Little Ice Age  We rightly fear climate change in the form of global warming, but in the later Roman Empire, the greater danger was sudden sharp cooling. While the Western half of the empire fell, the Eastern, Greek half of the empire, now centered on New Rome, a.k.a. Constantinople, thrived.  In fact, during the reign of Justinian (who ruled from 527 to 65), the Roman Empire found new glory. In the first part of his reign, Justinian codified all of Roman law, went on the grandest building spree in Christian history (including erecting the Hagia Sophia), and took back Roman Africa and Italy.  But then came perhaps the worst environmental catastrophe yet: the dual blow of a little ice age and yet another pandemic. In the 530s and 540s, volcanic eruptions rocked the globe. We have long known that in the year 536 there was no summer; for about 15 months, the sun seemed to shine only dimly, unnerving people worldwide. In recent years, careful work on tree rings and polar ice cores has clarified what happened.  First, in AD 536, there was a massive eruption in the Northern Hemisphere. Second, in AD 539/40, a tropical volcano erupted. The result was not just a year of darkness but truly staggering global cooling: The decade 536 to 545 was the coldest decade of the last 2000 years, with average summer temperatures in Europe falling by up to 2.5 degrees Celsius. And this was no passing phenomenon. For a century and a half, colder temperatures prevailed across large parts of the Northern Hemisphere.  The first black death  Just as the climate started to turn colder, the plague appeared on the Southern shores of the Mediterranean — in AD 541. This was true bubonic plague, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, the agent of the more famous medieval Black Death.  Thanks to remarkable analysis of its genome, the history of this bacterium is now well understood. The plague is at root a disease of rodents, and had been endemic among social burrowing rodents in central Asia. It probably traveled to Rome across the trading networks that carried silks from China to the Mediterranean. The plague first spread from one rodent species to another, carried by fleas — ultimately infecting black rats, which live in close quarters with humans. Once the bacterium reached the rats of the Roman Empire, it was mayhem.  This precursor to the more famous European “Black Death” of the middle ages may have carried off half of the entire population of the Roman Empire. The immediate (and insuperable) problem was disposing of the corpses; the longer-range problem was managing an empire with a severely weakened tax base and a serious manpower shortage — including in the army.  What’s more, the first pandemic inspired a wave of apocalyptic fervor. The pandemic not only wrecked Justinian’s dream of restoring Roman glory; it triggered a spiral of dissolution and state failure that stretched over the next century. One insidious aspect of plague is that it does not vanish after its initial work. It became permanently established in rodent colonies inside the Roman Empire and broke out repeatedly, every 10 to 20 years, unleashing new destruction each time. This helped push the Romans past the breaking point. By the middle of the seventh century, very little remained of the “eternal empire.”  Kyle Harper is professor of classics and letters, and senior vice president and provost at the University of Oklahoma.

1405,3019,11,4,2017,2017-11-04,Vox,The GOP says its business tax plan will help workers and small businesses. It won’t.,"Edward Kleinbard analyzed the Republican tax “framework” earlier this month. The bill introduced this week contains the elements he discusses, with one caveat: It attempts to constrain taxpayers from converting compensation income into “pass-through” income, which would be taxed at a preferential 25 percent rate. (For instance, an active manager of a pass-through business would be entitled to treat only 30 percent of his share of income from that source as qualifying for the preferential tax rate.) But it’s too soon to know whether those limitations will be effective, or if they will even end up in the final legislation:  To understand the business tax provisions in the Trump tax proposals, begin with F. Scott Fitzgerald’s insight that the rich are different from you and me — they have more money.  In particular, they have more capital. (Ever polite, economists call piles of money that have been invested “capital.”) Business tax reform really is an exercise in how we should tax capital income — that is, returns on investments. And because the rich have lots more capital than do you or I, the benefits of the multitrillion-dollar business tax cuts proposed by the Trump administration’s tax “framework” necessarily will be vacuumed up by the most affluent Americans. Business tax reform has only a modest connection to the economic future of working stiffs, and the small connection that does exist is a second-order effect.  The Trump framework offers two critical tax cuts for businesses and their owners: First, it reduces the tax rate on corporate income from 35 to 20 percent; and second, it caps the taxes imposed on owners of “pass-through” businesses like partnerships and S corporations, by creating a new 25 percent tax bracket for those owners’ pass-through income.  (As Republicans never tire of pointing out, regular corporations and their shareholders in theory are subject to double taxation — once when the income is earned by the corporation and again when it’s distributed as taxable dividends to individual shareholders. This rule, however, is honored almost exclusively in the breach. By contrast, the owners of “pass-through” entities are taxed directly on the income of their pass-throughs. Most privately owned companies are organized as pass-throughs; virtually all publicly traded companies are taxed as corporations.)  The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimates that the changes to corporate and pass-through tax rates, plus some ancillary rules, will slash tax collections by more than $2.6 trillion in forgone revenue over the next 10 years. By contrast, the purely individual provisions in the Trump plan are estimated to raise about $500 billion in taxes from all of us over the same period. So, viewing things in the aggregate, the overall tax cuts promised by the framework are entirely a story about the business tax side of things: The individual side is a net tax hike. More particularly, the overall impact of the tax framework is a story about who benefits from business tax cuts.  Corporate tax cuts fall on real people. Which ones?  Mitt Romney was right when he said that corporations don’t pay taxes — people do. You’ve never seen a corporation walking down the sidewalk, because it’s a legal fiction. In the end, one group of people or another shoulders the burden of the corporate tax, or in this case enjoys the benefits of slashing the rate to 20 percent. But which people?  President Trump and other apologists for the Republican plan insist that they’re not in it for the money for themselves, but are simply the selfless servants of the average worker. They argue that a lower corporate rate translates directly into higher wages. Now, it is true that one can construct simple models that imply such a result, but the reason they do is that within these models, a high corporate tax chases capital investment away from the United States to lower-taxed countries, so that capital can enjoy higher after-tax returns, leaving less capital behind invested in the productivity of each American worker.  These models do not apply to the modern American multinational corporation, as several studies have found. For that reason, the US Treasury in recent years has assumed that 82 percent of the burden of the corporate tax (or the benefit of a corporate tax rate cut) falls on the shoulders of owners of capital, not working Joes, and the leading nonpartisan economic institutions and analysts Congress relies on (namely the Congressional Budget Office and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation) employ similar rules of thumb.  In fact, the Treasury economists’ careful work here is so damning to the framework’s enterprise that the political bosses at Treasury have ordered the study removed from its website.  Even within the small fraction thought to fall on labor, these agencies conclude that labor bears its share of the corporate tax in proportion to incomes. So top executives, with their outsize compensation, would get the lion’s share of any portion of a corporate tax cut attributable to labor.  As it happens, there is good reason to reduce the corporate tax rate. But that’s principally because the full 35 percent rate applies so unevenly and to relatively few corporations. One sophisticated study concluded that the average tax rate actually paid by US corporations (their “effective” tax rate) was about 23 percent — or 32 percent if one pretended that all corporate income was immediately distributed as dividends. And when it comes to US multinationals, the results are even more skewed, due to what I’ve dubbed their “stateless income” shenanigans. Microsoft, for example, announced to shareholders that in 2016, its US operations lost $325 million.  Fortunately, it booked $20 billion in profits outside the United States! A close examination of its tax footnote in its financials reveals that its foreign earnings bear an effective foreign tax rate of around 5 percent. As even the tax framework acknowledges, tax reform here will be all about imposing a minimum tax as a floor on companies’ stateless income planning.  We find ourselves back at the central question. To understand who benefits from business tax rate cuts, we need to ask: Who owns capital in America? Unlike many other tax imponderables, we actually know a lot about this.  Capital income is much more concentrated, in fact, than is overall income: The top 1 percent captures about 21 percent of overall income in the United States (itself quite extraordinary) but double that proportion of capital income. What’s more, capital ownership in the United States is extraordinarily concentrated at the very top of the top end: Those with wealth exceeding $20 million (the top one-thousandth, or 0.1 percent) own as much as do the bottom 90 percent.  Despite GOP claims, the new rate on “pass-through” entities won’t do much for small businesses  The overall lesson is plain: The average line worker is not the principal beneficiary of corporate rate reduction. Nor, we can safely say, is Ma and Pa Kettle’s Muffler Shop the prototypical pass-through business that will benefit from the 25 percent rate cap on pass-through income.  Taxpayers who receive income from pass-throughs pay at the individual rate. The framework’s proposal for special tax treatment for pass-throughs is being pitched as something that will help small businesses, but it confuses small businesses with pass-through businesses. The real advantages will flow to large pass-throughs and the most affluent investors. The top 1 percent of Americans earn 69 percent of all pass-through income; they are the ones who will garner the benefits of the preferential pass-through rate.  Genuinely small businesses aren’t the object here, given that without the special deal incomes, up to $233,000 (married filing jointly) would be taxed at 25 percent simply by virtue of the new tax brackets. And, as it happens, the average tax rate imposed on pass-throughs today is around 19 percent, making the case for providing a 25 percent ceiling on pass-through tax rates even tougher to see.  Lower pass-through rates will also redirect energy away from business productivity into creative tax accounting. Lawyers go to work to shoehorn back into the 25 percent preferential rate whatever income Congress purports to exclude from it.  Meanwhile, owner-entrepreneurs will be induced to engage in what I call “labor stuffing.” Instead of paying herself a salary, the owner-entrepreneur will extract her share of her firm’s earnings in the form of business income, thereby masquerading labor income as qualifying capital income. I’ve spent an enormous amount of time working on this problem in a related context, and have proposed a technical solution (short version here). The “Big Six” lawmakers who drafted the framework have done no work to address this.  But what about growth? Surely the Tax Policy Center’s $2.6 trillion deficit-ballooning estimate for the cost of the plan’s business tax gifts will lead to faster growth that will make all of us better off, and offset the apparent cost of the framework to boot? Would that it were so, but responsible economists agree that this is just not true, whether one looks to history (most recently, Kansas) or theory. The idea that the growth fairy can be propitiated only through tax cuts is faith-based economics.  The tax framework will produce a multitrillion-dollar increase in our deficits by forgoing tax revenues in order to cut taxes on the very must affluent. This spurt in deficits will impede, not accelerate, growth, by increasing the interest rates paid by US businesses. It also will make our ability to respond to the next recession that much more precarious.  Look at it this way: When interest rates are still near their lowest levels in decades, and banks are lending, where is the evidence that firms right now are facing difficulty in finding the capital to invest in attractive opportunities? There is none. In fact, the framework’s combination of expensing business investments and permitting at least some interest deductions would reduce the effective (real-life) tax rates on those investments below zero, which means that we all would be subsidizing firms in replacing American workers by machines.  Who cares if the rich get richer?  Finally, it might be suggested that only envy can explain my preoccupation — and that of other commentators — with how generous the framework’s business tax cuts are to the most affluent Americans. So long as low- and middle-income taxpayers are also better off, who cares about the largesse at the top? The answers are, first, millions of ordinary Americans in fact will be worse off — as the Tax Policy Center’s preliminary analysis makes clear.  And second, we all have a vital interest in the financial stability of the United States. The tax framework will produce a multitrillion-dollar increase in our deficits by forgoing tax revenues in order to cut taxes on the very must affluent. This spurt in deficits will impede, not accelerate, growth, by increasing the interest rates paid by US businesses. It also will make our ability to respond to the next recession that much more precarious. So, yes, in this case, all of us have a vital interest in not giving away the store to some of us.  To paraphrase Fitzgerald, the ownership of business capital and business capital income is what distinguishes the rich from you and me, and for this reason, the lion’s share of the Trump framework’s multitrillion-dollar business tax cuts cannot help but be captured by the most affluent Americans.

1385,2994,11,4,2017,2017-11-04,Breitbart,"Bannon: Trump, Stewart Voters Going to Win Virginia Governorship for ‘Bush Guy’ Gillespie","Following headliner Stephen K. Bannon, executive chairman of Breitbart News, populist-nationalist 2018 U.S. Senate candidate Corey Stewart addressed the Remembrance Project National Conference in Washington, DC, Saturday.  The event, at the capital’s famous Willard Hotel, featured a “who’s who” of leaders in the fight against illegal immigration, including headliner Bannon, Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton, and Colorado gubernatorial candidate Tom Tancredo, in Remembrance Project’s largest annual event to honor Americans killed by illegal alien crime and the “angel families” they left behind.  Stewart, speaking afterwards with Breitbart News, called Bannon “the most powerful political figure in the United States today.” He agreed with Bannon’s assessment of the political winds in the country. “There’s momentum in the country to destroy political correctness, to do something about illegal immigration, to build the wall, and enforce immigration laws,” he said.  Virginia gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie made “Mara Salvatrucha,” or MS-13, a focal point of his campaign as Tuesday’s election draws near. Fueled by illegal aliens, the transnational criminal gang has become a gruesome feature of the once placid Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, DC.  The issue, that has come to define the race in the last month, is no news to Stewart, who extensively raised the alarm on MS-13 and the refusal of Gillespie opponent Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam to endorse banning the “sanctuary city” policies that fuel transnational criminal organizations in other states in his primary campaign.  Just Thursday, the Department of Justice unveiled indictments for murder against four more alleged MS-13 members from Anne Arundel County, Maryland, just over the state line from the Northern Virginia communities, about which both Gillespie and Stewart have raised concerns.  “MS-13 is not just a Northern Virginia problem. It’s not just in Northern Virginia and tidewater,” Stewart told Breitbart News on Saturday. “It is spreading down the [Interstate] 81 corridor and is becoming a statewide issue … It’s an issue that will drive not only conservatives but independent voters who are concerned about it.”  Stewart, who lost to Ed Gillespie by the narrowest of margin’s in June’s GOP primary, thought his one-time opponent has done well for himself by making illegal immigration-fueled crime the central issue of his campaign. “As he’s moved to the right,” Stewart told Breitbart News of Gillespie, “as he’s embraced the issues of protecting historical monuments and cracking down on illegal immigration, I don’t think it’s a coincidence his poll numbers have improved dramatically.”  The left, including the incumbent Democrat, arch-Clinton ally Terry McAuliffe, has tried to shame Gillespie’s populist turn as “racist.” Most prominent is the response of leftist PAC “Latino Victory Fund,” placing in circulation an ad showing a Gillespie supporter with a confederate flag on his pickup trying to run down Muslim and Latino children. The ad, now conclusively linked to the Northam campaign, has been called “vile” and “despicable” by the Washington Post editorial board.  Corey Stewart called the ad “by far the dumbest move by the left in the last year.”  Bannon, in his own address, broadly agreed with Stewart’s understanding of the path of the Virginia governor’s race. When he mentioned Gillespie’s name, cheers of “Corey! Corey!” erupted from the crowed. “For the Senate in ’18,” was Bannon’s reply.  “That’s a horse race now,” Bannon said. “Gillespie, what was he? Eight, ten points down two weeks ago, two and a half weeks ago?”  Gillespie is now running even or ahead in many polls.  “If Gillespie … a Bush guy … wins, and I do believe that Gillespie’s going to pull this thing out,” Bannon continued, “it will be because of the underlying message of Corey Stewart and what he believes in, and the Trump voters in Virginia who are gonna turn out!”  Stewart was similarly optimistic about the effect of the momentum Gillespie has stirred up with his embrace of Virginia’s populist energy. “A Gillespie win or a narrow loss means there will be a lot more national money and resources going into Virginia in 2018,” he told Breitbart News.",2.3333333333333335,3,"[3.5, 3.0, 0.5]"
1393,3002,11,4,2017,2017-11-04,Fox News,DNC gave Clinton control over campaign well before it was supposed to: docs,"The 2015 deal between Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee in which the group effectively ceded immediate control to the Clinton campaign was supposed to take effect only if Clinton won the primary process - but in effect, they gave her control well before that, according to a copy of the agreement published this weekend.  The publishing of the agreement this weekend follows former DNC interim Chairwoman Donna Brazile’s bombshell accusation Thursday that the party’s 2016 presidential primary contest between Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders was rigged by the DNC to hand the nomination to Clinton.  Brazile, also a onetime Clinton confidante and CNN commentator, made the claims in an article in Politico while touting a new book.  The agreement, in the form of a memo obtained by NBC News, shows the DNC gave the Clinton campaign input on hiring and spending decisions in exchange for money to help the cash-strapped group, including an initial $1.2 million payment.  Hillary for America “personnel will be consulted and have joint authority over strategic decisions over the staffing, budget, expenditures, and general election related communications, data, technology, analytics, and research,"" the Aug. 26, 2015, memorandum from campaign manager Robby Mook to DNC chief executive Amy Dacey states in part. “This does not include any communications related to primary debates -- which will exclusively be controlled by the DNC.”  Clinton didn’t effectively secure the party nomination until July 2016, after an unexpectedly strong challenge from Sanders, an Independent who temporarily joined the Democratic Party to run for the White House.  The memorandum also attempts to argue that nothing in the joint-fundraising agreement “shall be construed to violate the DNC’s obligation of impartiality and neutrality through the nominating process” and acknowledges the group “may enter into similar agreements with other candidates.”  President Trump and other Republicans immediately seized on the book excerpts to validate their belief that Clinton had stolen the election from Sanders. In addition, Trump has suggested the FBI and Justice Department look into the matter.  “I know Donald Trump and Republicans would like to use Hillary Clinton as a whipping boy,” Liz Smith, who was a spokeswoman for Martin O’Malley, another 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, on Saturday told Fox News’ “America’s News Headquarters.” But she’s in our past. We are moving beyond her.”  Smith also said new DNC Chairman Tom Perez has acknowledged problems with the 2016 campaign and has vowed to fix them.  Trump tweeted Friday: “The real story on Collusion is in Donna B's new book. Crooked Hillary bought the DNC & then stole the Democratic Primary from Crazy Bernie!,” “I always felt I would be running and winning against Bernie Sanders, not Crooked H, without cheating, I was right.”  Brazile fired back on Twitter.  ""Today’s lesson: Being quoted by Donald Trump means being MIS-quoted by Donald Trump. Stop trolling me,"" she tweeted with the hashtag #NeverSaidHillaryRiggedElection:  She also tweeted: ""Mr President, please -- go back to attacking me. It’s better than having my own words scrambled and spewed out by you.""

Biden Jr. after Mrs. Clinton suffered a fainting spell, according to an account published Saturday by The Washington Post.  In her book, Ms. Brazile writes of her frequent frustrations with the Clinton campaign, saying that she would tell its leaders that she could invoke powers from the D.N.C. charter to oversee the process of replacing a nominee if she were to become disabled, something that has never happened in the modern era of presidential elections.  The Post quotes Ms. Brazile as writing, “Again and again I thought about Joe Biden,” adding that “no matter my doubts and my fears about the election and Hillary as a candidate, I could not make good on that threat to replace her.” The Post reported that Ms. Brazile had considered replacing Mrs. Clinton after she briefly collapsed in New York City following a Sept. 11 commemoration ceremony.

1391,3000,11,4,2017,2017-11-04,Fox News,Protecting your bank account in the wake of data breaches,"The name “Equifax” now sends shivers down our spines. The company we trusted to handle our credit scores has become a pariah of the financial world since it allowed hackers to steal vital information from 145 million American adults.  I’m one of them. You probably are too. Click here to check if your personal data was exposed in the Equifax data breach.  How much information was stolen? Let’s start with the basics: Your name, Social Security number and birthdate. That alone is a treasure trove for identity thieves. But they also may have your address and driver’s license number. These people know where you live. They can find out almost anything about you. The list of nefarious things they can do is beyond comprehension.  An example? Click here to learn how the Equifax breach lets ID thieves have surgery on your dime.  Here’s my best advice: Assume the worst. The hackers have your information, and Equifax can’t do anything to protect you. Law enforcement is too overwhelmed to find the culprits, and you are completely exposed.  Here’s what to do next.  Establish two-factor authentication  If you work at a modern business or organization, you’re probably familiar with this process already. Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra verification step to the login process of your most critical accounts. When a website asks for your user name and password, you may also receive a text message or an email with a special code. This is a standard practice and is considered safe.  The idea is that even though hackers may have figured out your credentials, they won't be able to access your account without the special code. Cybercriminals would have to nab your physical cellphone, which is probably protected by a passcode, as well. Using this system makes the task much too complicated, especially when many hackers are located in other countries.  Who allows 2FA?  Several websites and email providers already offer 2FA to help protect accounts. The problem is that these sites and providers don’t seem to promote these extra security measures. It’s up to users to figure it out.  Use Amazon, Google or Facebook? How about Apple or Microsoft? All offer 2FA protection, but only if you take a few minutes to set it up. Click here for the steps you need to take now to lock down your accounts.  But what about banks? Incredibly, not all banks support two-factor authentication. Given recent events, I expect this to change. In the meantime, you’ll have to check and see if your online banking permits 2FA. If it does, sign up for it right away.  You can usually set up two-factor authentication either on your online banking account page or within the bank’s official app. Here are the links to some of the more popular banks or financial institutions' two-factor authentication setup pages:  ? Bank of America  ? Capital One  ? Discover  ? USAA  ? Wells Fargo  If your bank is not on the list, call or visit it.  Prevent identity theft  OK, you’ve done your best to secure your accounts and made it hard for hackers to break into your bank or email. But remember, the Equifax hack happened last spring. Cybercriminals have had plenty of time to steal your identity. So what can you do to keep them from finishing the job?  Try executing a “credit freeze,” more accurately known as a “security freeze.” The name may sound strange, almost like sabotaging your own finances, but it’s a common defensive maneuver. If you suspect someone is already pretending to be you, you can lock your credit reports so that no one can open a new account in your name.  How does this work? Lenders consult your credit score before they start a partnership with you. If lenders can’t check those scores, no new accounts can be established.  Click here to learn more about how to set up a security freeze.  The most important thing is not to wait. Hackers move quickly, and this is their fulltime job. If they can steal your identity and bank account, they will, and as expediently as possible. Equifax made one of the biggest blunders in banking history. Now it’s up to us to clean up the mess.

1389,2998,11,4,2017,2017-11-04,The New York Times,Opinion | Obamacare vs. the Saboteurs,"Despite the best efforts of the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress to destroy the Affordable Care Act, the law is not collapsing. And on Wednesday, Americans began signing up for health insurance policies for next year through the online exchanges created by that law.  President Trump’s attempts at sabotage have clearly taken a toll on the A.C.A., or Obamacare. Experts say it is likely that one million to two million fewer people will choose health plans for 2018, compared with 2017. That’s because the administration has reduced the open enrollment period by half, to 45 days. And it has slashed spending on advertising and on health care navigators who help people sign up for insurance plans.  Further, Mr. Trump has said Obamacare is “finished,” “dead” and “gone” — and his words appear to be having an impact. A recent poll found that a sizable minority of voters think the law has been repealed. Others are unaware of when open enrollment started (Nov. 1) and when it will end (Dec. 15 for much of the country). The president’s remarks and actions have also scared insurance companies into raising premiums — by about 37 percent for popular “silver” plans, and by smaller amounts for the “bronze” and “gold” plans — because the administration is cutting payments to insurers, and the companies are expecting fewer healthy people to buy coverage.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File)  TOKYO (AP) — President Donald Trump can expect a friendly reception in Japan, his first stop on a five-nation Asia trip that kicks off Sunday.  He and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe largely see eye-to-eye on how to deal with the vexing problem of North Korea’s weapons development, even if a solution remains elusive. America’s trade deficit with Japan could be a point of contention, though Trump has aimed his recent rhetoric on trade at China, not Japan.  The two leaders will meet on the golf course Sunday before holding formal talks on Monday. A look at what’s on tap:  NORTH KOREA  North Korea’s rapid advances in missile development are making the potential threat much more real for both Japan and the United States. As it seeks to send missiles farther, North Korea has test-launched two over northern Japan and into the Pacific Ocean this year. While they were too high to be seen or heard on the ground, the Japanese government set off emergency sirens and warnings advising people to seek shelter. Abe has pushed for stronger U.N. sanctions on North Korea, and joined Trump in saying China should do more to pressure its neighbor. Trump and Abe are likely to agree that what is needed is more pressure, not dialogue, as they have in the past.  ___  TRADE  One of Trump’s first moves as president was to pull the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement that had been signed with 11 other countries after years of tough negotiations. While widely anticipated, it was a blow to Japan and the other TPP members. In line with Trump’s preference for country-to-country trade deals, Vice President Mike Pence and Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Taro Aso have been leading an “economic dialogue” aimed at forging closer ties. Japan’s trade surplus with the U.S. is much smaller than China’s, and Japanese automakers, especially, have sought to mute criticism by setting up shop in the U.S. and hiring American workers. But Trump has complained about a weakening of the yen over the past five years that has aided Japanese exporters and other corporations with significant business overseas.  ___  ABDUCTIONS  Trump’s address to the U.N. General Assembly in September, in which he warned the U.S. might have “to totally destroy North Korea,” got attention in Japan for another reason. “We know it kidnapped a sweet 13-year-old Japanese girl from a beach in her own country to enslave her as a language tutor for North Korea’s spies,” he said. In so doing, Trump touched on an issue that Abe has made a priority to resolve: the Japanese citizens who were abducted by North Korea in the 1970s and 1980s. Five returned in 2002, but the fate of the others remains unclear. Trump plans to meet with the relatives of some of the abductees while he is in Japan.  ___  FORE!  Golf diplomacy has become part of Japan’s playbook on Donald Trump. Abe made a stopover in New York soon after the U.S. presidential election last November and presented the then-president-elect with a pricey Japanese Honma driver. Trump reciprocated with a golf shirt and other golf-related goods. The two hit the links at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida after a summit meeting in Washington in February. They will be joined by top Japanese pro Hideki Matsuyama on Sunday at the Kasumigaseki Country Club outside of Tokyo. The prestigious club changed its policy to allow women to be full members in March after coming under pressure as the venue for golf at the Summer Olympics in Tokyo in 2020.

(AP Photo/Michael Probst,file)  BERLIN (AP) — Climate change is back on the agenda with a global climate conference kicking off Monday in the German city of Bonn.  Who’s coming, what are the key debates about and how green will this meeting be? Five things to know about the U.N. conference known as COP23, which runs from Nov. 6-17.  ____  WHO IS COMING TO BONN?  Up to 25,000 people are expected to attend the talks, which will be presided over by Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama of Fiji — the first time that a small island nation will be at the helm of a major international climate conference. Participants will include diplomats from 195 nations, as well as scientists, lobbyists and environmentalists.  The United States, which has announced its intention to pull out of the landmark Paris climate accord, will be represented by Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Thomas Shannon.  Key countries to watch during the talks are the emerging economic powers China and India. Other nations — Estonia, Peru, Ecuador, Iran, Mali, Ethiopia and the Maldives — will also be in the spotlight for leading major international groupings.  French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other leaders are expected to fly to Bonn toward the end of the summit to give the talks a final push and signal their commitment to fighting climate change.  ___  WHAT ARE THE BIG CLIMATE CHANGE TOPICS NOW?  The 2015 Paris accord set a target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) — or 2 degrees at the most — by the end of the century.  But diplomats didn’t agree on the details of how their nations will reach that ambitious goal. The Bonn talks will flesh out the rule book that countries have to abide by.  This includes coming up with international standards for how to measure carbon emissions, to make sure that one nation’s efforts can be compare to another’s. A second debate centers around how countries take stock of what’s been achieved and set new, more ambitious goals for curbing carbon emissions after 2020.  The third big issue concerns money. Experts agree that shifting economies away from fossil fuels and preparing countries for some of the inevitable consequences of climate change will require vast financial resources — including some from the U.S. administration of President Donald Trump, which is doubtful about man-made climate change.  ___  WHY BONN?  Organizing a massive global conference in Fiji would have strained the Pacific nation’s resources and posed a travel nightmare for thousands of delegates. Germany offered to host the talks in Bonn, the country’s former capital, because it has ample conference space and is already home to the U.N. climate change agency.  Still, they are going to miss the sunshine of Fiji. The weather in Bonn is generally dreary at best in November.  ___  HOW GREEN WILL THE CONFERENCE BE?  Germany says the two-week talks will as environmentally friendly as possible. The country is setting aside part of the 117 million euro ($136.3 million) budget for a fleet of bicycles and electric buses to ferry people between venues.  Each participant will receive a bottle to fill with tap water — a move organizers say will save half a million plastic cups.  Germany’s environment ministry is also investing in renewable energy projects to compensate for the greenhouse gas emissions caused by people from all over the world flying into Bonn for the talks.  ___  AND WHAT ABOUT GERMANY’S COAL USAGE?  Germany likes to portray itself as a leader in the fight against global warming and Merkel’s reputation as the “climate chancellor” is partly built on the pivotal role she played during past negotiations.  But environmentalists note that Germany still gets about 40 percent of its electricity from coal-fired plants — one of the most carbon intensive sources of energy. And German highways are also virtually unique in having no general speed limit, despite the fact that auto emissions rise dramatically at higher speeds.  If prosperous Germany fails to meet its own emissions targets, as current predictions suggest, critics say that would send a bad signal to the rest of the world.",4.083333333333333,6,"[4.5, 4.5, 2.5, 3.0, 5.0, 5.0]"

Trump is on a five country trip through Asia traveling to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)  FUSSA, Japan (AP) — President Donald Trump praised Japan as a “crucial ally” and warned adversaries not to test America’s resolve Sunday as he opened a grueling and consequential first trip to Asia.  Trump landed at Yokota Air Base on the outskirts of Tokyo and was greeted by cheering service members. Trump then donned a bomber jacket for a speech in which he touted American firepower and the U.S. alliance with Japan.  “Japan is a treasured partner and crucial ally of the United States and today we thank them for welcoming us and for decades of wonderful friendship between our two nations,” he said, speaking in front of an American flag inside an airplane hangar.  Trump was expected to spend much of his 12-day, five-country Asian tour exhorting allies and rivals to step up efforts to counter the dangers posed by North Korea, which continues to move forward with its nuclear weapons program. Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have been engaged in an escalating war of words, with Trump repeatedly referring to Un as “Little Rocket Man” and threatening in a recent speech to “totally destroy” the nation, if necessary.  Even before he landed, Trump used the first moments of the trip to denounce the North as “a big problem” that must “be solved.”  President Donald Trump and the first lady departed Hawaii for Japan, the first stop on his 12-day trip to Asia, where he will exhort allies and rivals on the need to counter the dangers posed by North Korea's nuclear threat. (Nov. 4)  “There’s been 25 years of total weakness, so we are taking a very much different approach” toward the North, he told reporters traveling with him.  During the speech, Trump did not mention North Korea by name, but warned of the consequences of crossing what he called the “most fearsome fighting force in the history of our world.”  “Together with our allies, America’s warriors are prepared to defend our nation using the full range of our unmatched capabilities. No one — no dictator, no regime and no nation — should underestimate, ever, American resolve,” Trump told the troops.  Some regional analysts have speculated that Trump’s presence in Asia may prompt North Korea to take provocative action, like another missile test. Trump, when asked about that possibility aboard Air Force One, said “we’ll soon find out.”  After the speech, Trump flew by helicopter to the Kasumigaseki Country Club about 20 miles outside of Tokyo for lunch and a round of golf with Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Japanese golfer Hideki Matsuyama. An avid golfer, Trump said Matsuyama is “probably the greatest player in the history of Japan.”  Trump and Abe have struck up a personal friendship, forged through multiple meetings and telephone conversations, as well as on the greens of one of Trump’s Florida golf clubs and over intimate dinners at Trump’s Florida estate.  At the club, the leaders signed white caps inscribed with the phrase, “Donald and Shinzo: Make Alliance Even Greater,” a tribute to the U.S.-Japan friendship and a play on Trump’s campaign slogan. On the menu: a hamburger made from U.S. beef.  The trip, which marks the longest Far East itinerary for a president in a generation, comes at a precarious moment for Trump. Days ago, his former campaign chairman was indicted and another adviser pleaded guilty as part of an investigation into possible collusion between Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russian officials.  The journey will also test Trump’s stamina. But the 71-year-old president assured reporters that he was up for the task. “It’s grueling, they tell me, but fortunately that’s historically not been a problem for me. One thing you people will say, that’s not been a problem,” he said.  The visit will be closely watched by Asian allies worried that Trump’s inward-looking “America First” agenda could cede power in the region to China. They also are rattled by his bellicose rhetoric toward North Korea. The North’s growing missile arsenal threatens several of the capitals Trump will visit.  The trip will also put Trump in face-to-face meetings with authoritarian leaders for whom he has expressed admiration. They include China’s Xi Jinping, whom Trump has likened to “a king,” and the Philippines’ Rodrigo Duterte, who has sanctioned the extrajudicial killings of drug dealers.  Trump is also expected to have a second private audience with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of a summit in Vietnam. Trump told reporters he “will want Putin’s help” in dealing with North Korea. They previously met during a summit in Europe this summer.  The White House has signaled that Trump will push American economic interests in the region, but the North Korea issue is expected to dominate the trip. One of Trump’s two major speeches will come before the National Assembly in Seoul. But fiery threats against the North could resonate differently than they do from the distance of Washington.  Trump will forgo a trip to the Demilitarized Zone, the stark border between North and South Korea. All U.S. presidents except one since Ronald Reagan have visited the DMZ in a sign of solidarity with Seoul. The White House contends that Trump’s commitment to South Korea is already crystal clear, as evidenced by his war of words with Kim and his threats to deliver “fire and fury” to North Korea if it does not stop threatening American allies.  The escalation of rhetoric, a departure from the conduct of past presidents, has undermined confidence in the U.S. as a stabilizing presence in Asia.  “There’s a danger if there is a lot of muscle flexing,” said Mike Chinoy, a senior fellow at the U.S.-China Institute at the University of Southern California. “Trump has been going right up to the edge and I wouldn’t rule out some sort of forceful North Korean reaction to Trump’s presence in the region,” he said.  The White House said Trump would be undeterred.  “The president will use whatever language he wants to use, obviously,” White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster told reporters before Trump departed Washington. “I don’t think the president really modulates his language, have you noticed?”  ___  Colvin reported from Tokyo.

He wrote: “Playing golf with Prime Minister Abe and Hideki Matsuyama, two wonderful people!”  Abe also chimed in on Twitter. He said: “A round of golf with a marvelous friend (President Donald J. Trump), full of spirited conversation.”  Trump and Abe will have dinner tonight with their wives.  ___  2:45 p.m.  U.S. first lady Melania Trump and her Japanese counterpart, Akie Abe, visited a pearl boutique in Tokyo’s posh Ginza shopping district while their husbands played golf.  The first ladies received a presentation on the history of pearl diving at Mikimoto, Japan’s top pearl jewelry maker.  A pair of female pearl divers showed up at the store, dressed in white diving suits and goggles.  Women have traditionally played a key role in Japan as pearl divers, known as “ama” or ocean woman.  Several hundred people showed up outside the store to take photos of the first ladies’ motorcade.  Trump's first official visit to the Asia will be extended by another day to attend the East Asian Summit. Speaking to reporters, the president predicted a ""successful"" trip. He also dismissed knowing ex-staffer George Papadopoulos well.

As they entered the dining room, Trump and Abe signed a white hat that said: “Donald and Shinzo: Make Alliance Even Greater.” It was a tribute to the U.S.-Japan friendship and a play on Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan.  ___  12:05 p.m.  President Donald Trump says the U.S.-Japan alliance is a testament to the “transformative power of freedom.”  He observes that two countries that once waged war are now friends and partners in pursuit of a better world. That was an oblique reference to joint efforts by Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to pressure North Korea to give up its pursuit of nuclear weapons.  Trump addressed service members at Yokota Air Base near Tokyo after arriving in Japan, the first leg of his five-nation tour of Asia.  Japan’s surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, drew the U.S. to enter World War II.

The group, founded by Revolutionary Communist Party chairman Bob Avakian, took out a full-page ad in the New York Times to promote the rally, and has enjoyed free press in the national media in the past few days.  Despite the press attention, turnout was low at many of Refuse Fascism’s rallies, which were scheduled to take place in 20 U.S. cities.

The children have no rights as children; the parents have no rights as parents.”  Dr. Minuchin said it made no sense to blame parents for their children’s psychosomatic disorders.  “There’s no perfect family; it’s a myth,” he said. “One set of circumstances might lead to an anorexic child, another to a depressive. Perfect parenting is an impossible thing, like being a perfect president or something like that. It’s trying to do good through a series of mistakes. It’s part of the human condition.  “No one,” he added, “knows how to do it right.”  Dr. Minuchin, a son of Jewish immigrants from Russia, was born on Oct. 13, 1921, in San Salvador, Argentina, north of Buenos Aires. His father, Mauricio, owned a small store and, after it failed during the Depression, herded horses. His mother was the former Clara Tolachier.  Salvador Minuchin was inspired to help young delinquents after a high school teacher, quoting the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, described them as victims of society. He later became active in leftist protests opposing the military government’s seizure of Argentine universities and was jailed for several months.  After earning a medical degree from the National University of Córdoba in Argentina, he enlisted in the Israeli Army during the 1948 war for independence.  Dr. Minuchin studied child psychiatry in the United States with Dr. Nathan Ackerman, who later established what is now the Ackerman Institute for the Family in Manhattan. He returned to Israel to treat Holocaust orphans and children displaced by wars, then came back to New York to train in psychoanalysis at the William Alanson White Institute.  He went on to work as a child psychiatrist at the Wiltwyck School for delinquent boys in the Hudson Valley, where he developed his theory of what became known as structural family therapy. He recounted his experiences with several co-authors in “Families of the Slums” (1967).",4.285714285714286,7,"[4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0]"

The two companies have been dancing around a possible merger for years, and were again in the news in recent weeks with talks of the two companies coming together after all. But in a joint statement Saturday, Sprint and T-Mobile said they are calling off merger negotiations for the foreseeable future.  “The prospect of combining with Sprint has been compelling for a variety of reasons, including the potential to create significant benefits for consumers and value for shareholders. However, we have been clear all along that a deal with anyone will have to result in superior long-term value for T-Mobile’s shareholders compared to our outstanding stand-alone performance and track record,” said John Legere, president and CEO of T-Mobile US, in a prepared statement.  T-Mobile and Sprint are the U.S.′ third- and fourth-largest wireless carriers, respectively, but they are significantly smaller than AT&T and Verizon, who effectively have a duopoly over U.S. wireless service. The two companies have said they hoped to find a way of merging to make the wireless market more competitive.  Sprint and its owner, the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, have long been looking for a deal as the company has struggled to compete on its own. But Washington regulators have frowned on a possible merger. D.C. spiked AT&T’s offer to buy T-Mobile in 2011 and signaled in 2014 they would have been against Sprint doing the same thing. But with the new Trump administration, it was thought regulators might be more relaxed about a merger.  Sprint has a lot of debt and has posted a string of annual losses. The company has cut costs and made itself more attractive to customers, BTIG Research analyst Walter Piecyk says, but it hasn’t invested enough in its network and doesn’t have enough airwave rights for quality service in rural areas.  T-Mobile, meanwhile, has been on a yearslong streak adding customers. After the government nixed AT&T’s attempt to buy it in 2011, T-Mobile led the way in many consumer-friendly changes, such as ditching two-year contracts and bringing back unlimited data plans. Consumers are paying less for cellphone service, thanks to T-Mobile’s influence on the industry and the resultant price wars.  “T-Mobile does not need a merger with Sprint to succeed, but Sprint might need one to survive,” Piecyk wrote in an October research note.",3.5555555555555554,18,"[2.5, 2.5, 4.5, 4.0, 5.0, 3.5, 3.0, 4.0, 2.5, 1.0, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5]"

She’s definitely not holding back in her scathing review of the Clinton operation during 2016. She says she felt like a slave and felt disrespected by the Clinton campaign members. What’s the most interesting is that she had two people in mind when she was discussing replacing Hillary after the fainting spell on 9/11. She says she just couldn’t do it because she didn’t want to let women down…LOL! Sure!  SECRET DELIBERATIONS…  Trending: AMERICA’S BIGGEST LOSER Explains Why Multiple Sexual Assault Claims Against Bill Clinton Are Not As Serious As Kavanaugh’s…Calls For CIVIL WAR! [VIDEO]  Donna Brazile held secret deliberations to discuss using her power as interim chair of the Democratic National Committee to replace Hillary Clinton as the party’s nominee after the former first lady suffered a fainting spell on the campaign trail last September, she writes in her bombshell memoir.    Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court? Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?  Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court? * Yes, he will be confirmed. No, he will not be confirmed.        The Washington Post reports that Brazile reveals in her memoir that she considered replacing Clinton with then-Vice President Joe Biden or New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker because of the former secretary of state’s “anemic” campaign.  JOE BIDEN…THE GROPER  Clinton’s effort, which carried with it an “odor of failure,” was struggling to appeal to white working-class voters, writes Brazile in the book, “Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns That Put Donald Trump in the White House.”  The Post obtained an advance copy of the 288-page memoir, which will be released on Tuesday.  REMEMBER THIS?  Clinton fainted on Sept. 11, 2016 at an event in New York City. She was later diagnosed with pneumonia and spent several days away from the campaign trail. Video of her fainting spell went viral and was cited by conservatives as evidence that the former secretary of state was too frail to carry out the duties of president.  Brazile, a longtime Democratic consultant who managed Al Gore’s 2000 White House bid, says that she first became concerned about Clinton’s health on Sept. 9, following an event in Manhattan.  Brazile said that Clinton appeared “wobbly on her feet” with a “rattled cough,” according to The Post.  As acting chairwoman of the DNC, Brazile had the power to replace the party’s nominee if they became disabled. Brazile reminded the Clinton campaign of that authority, which was included in the DNC charter.  Clinton’s fainting spell triggered talk inside Democratic circles that Brazile could exercise that authority. She said that Biden’s chief of staff contacted her a day after Clinton passed out.  “Gee, I wonder what he wanted to talk to me about?” she said to herself, she recalls in her book.  Brazile writes that she heavily considered appointing Biden but could not pull the trigger to replace the first female nominee for president.  “Again and again I thought about Joe Biden,” Brazile writes, according to The Post.  “No matter my doubts and my fears about the election and Hillary as a candidate, I could not make good on that threat to replace her.”  “I thought of Hillary, and all the women in the country who were so proud of and excited about her. I could not do this to them.”  “I FELT LIKE A SLAVE”  As one of her party’s most prominent black strategists, Brazile also recounts fiery disagreements with Clinton’s staffers — including a conference call in which she told three senior campaign officials, Charlie Baker, Marlon Marshall and Dennis Cheng, that she was being treated like a slave.  “I’m not Patsey the slave,” Brazile recalls telling them, a reference to the character played by Lupita Nyong’o in the film, “12 Years a Slave.” “Y’all keep whipping me and whipping me and you never give me any money or any way to do my damn job.

The social media site said that the account was taken down by a customer support employee during their last day with the company.  “Amazing. That this could happen to a President's account demonstrates Twitter has poor insider threat controls and indicators,” tweeted Micah Zenko, a foreign policy and national security analyst at international affairs institute Chatham House.  WHAT TWITTER'S 280-CHARACTER LIMIT COULD MEAN FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP AND US POLITICS  Matt Tait, a senior cybersecurity fellow at the Robert Strauss Center, tweeted a series of satirical comments on the incident but warned that the employee involved could be in legal hot water.  “What if someone had hijacked the President's Twitter and issued policies for DHS or DOD that the department wasn't aware it had to implement?,” he tweeted.  “What if the Twitter employee had tweeted about some ongoing terror case and jeopardized it?,” he wrote, in another tweet.  TRUMP MAKE FIRST TWEETS AS PRESIDENT  “What if the Twitter employee tweeted a video of him assaulting a media organization or a political opponent? Imagine the damage to the dignity of the office,” Tait tweeted.  Tait also suggested that the rogue employee could face charges under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). “Going to be boring and say the Twitter employee who deleted Trump for 11 minutes should get an attorney and get ready for CFAA charges,” he tweeted.  Technologies such as artifical intelligence are being touted as a way for companies to gain visibility into their employees working practices. Questions will also inevitably be asked about Twitter’s employee vetting processes.  TRUMP'S TWITTER: COULD HACKERS WREAK HAVOC FROM THE WHITE HOUSE?  Twitter says that it is conducting a “full internal review” into the deactivation of the President’s Twitter account. When contacted by Fox News, Twitter declined to comment beyond its initial tweets.  The President himself addressed the situation early Friday. “My Twitter account was taken down for 11 minutes by a rogue employee. I guess the word must finally be getting out-and having an impact,” he tweeted.  Trump, who has more than 41 million followers on Twitter, turned his @realDonaldTrump account into a powerful political weapon during his run to the White House. Experts, however, have warned that hackers could potentially use the same account to wreak havoc.  JAMES COMEY'S 'SECRET' TWITTER ACCOUNT REVEALED  Trump’s Twitter account has already been hacked, albeit briefly, in 2013, when an unknown attacker tweeted out an offensive lyric by rapper Lil’ Wayne.

1387,2996,11,4,2017,2017-11-04,The New York Times,Opinion | Everything Is Bad. Blame the Tax Code.,"All of that means that when it comes time for Republicans to make good on their years of promises about tax reform, they freeze up. Because they like being able to manipulate people, institutions and industries via the tax code.  This is not entirely Donald Trump’s fault (for once). The Republican Party’s allergy to closing loopholes predates his presidency. Since 1986 — the last serious, successful effort to simplify the tax code — being a signatory to Grover Norquist’s Taxpayer Protection Pledge has been the cost of admission into civilized Republican society. The pledge binds signatories to oppose all increases in marginal income tax rates for individuals and businesses. It also requires that they oppose the elimination of deductions and other loopholes unless increased revenue is offset by reductions elsewhere. What the pledge very carefully does not ask signatories to do is to cut spending.  In other words, nearly all Republican members of Congress have signed a deal that makes it politically unappealing (though not impossible) to eliminate loopholes. It allows them to wear the badge of fiscal conservatism without cutting spending. At the end of all those decades of distortion: the new Republican tax plan, with its cuts in the corporate tax rate, an increase of the standard deduction, some fiddling with income tax rates in different brackets and absolutely nothing in the way of simplification, rationalization or believable revenue neutrality.  Rumor has it that Mr. Trump felt pretty strongly about naming the bill the Cut Cut Cut Act. This is consistent with the fiscal plank of nearly every Republican primary contender, best summed up as “cut taxes first, ask questions later.” In fact, the bill is called the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but the sentiment is there.  There are quite a few Republicans who have made no secret of the fact that they’re holding their noses and working with Mr. Trump in order to get tax reform. The House speaker, Paul Ryan, as sincere a fiscal reformer as one can hope to see in leadership, was described as saying last week that he and the House Ways and Means Committee were “turning the dials” on the plan. By strategically phasing out certain provisions and plugging in optimistic growth estimates, the Republicans might get the math to work on paper. But in reality, no one seemed to know where the offsetting hundreds of billions in revenue will come from, and for every door the plan closes, it opens a window.  Everyone lies to the tax man, knowingly or unknowingly. That’s why howling for the president’s tax returns is an ever-present background noise in the nation’s capital: Reporters know there are likely to be exaggerations, bold deductions and envelope-pushing maneuvers aplenty in there, because they’ve done the same on their own returns.  People hate taxes because they hate to be pushed around. But politicians love taxes because it’s their job to push people around, and taxes are a powerful tool to do just that. A “tax return you can fill out on the back of a postcard” — long promised by the Republican Party — would essentially be a decision by the political class to unilaterally disarm itself.

More importantly, to make sure that small businesses, which really are the backbone of new jobs in America–about 75 percent of all new jobs in America are created by small businesses–and we wanted to make sure that this tax bill that comes through affects them because, after all, you are trying to create jobs.”  He also urged listeners to visit the website TaxCutsNow.com and sign the petition. “We’re going to drop it on the front lawn of the Capitol to try to stimulate everybody to support a tax bill which we think is critically important today.”  Marcus said, “We’re losing a tremendous amount of jobs from overseas, and the small business guy is getting killed.”  He also said while he does not think there can be a “perfect” tax reform bill in this environment, he does believe much can be accomplished through a solid effort if President Trump and Republicans in Congress can get something done. He then warned of electoral catastrophe in 2018 if they do not.  Marcus also pointed out that while the media and people are distracted by the president’s tweets, they are not paying attention to how many regulations he is rolling back, and each of those regulations are job killers.  He urged Democrats to go along with a final plan and blasted Democrat leaders Rep. Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer. “I don’t understand Nancy Pelosi. I don’t understand Schumer,” he said, “They don’t want to see more people hired in America. It’s incredible to me. Nancy Pelosi thinks this is going to cost jobs.

But if Only …,"Donald Trump has not proved himself to be much of a talent scout; as president he has tended to pick far-right zealots, inept toadies, conflicted swamp dwellers and unqualified family members for top jobs. So it is a relief that he picked a levelheaded and competent person to lead the Federal Reserve, whose authority to direct interest rates and supervise banks gives it enormous influence over the economy.  By choosing Jerome Powell, a Republican respected across the political spectrum, Mr. Trump has opted for continuity and stability, rather than disruption and destruction. Mr. Powell has been a solid member of the Fed board since 2012 and has supported its current chairwoman, Janet Yellen, and her predecessor, Ben Bernanke, as they worked to revive the economy.  Mr. Powell appears to share Ms. Yellen’s view that while the economy has improved a lot in recent years, the time is not right for the Fed to raise interest rates rapidly and substantially. He is a far better choice than other candidates Mr. Trump was said to be considering. They included critics of the Fed who claimed in the wake of the 2008 crisis that the central bank was sowing the seeds for out-of-control inflation. (Almost a decade later there is still no sign of that.) Other potential nominees have advocated for the deregulation of banks, which could imperil the financial system.  That said, Mr. Trump would have made a much better decision had he offered Ms. Yellen a second term, in keeping with a tradition in which presidents have reappointed Fed leaders who were seen to be doing a good job, regardless of party affiliation. As Mr. Trump noted himself, Ms. Yellen has done a terrific job during a precarious time. Under her watch, unemployment fell to 4.1 percent last month, from 6.7 percent when she took over in 2014, and inflation has been well below the Fed’s 2 percent target. The agency has also become a more vigilant supervisor of big banks. Of course, we have not always agreed with Ms. Yellen, particularly when the Fed has been overly fearful of inflation.",3.8333333333333335,6,"[5.0, 4.0, 1.5, 3.0, 5.0, 4.5]"
1361,2961,11,3,2017,2017-11-03,Fox News,Trump must act urgently to save the US steel industry -- National security begins with primary steelmaking,"American industry has always been a primary source of strength and jobs in our nation. But today, a great industry that has played a vital role in building and defending the United States – the steel industry – is in crisis.  Surging steel imports, largely subsidized by foreign governments, have hammered prices, forced some steel mills to close, and cost thousands of steelworkers their jobs. Since 2000, more than 60,000 steelworkers have seen their jobs disappear, including 14,000 in 2015 and 2016 alone.  Unfortunately, the import surge continues to grow. Through the first eight months of this year, steel imports have increased by 21 percent compared to the same period last year. And in June, imports of finished steel matched the record level of 30 percent.  Foreign steel producers continue to find every way possible to circumvent trade laws and dump products in our market.  As a result, the U.S. steel industry is making less steel. Output is approximately 22 million tons lower than it was before the recession. While steel mills ideally should be running at above 85 percent of their capacity to maintain economic sustainability, capacity utilization rates since 2009 have been unsustainably low, fluctuating between approximately 70 and 75 percent.  But there is a solution to this crisis. In April, President Trump recognized both the importance of steel to U.S. national security and the crisis facing the industry. He announced that his administration would begin an investigation pursuant to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The law authorizes the secretary of Commerce to conduct investigations to determine what effects imports of any product have on U.S. national security.  Launching the investigation was an important signal that the Trump administration would not tolerate further erosion of the steel industry.  Unfortunately, the steel crisis has only deteriorated further since the investigation was announced. Given the expectations of swift, decisive action, steel imports have flooded the market to avoid the anticipated response. This has siphoned badly needed sales from domestic manufacturers and hurt American workers.  Despite the urgent need for action, reports now are that a decision on trade violations will be delayed until after Congress deals with tax reform.  The U.S. steel industry cannot afford to wait. This is President Trump’s decision; and congressional stalemate should not keep him from doing what’s best for U.S. national defense, economic security and tens of thousands of American steel workers. With each delay, the communities and workers that rely on paychecks, taxes and economic activity created by the steel industry suffer.  Steel is used to build the ships, armored vehicles and weapons that keep our troops safe. It is used to build the roads, bridges, railways and airports that keep our economy running. And the steel industry provides jobs that support steelworkers and their families.  In a time of national crisis, the U.S. cannot afford to rely on foreign steel suppliers like China or Russia. National security begins with primary steelmaking. We need the president to act now.  Soon after our nation’s entry into World War II, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt told Congress: “Powerful enemies must be out-fought and out-produced.” His words are as true today as they were then.  To ensure a strong and prosperous America, we must be able to produce the steel that supports our military, our infrastructure and our communities across the country. Our national security and economic strength comes from making, building, and innovating right here in the United States.

1363,2963,11,3,2017,2017-11-03,Breitbart,"Lawmakers Warn of Iranian Takeover in Iraq, Blame Obama Holdovers","WASHINGTON, DC – A group of Republican lawmakers, veterans, and experts are calling on President Donald Trump to intervene in Iraq to stop a State Department policy that is harming a U.S. ally and allowing Iranian influence to grow.  “This has to get above the State Department. I don’t think President Trump knows what’s going on here,” Marine veteran Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA) said this week at a press conference organized by Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-FL).  “I don’t think he’s seen this picture of his tank as Commander in Chief with a Hezbollah flag on it,” he said, gesturing to one of the poster-sized photos he brought with him of Iranian-backed Shia militias using U.S.-funded equipment in Iraq.  “I don’t think Secretary Mattis has seen this picture of his M1 Abrams tank with a Hezbollah flag on it,” he added. “The State Department knows what’s going on, and it’s time for them to get their heads out of the sand, or for this to be taken out of their hands completely because they’ve screwed up over and over and it’s time that we fix it.”  Iraqi forces and Iranian-backed militias have invaded and taken over areas within Iraqi Kurdistan and threatening more military force if they do not willingly give up areas under their control.  The Iraqi Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), a longtime U.S. ally who helped defeat the Islamic State in Iraq, governs the large Kurdish ethnic minority who live in the semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan in northern Iraq. Last month, the KRG held a non-binding referendum on Kurdish statehood, prompting Baghdad to send its elite counterterrorism forces, backed by Shia militias and armed with U.S.-provided tanks and weapons, to seize infrastructure in Kirkuk under Kurdish control.  The seizure happened without much bloodshed after Baghdad made a deal with local Kurdish officials, but Baghdad is threatening to seize other areas by force, and Kurdish forces, known as the Peshmerga, are vowing to fight back.  Helping to orchestrate Baghdad’s takeover of Kurdish areas are Shia militias known collectively as the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF/PMU), including some who reportedly take their orders from Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Commander Qasem Soleimani.  The U.S.’s position is not to take sides and urge both parties to talk, but lawmakers warn that unless the Trump administration does something, Iran will continue to grow its influence inside Iran to the detriment of U.S. allies in the region.  “The United States should be standing with our Kurdish allies, particularly at this hour of threat that they’re facing from Iranian-backed forces over in Iraq,” said DeSantis, an Iraq War Army veteran.  He added:  If the Kurds are pushed back, Iran continues to dominate Iraq, and they can dominate the Sunni Arabs in Western Iraq, you’re going to have a land bridge from Iran all the way into Syria, right on Israel’s doorstep, that is going to be an absolute disaster for our security interests and for our allies’ security interests.  “The main source of casualties for American troops were people like Qasem Soleimani, the Quds Force, and Shia militia,” he said. “So what you have now is a faithful ally, the Kurds, who have been with America for a long time and has fought alongside with America, [about to be attacked by] Iranian-backed forces who have American blood on their hands.”  “The kicker is that they are launching attacks against the Kurds or preparing to do so with American weapons. We cannot let this happen,” he said.  Retired Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bartlett, who was severely injured by Iranian-provided weapons in Iraq, questioned, “Why is our money going to a regime that killed Americans?”  Rep. Trent Franks (R-AZ) reminded Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi that he promised not to attack the Kurds: “He made that promise weeks ago. And for him to break his word before the whole world does not speak well of his leadership.”  Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY) agreed. “It’s important for al-Abadi to take more leadership over his own government, to reject this Iranian influence, the Iranians can’t help themselves but to meddle all over the Middle East, whether it’s the IRGC activities.”  But Hunter and others put blame squarely on the State Department, which they say is allowing Iran to run roughshod over Baghdad because they do not want to upset Iran.  Sebastian Gorka, former deputy assistant to Trump, said that when he joined the administration, he learned that the same Obama-era officials were running policy in Iraq.  “One of the greatest negative legacies that we inherited in the White House when I came onboard was the absolutely outrageously utopian and unrealistic policy with regards to Iran. Iran is a bad actor, across the whole region from Yemen, to Iraq to Syria,” he said at the press conference.  Hunter pointed the finger squarely at Brett McGurk, who is the U.S.’s envoy to the region on the fight against ISIS.

The move comes after mounting pressure on the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation. Until Friday, the agency said that the board would be given only a staff report summarizing the deal, as is routine when dealing with agency contracts. In a letter to board members Friday, agency chief executive Mark Hogan said the board members will now have access to the contract Monday afternoon. The vote is scheduled for Wednesday.  ""I have said many times this is a complex transaction and it is important to get it done right, both for the company and its investors, as well as WEDC, the state and our taxpayers,"" Hogan wrote. ""Given we are very close on the contract language, and given the size of the award, now is the appropriate time to make it available to you as board members.""  He said the review will happen in closed session and will be confidential. The contract will be made available to the public after it's signed.  Democrats have been calling for the full contract language to be made available. Earlier this week, Republican legislative leaders publicly agreed and also said board members should see the contract before a vote. A vote was delayed in October because of an unexplained problem with the contract language.  The incentive package provides nearly $3 billion in cash to Foxconn if it invests $10 billion in a new flat-screen factory in southeastern Wisconsin and employs 13,000 people. The package already signed by Walker provides $150 million in sales tax exemptions on construction equipment and allows the company to build in wetlands and waterways.  Walker and supporters have heralded the deal as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make the state a hub for the high-tech electronics industry.

The second generation of its autonomous vehicles is being developed on Uber’s test track, an Uber spokeswoman told Fox News.  Uber's self-driving vehicles made their debut in Pittsburgh in 2016 and have been picking up passengers ever since.  Current models require one or two vehicle operators, Uber Hardware Engineer Brian Zajac told Fox News. An Uber employee sits in the driver's seat and is ready to take over the vehicle when the computer system tells the opertator it needs to go off self-driving mode. Another employee sits in the passenger seat monitoring a map that displays what the vehicle's sensors see in real-time, including bikers, pedestrians and other vehicles. Customers can see what the car ""sees"" through an iPad provided in the back seat.  The next generation is a step closer to having no vehicle operators, Zajac said.  “In the far future, there won’t be any vehicle operator,” Zajac said. “The car rolls up, there’s no human inside at all, and the customer gets in and takes a ride.”  Some of the more immediate changes, which will be incorporated into the third generation of autonomous vehicles, are not easily visible.  “From the outside, a lot looks the same, but under the hood, we’ve made a whole bunch of improvements,” Zajac said.  One of those improvements is a higher resolution set of cameras.  “That extra resolution allows the sensors to see a little bit farther which allows the system to drive a little bit faster,” Zajac said.  The cameras will also have a better cleaning system for inclement weather.  “It’s been redesigned to handle heavier rain and to handle other types of contamination that gets on our cameras,” Zajac said.  The camera system will also have fewer parts to assemble, which would make it easier to mass produce in the future.  Current models have limited trunk space that’s shared with computer equipment. The new version will give passengers the full trunk space of the vehicle.  “You’ll see it’s a nice big open trunk that you can throw all of your luggage, jump in the car and go to the airport or wherever you might be headed,” Zajac said.  For now, Uber’s newest release will not change the passenger experience too much, a spokeswoman said.  Zajac said the engineers will keep pushing toward the goal of full autonomy.  “This is kind of uncharted territory for a lot of companies but there’s a lot of really good other industries we can draw from such as aerospace and the automotive industry,” he said.",2.5,5,"[1.5, 1.5, 4.0, 3.5, 2.0]"
1366,2967,11,3,2017,2017-11-03,Vox,Daylight saving time ended Sunday: 6 things to know about “falling back”,"On Sunday, at 2 am, clocks turned back one hour, heralding the end of daylight saving time for much of the country. The change shifted daylight back into the morning hours. For 9-to-5 office workers, it means saying goodbye to leaving work while it’s still light out. And for weekend workers, it meant an additional glorious hour of sleep on Sunday.  And yet there’s a lot of confusion about daylight saving time.  The first thing to know: Yes, it ends in the fall, just as the decrease in daylight hours starts to become noticeable.  Let’s sort it all out.  1) Why do we need to “save” daylight hours in the summer?  Daylight saving time in the US started as an energy conservation trick during World War I, and became a national standard in the 1960s. The idea is to shift the number of daylight hours we get into the evening. So if the sun sets at 8 pm instead of 7 pm, we’d presumably spend less time with the lights on in our homes at night, saving on electricity.  It also means that you’re less likely to sleep through daylight hours in the morning (since those are shifted an hour later too). Hence “saving” daylight hours for the most productive time of the day.  Overall: We agree, the name is kind of confusing.  2) Isn’t it “daylight savings time” not “daylight saving time”?  No, it’s definitely called “daylight saving time.” Not plural.  3) Does it actually lead to energy savings?  As Joseph Stromberg outlined in an excellent 2015 Vox article, the presumed electricity conservation from the time change is unclear or nonexistent:  Despite the fact that daylight saving time was introduced to save fuel, there isn't strong evidence that the current system actually reduces energy use — or that making it year-round would do so, either. Studies that evaluate the energy impact of DST are mixed. It seems to reduce lighting use (and thus electricity consumption) slightly but may increase heating and AC use, as well as gas consumption. It's probably fair to say that energy-wise, it's a wash.  4) What would happen if daylight saving time were abolished? Or if it were extended forever?  Currently, the state of Massachusetts is in the early stages of considering a proposal to stay on daylight saving time year round. It involves shifting into Atlantic time — which is an hour ahead of Eastern time — and then staying there the whole year. (Atlantic “standard” time, and Eastern “saving” time are the same.)  The plan is a long shot. The Boston Globe explains that the Massachusetts legislature and the Department of Transportation would both have to approve it. And similar bills have failed in Maine, New Hampshire, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. But its proponents say Massachusetts would benefit by having more sunlight hours in the afternoon and evening throughout the year.  And it wouldn’t be the only state to not observe the changing of the clocks. Much of Arizona currently ignores saving time.  But why stop at Massachusetts? It’s worth thinking about what would happen if Congress abolished daylight saving time (or kept it going all year long).  Blogger and cartographer Andy Woodruff decided to visualize this with an excellent series of maps.  The goal of these maps is to show how abolishing daylight saving time, extending it all year, or going with the status quo changes the amount of days we have “reasonable” sunrise and sunset times.  Reasonable, as defined by Woodruff, is the sun rising at 7 am or earlier or setting after 5 pm (so one could, conceivably, spend some time in the sun before or after work).  This is what the map looks like under the status quo of twice-yearly clock shifts. A lot of people have unreasonable sunrise times (the dark spots) for much of the year:  Here's how things would change if daylight saving were abolished (that is, if we just stuck to the time set in the winter all year). It’s better, particularly on the sunrise end:  And here's what would happen if daylight saving were always in effect. The sunrise situation would actually be worse for most people. But many more people would enjoy after-work light — and there’s a strong argument to make that this after-work light is actually worth more. (More on that below.)  (Note: The length of light we experience each day wouldn't actually change; that's determined by the tilt of Earth's axis. But we would experience it in times more accommodating for our modern world. Be sure to check out the interactive version of these maps on Woodruff’s website.)  In 2015, Stromberg made the compelling case that the daylight saving time shift into the evening should be extended year-round. Having more light later could benefit us in a surprising number of ways:  People engage in more leisure activities after work than beforehand, so we’d likely do more physical activity over sedentary leisure activities. Relatedly, studies show that kids get more exercise when the sun is out later in the evening.  Stromberg also cites some evidence that robberies decrease when there’s more sun in the evening hours.  There could be economic gains, since people “take short trips, and buy things after work — but not before — so a longer DST slightly increases sales,” Stromberg writes.  5) Is daylight saving time dangerous?  A little bit. In the spring time, when we shift clocks forward one hour, many of us will lose that hour of sleep. In the days after daylight saving time starts, our biological clocks are a little bit off. It’s like the whole country has been given one hour of jet lag.  One hour of lost sleep sounds like a small change, but we humans are fragile, sensitive animals. Small disruptions in our sleep have been shown to alter basic indicators of our health and dull our mental edge.  And when our biological clocks are off, everything about us is out of sync. Our bodies run this tight schedule to try to keep up with our actions. Since we usually eat a meal after waking up, we produce the most insulin in the morning. We're primed to metabolize breakfast before even taking a bite. It's more efficient that way.  (There’s some good research that finds taking over-the-counter melatonin helps reset our body clocks to a new time. Read more about that here).  Being an hour off schedule means our bodies are not prepared for the actions we partake in at any time of the day.  One example: driving.  In 1999, researchers at Johns Hopkins and Stanford universities wanted to find out what happens on the road when millions of drivers have their sleep disrupted.  Analyzing 21 years of fatal car crash data from the US National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, they found a very small, but significant, increase in road deaths on the Monday after the clock shift in the spring: The number of deadly accidents jumped to an average of 83.5 on the ""spring forward"" Monday compared with an average of 78.2 on a typical Monday.  And it seems it's not just car accidents. Evidence has also mounted of an increase in incidences of workplace injuries and heart attacks in the days after we spring forward.  6) How can we end daylight saving time, or extend it all year round?  That’s easy! Well, not really: All it would take is an act of Congress. But given the current pace of major legislation, I wouldn’t count on this happening anytime soon.",4.3,5,"[5.0, 5.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0]"
1356,2955,11,3,2017,2017-11-03,Breitbart,LEAK: Google Employees Defend Discrimination Against Conservatives,"CNN recently published an in-depth piece exploring bias against conservatives in Silicon Valley. Internal discussions at Google, leaked exclusively to Breitbart News shine further light on the problem, revealing that conservative Googlers who voice concerns about political bias are often belittled and ignored by fellow employees.  A majority of Google employees have stated that the company culture has not improved since they joined the company, in an anonymous internal poll conducted shortly after the firing of viewpoint diversity advocate James Damore. In screengrabs of the discussion below the poll, one employee states a more specific concern: political intolerance.  Google “throwing money around to silence its critics” is an allegation the company has faced before, from left-wingers and mainstream journalists as well as right-wingers. It was the employee’s comments about political correctness, however, that caused ire from his colleagues, one of whom suggested he simply leave the company.  One colleague intervened, saying the comment was “no more appropriate” than telling a gay worker he would be happier if he quit his job.  Another poster interjected, comparing the statement to telling a woman forced to wear a headscarf at work to just shut up and accept it.  The original poster then returned to the thread, stating that he couldn’t even “keep his head down and work” at the company.  Another employee entered the conversation to reject the call for viewpoint diversity, telling his fellow Googler that he thought the company would be better off without him. “A culture which makes you feel uncomfortable is indeed making Google a better place,” stated the employee.  The attitude appears to reflect that of other Google employees, including managers, who openly called for supporters of James Damore to be fired and blacklisted in the wake of the viewpoint diversity controversy.  Later in the thread, a Jill Stein voter admitted that conservatives who complained about political discrimination at Google had a point. “The situation at Google is completely out of control,” says the employee.  “Now the problems have leaked out into the press and I fear they are irreparably harming the company’s reputation.”  You can follow Allum Bokhari on Twitter, Gab.ai and add him on Facebook.

1368,2970,11,3,2017,2017-11-03,Vox,The Senate’s tax plan would cut alcohol taxes. That would be a public health disaster.,"Deep within the latest Republican tax plan in the Senate, there’s a new idea that could literally put lives at risk: The proposal would cut taxes on alcohol.  The alcohol industry has been lobbying for such cuts for years. It’s finally getting what it wanted: The Senate proposal would cut federal alcohol excise taxes by 16 percent by effectively reducing taxes across the board for beer, wine, and liquor over the next two years, according to an analysis by Adam Looney at Brookings.  To many Americans, this might seem like a good idea. It means cheaper booze, after all.  But economists and public health experts argue this would amount to a public health disaster; alcohol is if anything underpriced, they argue, given the external costs that it already carries. Consider: Alcohol is linked to 88,000 deaths each year in the US — making it the third leading cause of preventable death in America after smoking and the combination of poor diet and physical inactivity. And death is only one external cost of alcohol, with others including more crime, car crashes, and reduced economic output. All of this is enabled by cheap alcohol, which makes it easier to drink in excess.  This problem would be made worse by Congress’s tax cuts. Looney analyzes the research on alcohol prices and estimates that “the legislation will cause … approximately 1,550 total alcohol-related deaths annually from all causes.” Since the tax cuts expire after 2019, that amounts to 3,100 more preventable deaths over the next two years — and more if Congress extends the tax cuts further.  From Looney’s perspective, the alcohol tax should actually be higher. For one, Congress has failed to raise federal alcohol taxes, which are separate from state taxes on alcohol, since 1991. (They were increased somewhat regularly before then.) This has already left the taxes in a pretty bad state: As the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) noted in 2016, “current excise tax rates on alcohol are far lower than historical levels when adjusted to include the effects of inflation.”  “The great opportunity we have is to restore taxes to the real value that they had a few decades ago,” Philip Cook, a public policy expert at Duke University who wrote Paying the Tab: The Costs and Benefits of Alcohol Control, previously told me. “That’s justified by the current social costs of drinking, and would have all kinds of beneficial effects, while being justified just from the point of view that drinkers should pay for the damage that they do.”  Congress is not only shirking this opportunity, but it’s actually taking the opposite route. Based on all the research on alcohol taxes, that will lead to more preventable deaths.  How the Senate proposal would cut alcohol taxes  The current Senate tax plan would make several big changes to alcohol taxes, which are broadly separated between beer, distilled spirits (liquor), and wine:  It would cut the per-barrel tax for beer from $18 to $16 for the first 6 million barrels that brewers produce or import, with anything beyond that still taxed at $18. And for small domestic brewers, the rate would be cut from $7 to $3.50 for the first 60,000 barrels and $16 beyond that.  It would enact a tiered system for distilled spirits. Today, distilled spirits are taxed at $13.50 per proof gallon. Under the proposal, they would be taxed at $2.70 per proof gallon for the first 100,000 gallons produced or imported, $13.34 for above 100,000 and up to about 22.1 million gallons, and the current $13.50 rate beyond that.  It would give producers and importers greater access to a wine tax credit.  It would eliminate some other regulations on alcohol.  The tax cuts would last through 2019, but Congress could extend them at any point.  The tax cuts are aimed at supposedly helping small producers. But Looney of Brookings argues that, based on his analysis, “the benefits will accrue to producers across the board, providing windfalls to the large oligopolies that dominate the beer, wine, and spirits industry — and to foreign producers.”  The changes would also create a potential loophole for large producers, particularly foreign ones that are more difficult for US law enforcement officials to oversee and regulate. Looney gives an example: “For instance, a large French producer who would not otherwise qualify for the lower rates could divide its production among multiple labels or multiple importers, each below the 250,000 bottle limit, evading the tax and producing a comparative advantage for the foreign producer over the American producer.”  The changes need approval from the House, Senate, and White House. It’s unclear what the tax plan’s chances of passing — much less this particular part of the plan — are.  Congress could raise the alcohol tax instead  Instead of cutting alcohol taxes, Congress could consider raising them. In fact, there’s a plan out there that already explains how this could work.  The CBO routinely releases a report called “Options for Reducing the Deficit.” As part of this, it analyzes the possibility of raising the federal government’s alcohol excise taxes.  In the 2016 report, the CBO looked at what would happen if excise taxes were raised to $16 per proof gallon for all alcoholic beverages, along with the elimination of tax credits for small producers and exemptions for personal use. It found that this would raise $70.4 billion over 10 years.  How? First, it would help level taxes between different kinds of alcoholic beverages. As the CBO explained, “the alcohol content of beer and wine is taxed at a much lower rate than the alcohol content of distilled spirits in part because the taxes are determined on the basis of different liquid measures.” This leads to big disparities:  Distilled spirits are measured in proof gallons, which denote a liquid gallon that is 50 percent alcohol by volume. The current excise tax levied on those spirits, $13.50 per proof gallon, translates to about 21 cents per ounce of pure alcohol. Beer, by contrast, is measured by the barrel, and the current tax rate of $18 per barrel translates to about 10 cents per ounce of pure alcohol (under the assumption that the alcohol content of the beer is 4.5 percent). The current levy on table wine is $1.07 per gallon, or about 6 cents per ounce of pure alcohol (assuming an alcohol content of 13 percent). Wines with high volumes of alcohol, and sparkling wines, face a higher tax per gallon.  A $16 per proof gallon tax for all alcoholic beverages, along with the elimination of related tax credits and exemptions, would level the playing field.  It would also increase alcohol taxes across the board, the CBO found: “Under this option, the federal excise tax on a 750-milliliter bottle (commonly referred to as a fifth) of distilled spirits would rise from about $2.14 to $2.54. The tax on a six-pack of beer at 4.5 percent alcohol by volume would jump from about 33 cents to 81 cents, and the tax on a 750-milliliter bottle of wine with 13 percent alcohol by volume would increase from about 21 cents to 82 cents.”  This is just one idea for raising alcohol taxes. Some experts would like to see taxes raised by more or less. But since the CBO has actually reviewed this proposal, it offers a useful starting point — one that would raise $70.4 billion over 10 years.  An alcohol tax increase would bring huge gains for public health and safety  Obviously, this means your alcohol will cost more — 40 cents for a fifth of distilled spirits, nearly 50 cents for a six-pack of beer, and more than 60 cents for a typical bottle of wine.  “What the hell, man?” you might be thinking. “Why do you want the government all over my booze?”  The simple answer: It would save lives.  Raising alcohol taxes would increase the price of alcohol, which would make drinking more expensive, which would make people less likely to excessively drink. So fewer people would be getting drunk and doing the kinds of dumb things people do while drunk. That includes not just drunk driving but other alcohol-related problems like crime — 40 percent of violent crimes in the US involve alcohol in some way — and risky sex.  “It’s a disinhibition theory,” Charles Branas, a researcher at Columbia University, previously told me. “So it’s not so much aggressiveness, but that decisions and judgment that would normally be held in check are suddenly disinhibited under consumption of alcohol.”  One question with this is, well, does it work? Sure, you can increase the tax and make alcohol cost more. But does that actually get people to drink less?  The research shows a higher alcohol tax not only gets people to drink less, but has a particular impact on excessive drinking and its negative outcomes.  The Task Force on Community Preventive Services in 2010 reviewed the research on alcohol’s “price elasticity,” which is how much consumption changes with price. The results were clear: “Nearly all studies, including those with different study designs, found that there was an inverse relationship between the tax or price of alcohol and indices of excessive drinking or alcohol-related health outcomes. Among studies restricted to underage populations, most found that increased taxes were also signifıcantly associated with reduced consumption and alcohol-related harms.”  This chart shows the findings, with each number representing the percentage effect on excess consumption for every 1 percent increase in the price of alcohol:  There’s a simple explanation for why higher alcohol taxes are effective for reducing excessive drinking in particular: If someone is only buying a six-pack of beer or one bottle of wine a week, then a price increase of 50 or 60 cents probably won’t mean much. But as someone buys more and more, that extra cost builds up — and eventually becomes inhibitive.  Other research backs up the idea. David Roodman, a senior adviser for the Open Philanthropy Project, has conducted really thorough, impressive reviews of the research, from the effects of incarceration on crime to the domestic economic impacts of immigration. He also in 2015 took a look at the research on the alcohol tax. His findings were incredible (emphasis mine):  The literature on this topic is large, and at first glance it seemed that the high-quality studies contradicted each other. Yet as I dug deeper, I found a pattern: the larger the experiment — the larger the price change — the clearer the effects. In the end, I believe the preponderance of the evidence says that higher prices do correlate with less drinking and lower incidence of problems such as cirrhosis deaths. And I see little reason to doubt the obvious explanation: higher prices cause less drinking. A rough rule of thumb is that each 1% increase in alcohol price reduces drinking by 0.5%. Extrapolating from some of the most powerful studies, I estimate an even larger impact on the death rate from alcohol-caused diseases: 1-3% within months. By extension, a 10% price increase would cut the death rate 9-25%. For the US in 2010, this represents 2,000-6,000 averted deaths/year.  To put it another way, paying about 50 cents more for a six-pack of Bud Light would probably save thousands of lives every single year.  This is a conservative estimate. It only counts deaths from alcohol-caused diseases. The number of saved lives would be higher if it accounted for alcohol-related deaths due to violence, car crashes, and other problems.  And yes, a higher alcohol tax would have an effect in those other areas as well. A 2010 review of the research in the American Journal of Public Health, for example, concluded, “Our results suggest that doubling the alcohol tax would reduce alcohol-related mortality by an average of 35%, traffic crash deaths by 11%, sexually transmitted disease by 6%, violence by 2%, and crime by 1.4%.”  In short, higher alcohol prices — and taxes — really do reduce alcohol-related problems, including heavy drinking and underage consumption.  A common counterargument is that higher alcohol taxes could lead to job losses, since the alcohol industry may be forced to fire workers or hire fewer people to make up for the profits lost as a result of the taxes and as people cut back on their drinking. But studies and researchers have found that the revenue from the taxes and the spending shift from alcohol to non-alcohol products can lead to, on net, more jobs.  But even if higher alcohol taxes lead to fewer jobs in some cases, they could still be worth it. Jobs aren’t everything; public health and safety matter too.  By simply raising alcohol taxes, America could save lives, combat crime, and slow the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. That does mean you’ll have to pay a bit more at the checkout line next time you buy your favorite chardonnay, or maybe you’ll have to pass on the chardonnay altogether — but the research suggests it’d be worth the cost.",4.071428571428571,7,"[4.0, 2.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 3.5]"

1315,2914,11,3,2017,2017-11-03,Breitbart,Report: Jared Kushner Turns Over Documents to Special Counsel Robert Mueller,"White House senior adviser Jared Kushner has turned over documents to special counsel Robert Mueller in recent weeks, and investigators have begun asking in witness interviews about the son-in-law’s role in the firing of former FBI Director James Comey, sources briefed on the probe told CNN.  Kushner reportedly advised the president to fire Comey, over the advice of some other senior advisers, and was present during a weekend when the president drafted a letter to fire the director.  The questioning of Kushner’s role in Comey’s firing signals that Mueller has moved past the campaign and is looking at whether there was any obstruction of justice in firing the former FBI director, who was then leading the Russia probe. Kushner is reportedly not a target of the investigation.  The 36-year-old voluntarily turned over documents from the campaign and from the transition, which were similar to ones he had given congressional investigators earlier this year.  A White House official told CNN that the special counsel’s questions about Kushner are not a surprise.  How much of a factor Kushner played in Comey’s firing is a point of dispute within the White House, with some sources telling CNN he had no influence and others calling him the “driver” of the decision.  Kushner has denied any collusion or wrongdoing during or after the election season.  Kushner has come under scrutiny for attending a meeting with a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower, which was set up under the premise that she had dirt on Hillary Clinton. During the meeting, the lawyer reportedly lobbied Donald Trump, Jr., Kushner, and then-campaign chair Paul Manafort on overturning the Magnitsky Act.  Kushner was also under scrutiny for meetings with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. and a Russian banker, and for failing to list hundreds of meetings with foreign contacts on his security clearance forms, which he blamed on an assistant.  Other “points of focus” on Kushner include his involvement on Trump’s campaign data analytics operation, and his relationship with former national security adviser Michael Flynn, sources told CNN.",3.5,6,"[3.0, 3.5, 2.5, 5.0, 3.0, 4.0]"
1319,2918,11,3,2017,2017-11-03,Fox News,This artificial intelligence can detect if someone is having suicidal thoughts,"Artificial intelligence could one day be used to help identify a person contemplating suicide.  Around 800,000 people die a year from suicide, according to the World Health Organization. It’s currently the second-leading cause of death in the U.S. among people between the ages of 15 and 24.  But a new study is using brain scans and AI to show how someone experiencing suicidal thoughts thinks differently about life and death. The results were published in Nature Human Behavior.  “What is central to this new study is that we can tell whether someone is considering suicide by the way that they are thinking about the death-related topics,” Marcel Just, the study’s co-lead author, told CMU.edu.  Researchers looked at 34 participants, 17 of whom were experiencing suicidal thoughts. Each person underwent brain imaging with an MRI machine while being shown a series of words that were related to different emotions. Ten words had a positive emotional relation, such as “carefree,” 10 were negative, like “trouble,” and 10 were related to suicide, including “desperate” and “hopeless.”  Based on the participants that were already considered suicidal, the researchers were able to map five regions of the brain and six words that could identify someone as suicidal. Next they devised an algorithm to spot the same thing.  The algorithm correctly identified 15 of the 17 suicidal patients and 16 of the 17 members in the control group.  Researchers then applied the algorithm to the group of participants experiencing suicidal thoughts – half had previously attempted suicide and half had not. The algorithm correctly identified 94 percent of the participants who had attempted suicide.  “Further testing of this approach in a larger sample will determine its ability to predict future suicidal behavior,” said David Brent, co-head author of the study. “And could give clinicians in the future a way to identify, monitor and perhaps intervene with the altered and often distorted thinking that so often characterizes seriously suicidal individuals.”  This story originally appeared in the New York Post.",3.4545454545454546,11,"[3.5, 2.5, 4.5, 1.5, 4.5, 3.0, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.0, 5.0]"

""We must create equal participation in these traditionally male-dominated sectors of our economy.""

""This takes many forms, including harassment, which can never be tolerated.""  Perhaps in deference to Ivanka Trump, Tokyo's Metropolitan Police Department deployed an all-female security team to guard America's first daughter, the Asahi Shimbun reported.

1336,2935,11,3,2017,2017-11-03,Associated Press News,Female lawmakers allege harassment by colleagues in House," For years, Republican Rep. Mary Bono endured increasingly suggestive comments from a fellow lawmaker in the House of Representatives. But when the congressman approached her on the House floor and told her he’d been thinking about her in the shower, she’d had enough.  She confronted the man, who she said still serves in Congress, telling him his comments were demeaning and wrong. And he backed off.  Bono, who served 15 years before being defeated in 2012, is not alone.  As reports pile up of harassment or worse by men in entertainment, business and the media, one current and three former female lawmakers tell The Associated Press that they, too, have been harassed or subjected to hostile sexual comments — by fellow members of Congress.  Their stories, published Friday by The AP, renewed calls to tighten up Congress’ own lax training and reporting requirements. House Speaker Paul Ryan sent a memo to fellow lawmakers encouraging them to complete sexual harassment training and mandate it for their staffs, telling them, “Harassment has no place in this institution. ... We can and should lead by example.”  The example set by male members of Congress has not always been admirable, as the accounts from the four female lawmakers who spoke with The AP make clear.  The incidents they recounted occurred years or even decades ago, usually when the women were young newcomers to Congress. They range from isolated comments at one hearing, to repeated unwanted come-ons, to lewd remarks and even groping on the House floor. Coming amid an intensifying national focus on sexual harassment and gender hostility in the workplace, the revelations underscore that no woman is immune, even at the highest reaches of government.  “This is about power,” said Democratic former California Sen. Barbara Boxer, after describing an incident at a hearing in the 1980s where a male colleague made a sexually suggestive comment about her from the dais, which was met with general laughter and an approving second from the committee chairman.  “That was an example of the way I think we were thought of, a lot of us. ... It’s hostile and embarrasses, and therefore could take away a person’s power,” she said.  Bono, Boxer and the other female lawmakers spoke on the record to tell their stories in the wake of revelations about Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein’s serial attacks on women, as well as disclosures from current and former Capitol Hill staffers about harassment by lawmakers and aides.  Largely untold before now is that some female lawmakers themselves say they have been harassed by male colleagues. While rare, the accounts raise troubling questions about the boys’ club environment in Congress where male lawmakers can feel empowered to target not only staffers but even their own peers.  The lawmakers declined to identify the perpetrators by name, but they said at least two of the men continue to serve in the House. None of the female lawmakers interviewed reported what happened, and some noted it was not clear where they would lodge such a complaint. At least three of the four told friends or aides about the incidents, which in some cases were witnessed by other lawmakers.  “When I was a very new member of Congress in my early 30s, there was a more senior member who outright propositioned me, who was married, and despite trying to laugh it off and brush it aside it, would repeat. And I would avoid that member,” said Rep. Linda Sanchez, D-Calif. She added that she would warn other new female members about the lawmaker in question, but she declined to identify him, while saying he remains in Congress.  “I just don’t think it would be helpful” to call the lawmaker out by name, Sanchez said. “The problem is, as a member there’s no HR department you can go to, there’s nobody you can turn to. Ultimately they’re employed by their constituents.”  Sanchez also said that a different male colleague repeatedly ogled her, and at one point touched her inappropriately on the House floor, while trying to make it appear accidental. She declined to identify the lawmaker but said he was no longer in Congress.  Bono, who arrived in the House at age 36 to replace her husband Sonny Bono after he died in a skiing accident, said she ultimately confronted her colleague on the House floor after he’d made repeated harassing comments.  She said it seemed like the lawmaker didn’t know how to talk to a woman as an equal. “Instead of being, ‘How’s the weather, how’s your career, how’s your bill,’ it was, ‘I thought about you while I was in the shower.’ So it was a matter of saying to him, ‘That’s not cool, that’s just not cool.’”  Bono declined to identify the lawmaker, saying the behavior stopped after she finally challenged him. He still serves in Congress, she said.  “It is a man’s world, it’s still a man’s world,” Bono said. “Not being a flirt and not being a bitch. That was my rule, to try to walk that fine line.”  Former Rep. Hilda Solis, now a Los Angeles County supervisor, recalls repeated unwanted harassing overtures from one lawmaker, though she declined to name him or go into detail.  “I don’t think I’m the only one. What I tried to do was ignore it, turn away, walk away. Obviously it’s offensive. Are you supposed to be flattered? No, we’re adults. Not appropriate,” said Solis, who left Congress in 2009 to join the Obama administration as labor secretary.  “It’s humiliating, even though they may have thought they were being cute. No, it’s not. It’s not appropriate. I’m your colleague, but he doesn’t see me that way, and that’s a problem,” Solis said.  The experiences occurred against the backdrop of broader gender inequities in Congress, where women remain a distinct minority, making up only about 20 percent of members in the House and Senate. That’s up from fewer than 10 percent in the quarter-century since politics’ Year of the Woman in 1992. That election season, large numbers of women sought office following hearings by the then-all-male Senate Judiciary Committee over Anita Hill’s testimony about alleged sexual harassment by Clarence Thomas, who was subsequently confirmed to the Supreme Court.  The increase in numbers and the prominence of a few individual women, such as House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, has not resulted in parity in all measures, nor eliminated the potential for male members to demean or even harass their female counterparts. Nonetheless, a few female lawmakers contacted by the AP expressed surprise and even disbelief at the notion that lawmakers themselves could be victims of harassment.  Democratic Rep. Jackie Speier of California has recently gone public with an account of being sexually assaulted by a male chief of staff while she was a congressional staffer. She has criticized the vague rules in place on the issue and has introduced legislation aimed at increasing protections for congressional employees. In a video posted to Twitter last week, she called Congress “a breeding ground for a hostile work environment” and encouraged others to come forward.  Yet when it comes to lawmakers themselves, Speier said: “I think the women in Congress are big girls. The equalizer that exists in Congress that doesn’t exist in other settings is that we all get paid the same amount and we all have a vote, the same vote. So if you have members that are demeaning you it’s because you’re letting them.”  Democratic former Rep. Ellen Tauscher of California argued that although male lawmakers “can be jackasses ... I don’t believe members of Congress can sexually harass each other, which is a legal term of art, because we are equals in our work.”  In fact, the law specifies that harassment can occur between equals, said Jennifer Drobac, a professor at the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law, who teaches a course in sexual harassment law.  “Formally, two members of Congress may have the same status. That doesn’t change the fact that sexual harassment can occur between peers,” Drobac said, noting that numerous other factors can come into play, including the difference in age and length of service between the members, and the mere fact that men have more power in society than women.  Yet the fact that some dispute whether harassment could even occur between members of Congress underscores the complexity of the issue and the fraught questions surrounding it.  Bono said she found power in confronting her harasser, and that after she did so it never happened again. She emphasized that she encountered only a couple out-of-line colleagues during her time in the House, and said that she understood her experience was different than those of young staffers who may face harassment from someone who could retaliate against them.  But Bono strongly disputed any suggestion that she or any other female lawmaker could not be harassed by their peers.  “My career didn’t suffer, I didn’t suffer,” Bono said. “But it did happen.”  ___  Follow Erica Werner on Twitter @ericawerner and Juliet Linderman @julietlinderman",3.477272727272727,22,"[5.0, 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 0.5, 1.5, 4.5, 4.0, 0.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.0, 2.5, 3.5, 4.0, 2.0, 2.5]"

Instead, it takes aim at a much smaller health care program: a deduction for exceptionally high medical expenses.

For more newsletters, check out our newsletters page  What is it? The medical expenses deduction allows people with especially high health care costs to deduct that spending on their tax reform. To qualify, you must spend at least 10 percent of your income on medical expenses. The IRS maintains a lengthy list of what counts as medical spending that includes some things you might expect, like fees paid to doctors or spending on prescription drugs. And there are some things you might not expect. Turns out, one can deduct the price of joining a weight loss club or attending a conference related to one's own health conditions. Self-employed individuals are typically able to deduct their insurance premiums, too.  Where did it come from? The medical expense deduction goes all the way back to the United States Revenue Act of 1942. Keep in mind this is two decades before Medicare and Medicaid were created. There was much less of a safety net for those with especially high medical bills.  There is some evidence that the deduction was meant to be a temporary postwar measure, as Kelly Phillips has previously detailed for Forbes. A Senate Finance Committee report on the 1942 tax bill justifies the medical deduction as follows:  This allowance is recommended in consideration of the heavy tax burden that must be borne by individuals during the existing emergency and of the desirability of maintaining the present high level of public health and morale.  About 80 years later, however, it's quite clear that this was not a temporary provision but rather a permanent part of the tax code. The only thing that has changed is how much medical expense one needs to qualify for the deduction. Most recently, the Affordable Care Act raised the threshold from 7.5 to 10 percent of income.  Who uses it? An estimated 8.8 million Americans use the deduction for medical expenses. This makes it one of the smaller deductions — it's nowhere near the size of the mortgage deduction, for example.  Most deductions benefit wealthier Americans, who are more likely to itemize their deductions in the first place. But the medical deduction is actually a bit different: It is used more by poorer tax filers than those who are especially rich.  The Congressional Research Service estimates that 3 percent of tax filers who earn less than $20,000 use the medical expenses deduction, compared to less than 1 percent of people earning more than $1 million.  And this, in a way, makes sense: Most people who earn more than $1 million have health insurance. In order to get above the 10 percent threshold, they would have to spend at least $100,000 out of pocket on medical expenses in the course of one year.  But someone who earns $20,000 would only need to spend $2,000 on medical expenses to cross the 10 percent threshold. And this is also a demographic that is less likely to have health insurance coverage.  What happens if the medical expenses deduction disappears? Most obviously, tax filers would no longer be able to deduct their medical expenses. And, as described earlier, this is one of the provisions of the tax code that currently helps a small subset of low-income Americans.  The AARP has opposed the elimination of the medical expense deduction. ""Eliminating the medical expense deduction amounts to a health tax on millions of Americans with high medical costs — especially middle income seniors,"" the group said in a statement. ""AARP is strongly opposed to this provision.""  Republicans, meanwhile, have argued that other changes in the tax bill would offset the loss of the medical expenses deduction for those who lose it. But as Dylan Matthews writes, this bill has winners and losers. Those who are wealthiest do best, while poor families would lose out under the current proposal.  Chart of the Day  Zeke Emanuel proposes new ""affordability index"" — and it shows health care getting less affordable  A novel approach to measuring health costs. Zeke Emanuel, Aaron Glickman, and David Johnson propose in the Journal of the American Medical Association a new ""affordability index"" as a way to measure health costs in America. It essentially compares the mean cost of employer-sponsored coverage to median household wages to get a sense of how big a burden health costs come out to be. It shows health care (unsurprisingly!) has gotten less affordable over the past two decades. Read more here.

It was part of a mid-morning Twitter barrage in which Trump called for his own Justice Department to probe a range of scandals involving the Democratic Party and his vanquished 2016 presidential rival, Hillary Clinton.  “Everybody is asking why the Justice Department (and FBI) isn’t looking into all of the dishonesty going on with Crooked Hillary & the Dems,” Trump tweeted early Friday. “New Donna B book says she paid for and stole the Dem Primary. What about the deleted E-mails, Uranium, Podesta, the Server, plus, plus…”  In excerpts released Thursday from an upcoming book, Brazile, a longtime party stalwart and Clinton confidante, confirmed longstanding suspicions that the Democratic National Committee she once headed worked with Clinton to ensure she won the party's presidential primary over Sanders, the Vermont senator who built a huge following with his blend of Democrat politics and socialism.  ""I always felt I would be running and winning against Bernie Sanders, not Crooked H, without cheating, I was right,"" Trump tweeted.  Brazile's explosive charge has sent shockwaves through the party.  “I had promised Bernie when I took the helm of the Democratic National Committee after the convention that I would get to the bottom of whether Hillary Clinton’s team had rigged the nomination process, as a cache of emails stolen by Russian hackers and posted online had suggested,” Brazile wrote in a book excerpt first published in Politico Magazine. “By Sept. 7, the day I called Bernie, I had found my proof and it broke my heart.”  The proof, according to Brazile, was a joint fundraising agreement document between the DNC, the Hillary Victory Fund and Hillary for America. It had been signed in August 2015, four months after Clinton announced her candidacy and a year before she officially secured the nomination over Sanders.  “The agreement –signed by Amy Dacey, the former CEO of the DNC and Robby Mook, with a copy to Marc Elias—specified that in exchange for raising money and investing in the DNC, Hillary would control the party’s finances, strategy, and all the money raised,” Brazile wrote. “Her campaign had the right of refusal of who would be the party communications director, and it would make final decision on all the other staff.”  DONNA BRAZILE: I FOUND 'PROOF' THE DNC RIGGED THE NOMINATION FOR HILLARY CLINTON  Even before Friday morning's tweetstorm, Trump reacted to the allegations against Clinton on Thursday night on “The Ingraham Angle.”  “It’s illegal, number one, and it’s really unfair to Bernie Sanders,” Trump said. “I’m not a Bernie Sanders fan, although I must say I got a lot of his votes when he was thrown out. Many of those people voted for me because of trade because I agreed with him on trade…But that was, I thought that was terrible.”  ""Pocahontas just stated that the Democrats, lead by the legendary Crooked Hillary Clinton, rigged the Primaries! Lets go FBI & Justice Dept.,"" Trump tweeted again. 'Pocahontas,' when used by the president, is typically in reference to Sen. Elizabeth Warren.  In an interview with Jake Tapper on CNN Thursday, Warren, D-Mass., was asked whether she believed the DNC was rigged, to which the senator simply responded, ""Yes.""  But on Friday, Trump took the opportunity to add the Brazile bombshell to a list of allegations and situations that he wants his Justice Department to investigate, including her “deleted E-mails” and “the Server,” pointing back to the months-long Clinton email investigation.  Trump also referred to “Uranium,” alluding to the controversial Obama-era Uranium One deal. The 2010 deal concerns the sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to Russia’s Rosatom nuclear company. The U.S. was involved because the sale gave the Russians control of part of the uranium supply in the U.S. Clinton, at the time, was secretary of state.  TRUMP CALLS DNC PRIMARY-RIGGING 'ILLEGAL,' SLAMS 'FAKE' DOSSIER IN FOX NEWS INTERVIEW  Trump also referred to “Podesta,” though it is unclear if he was referring to Democratic lobbyist Tony Podesta, or his brother, Clinton’s longtime confidante and 2016 campaign manager John Podesta.  This week, Tony Podesta stepped down from his lobbying firm, which was co-founded with his brother John, in the wake of special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe expanding to question Podesta’s Foreign Agent Registration (FARA) filings, and whether he was in violation of that law.  A spokesperson for Podesta told Fox News that they were compliant with their FARA filings and were “fully” cooperating with Mueller’s team.  The president tweeted again, moments later, underscoring the need for a federal probe.  ""....People are angry. At some point the Justice Department, and the FBI, must do what is right and proper. The American public deserves it!"" Trump tweeted.",3.0454545454545454,11,"[3.5, 1.5, 4.0, 5.0, 3.0, 2.0, 5.0, 4.5, 0.5, 0.5, 4.0]"
1348,2947,11,3,2017,2017-11-03,Vox,The Trump administration is going after the lawyers of an immigrant teen who had an abortion,"For more than a month this fall, a teenager known as Jane Doe fought the federal government for the right to get an abortion while living in an immigration shelter. She succeeded in getting the procedure last week — but the government is still fighting.  The Department of Justice now argues that the American Civil Liberties Union, which represented Doe in court, misled the government about the timing of Doe’s abortion. The department is petitioning the Supreme Court to vacate a lower court’s ruling in the case, which could have consequences for other pregnant minors in Doe’s position. It is also asking the Supreme Court to consider disciplinary action against Doe’s legal team.  Doe, who is 17 and arrived to the US undocumented and without her parents, lives in a Texas shelter under the jurisdiction of the Office of Refugee Resettlement. A new ORR policy, instituted under the Trump administration, bars unaccompanied, undocumented minors from getting abortions without permission from the director of ORR. Doe and her lawyers were battling this policy, and on October 24, a court ruled that the government could not block her from getting an abortion. (You can read more about the case here.) On the morning of October 25, Doe was able to get an abortion.  The government now says the ACLU had agreed to inform them when Doe’s abortion was scheduled, and did not do so. The government knew that Doe had an appointment scheduled for October 25, but believed it was for preabortion counseling, not abortion. Under Texas law, anyone seeking an abortion must get counseling at least 24 hours prior to the procedure, from the doctor who will perform the abortion. Doe had received counseling from a doctor the week of October 16, and since that doctor was able to perform her abortion, she did not need counseling again.  According to its petition, the Justice Department had planned to file an application for a stay on the morning of October 25 that would have delayed the abortion further, but Doe got the procedure before the department was able to do so.  The petition asks the Supreme Court to vacate the October 24 decision that allowed Doe to get an abortion. Obviously, this would not affect Doe directly; she has already gotten the procedure. But the ACLU has filed a motion for class certification, which could help other unaccompanied minors get abortions without government interference. If the court decision in Doe’s favor is vacated, lawyers would no longer be able to cite that precedent in arguing on behalf of all unaccompanied minors.  The Justice Department’s petition also suggests that the Supreme Court explore taking disciplinary action against Doe’s lawyers, either directly or through state bar associations, “for what appear to be material misrepresentations and omissions to government counsel designed to thwart this Court’s review.”  “Friday’s appeal is a flagrant effort to crucify the individual attorneys who represented Doe, and to terrify likeminded lawyers into acquiescence,” Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern write at Slate. “The DOJ is using the full weight of a government agency to threaten professional ruin upon the lawyers who defended Jane Doe’s constitutional right to abortion access.”  The ACLU argues that Doe’s lawyers were under no legal obligation to tell the government when her abortion was scheduled. “The medical details of her appointment are something for her and her doctor,” said David Cole, the legal director of the ACLU. To the extent that the ACLU notified the government of Doe’s schedule at all, he said, it was for logistical reasons, to set up Doe’s release from the shelter and transfer to the clinic.  The government could have appealed the October 24 decision immediately, Cole said, and did not do so. “Now after being criticized for that by the anti-choice movement, they’re seeking to deflect the blame onto us,” he said.  In an October 27 interview on Fox News, anchor Bret Baier asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions to respond to “pro-life critics out there saying your department dropped the ball on this” by not appealing sooner. Sessions said that the timing of the abortion “was a total surprise” and represented “a breach of the kind of confidence that lawyers should be able to have with one another.”  ""I don't believe that we should be using taxpayers’ dollars to fund abortions and I think in this case, it certainly was not justified,"" he added. ""I'm very disappointed that these lawyers were able to take the client around the law to avoid a court hearing.""  Jane Doe did not seek federal funding for her abortion, and private funds, not federal dollars, paid for the procedure, according to the ACLU.  The ACLU has 60 days to respond to the Justice Department’s petition, and then the Supreme Court will decide whether to hear the case. “We will be urging the court to deny the petition,” Cole said.",3.9285714285714284,7,"[3.0, 4.5, 4.5, 2.5, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5]"
1349,2948,11,3,2017,2017-11-03,Fox News,Sanctuary cities flip-flop costly for Virginia Dem Ralph Northam,"Ralph Northam, the Democratic nominee for Virginia governor, is losing support from one of the country’s largest and most progressive political action committees, which accuses the candidate of racists acts.  Progressive PAC Democracy for America (DFA) – which boasts more than 42,000 members in the Old Dominion alone -- announced this week that it will stop “any work to directly aid” the campaign, NationalReview.com reported.  Northam faces Republican nominee Ed Gillespie in next week’s election.  Northam is the state's current lieutenant governor. Gillespie is a former chairman of the Republican National Committee.  DFA said in a statement released Thursday night that it removed references to Northam in its get-out-the-vote calls after the Democratic candidate’s campaign airbrushed photos of lieutenant-governor candidate Justin Fairfax, who is African American, off campaign fliers.  The move allegedly was made to gain favor with a high-powered union. DFA officials say that the airbrushing was a “racist action.”  The PAC originally chose not to publicly discuss its decision, but reversed course after Northam said that if any city in Virginia attempted to declare sanctuary status for illegal immigrants, he would support legislation as governor to prevent them from doing so.  “[A]fter seeing Northam play directly into the hands of Republicans’ racist anti-immigrant rhetoric on sanctuary cities, we refuse to be ... even remotely complicit in the disastrous, racist, and voter-turnout-depressing campaign Ralph Northam appears intent on running,” reads the DFA statement.  “Let’s be really clear: If Ralph Northam wins next Tuesday, it won’t be because he publicly backtracked on his commitment to protecting immigrant families, but in spite of it.”  It’s believed that Northam changed his views on sanctuary cities to appeal to supporters of Gillespie.  The about-face from Northam occurred after Gillespie’s efforts to link the lieutenant governor to sanctuary cities to portray him as being soft on crime. He has made the case in debates and a barrage of TV ads that the policy of protecting illegal immigrants from federal immigration officials has helped spur the rise of the violent Central American MS-13 gang.  ""MS-13 is a menace, yet Ralph Northam voted in favor of sanctuary cities that let dangerous illegal immigrants back on the street, increasing the threat of MS-13,"" the narrator says in one ad.  The Northam campaign has used its own TV ads to fight back against Gillespie’s efforts to tie its candidate to violent Latino gangs like MS-13 and sanctuary cities, saying the connection is “not true.”  Northam led by 7 percentage points just several weeks ago, but Gillespie now leads by 2 points, according to the most recent RealClearPolitics polls.  Virginia has elected a Republican governor only once in roughly the past 15 years, and it was the only Southern state that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton won last year.

Beyond the Federal Reserve, the big political story of the week was the race between the Republican Party’s top policy priority — a major tax bill — and the rising tide of scandal that is threatening to engulf the Trump administration. Fresh indictments from special counsel Robert Mueller brought criminality into the inner sanctum of the Trump campaign, while also kicking loose new reporting and new testimony that raises new questions about Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s knowledge and honesty in earlier statements to Congress.  Here’s what you need to know.  We finally saw the GOP’s tax bill  After months of discussion and rumors, House Republicans finally rolled out actual legislative text for a tax bill, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which offers about $1.5 trillion in net tax cuts over 10 years. That money goes mostly, though not exclusively, to business owners and inheritors of large fortunes. But within the $1.5 trillion net change are much larger gross shifts, with some taxes going down and others going up, setting the stage for some potentially very complicated politics.  Key House sticking point: The bill would eliminate the existing state and local tax (SALT) deduction and replace it with a less generous property tax credit worth up to $10,000. This seems to be the key political sticking point in the House, where many members from California and the Northeast aren’t excited about raising taxes on their constituents.

Senate trouble ahead: The TCJA, as written, faces a huge problem in the Senate because a permanent, deficit-increasing tax cut — which is what the TCJA is — violates the terms of the budget reconciliation process and could be filibustered by Democrats unless it’s substantially rewritten.

What’s next? The House Ways and Means Committee will begin the formal “markup” process next week and, in theory, will consider amendments. But realistically, changes, if they happen, will be negotiated informally with House leadership. The Senate is also expected to release its own version of the bill next week.  Mueller revealed indictments — and a guilty plea  News leaked last weekend that special counsel Robert Mueller would unseal indictments on Monday, and he did — of former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort and his business associate Rick Gates for a range of financial crimes. But soon after came a surprise — a guilty plea, entered months ago, by former Trump campaign foreign policy aide George Papadopoulos for lying to the FBI.  Why it matters: That the president hired a criminal with compromising, illicit ties to Ukrainian oligarchs and Russian government figures, and then continued to employ his longtime business associate even after Manafort himself was fired, is significant on its own terms. Indeed, in a normal administration these basic facts would be a huge, news-dominating scandal.

Why it really matters: Issuing indictments while the investigation is still ongoing — especially when paired with the Papadopoulos plea — strongly suggests an effort to get Manafort or Gates (or both) to cut a deal and start cooperating with the investigators in exchange for leniency.

Jeff Sessions is back in the spotlight  Attorney General Jeff Sessions is one of the few non-family links between the senior levels of the Trump campaign and the senior levels of the Trump administration. Having already gotten himself into hot water by “forgetting” about meetings with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during his confirmation hearings, he’s coming under new pressure this week, as it turns out he was involved in discussions with lower-level campaign aides about potential collaboration with the Russian government.  A new story from Sessions’s camp: NBC News reported Thursday that Sessions aides are saying he heard and rejected Papadopoulos’s campaign-era proposal to use his “Russian contacts” to set up a meeting between Trump and Vladimir Putin. On one level, that’s an exculpatory story for Sessions. On another level, it appears to contradict his previous testimony that he had “no knowledge” about any campaign contacts with the Russians.

A different story from Carter Page: Page, the colorful adventurer who seems to have tried to set himself up as a Trump-Putin go-between of some kind, testified on Thursday to Congress that he apprised Sessions of his summer 2016 trip to Russia.

O’Donovan is now being represented by Obey Shava of Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights, who said authorities made the decision to arrest her because of “tweets emanating from her IT address [that were] insulting to the president.”  She had been living in Zimbabwe as part of her work for Magamba TV, which describes itself as the “leading producer of cutting-edge, political satire and comedy shows” aimed at a younger audience.

Earlier today the police arrested @Martha_ODonovan for allegedly insulting the president on socia media. — Magamba Tv (@MagambaTV) November 3, 2017  According to Zimbabwean outlet Harare 24, authorities had obtained a warrant for a morning raid on O’Donovan’s property and seized all of her electronic devices.  The tweet in question reportedly “referred to a certain Goblin, whose wife and stepsons imported a Rolls Royce vehicle,” although it did not make a direct reference to Robert Mugabe, the nation’s nonagenarian dictator. It is not visible due to the privacy settings on her account.  O’Donovan’s arrest comes a month after Mugabe appointed a minister for cybersecurity tasked with policing crimes on social media, which government critics dubbed the “minister of Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp affairs.”  Last year, an anti-government pastor was also arrested after circulating videos highlighting the country’s worsening economic problems, which included people waiting in long lines for basic products such as food and fuel, while the group Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights claims it has represented nearly 200 people charged with criticizing the government.  The move was also an attempt to crack down on growing anti-government dissidence across Zimbabwe, especially with the rise of protest movements primarily organized via social media.  It also coincides with the country’s 2018 elections, with 93-year-old Mugabe still intending to run for another five-year term as leader of the left-wing nationalist Zimbabwe African National Union, meaning he would be 99 by the time he left office.  Mugabe, who has ruled Zimbabwe by decree since becoming president in 1980 following independence from Britain, last won re-election in 2013, in a vote widely condemned as fraudulent by members of the international community.

1433,3053,11,3,2017,2017-11-03,Fox News,Forests lost in wildfires could be replanted by drones,"U.S. wildfires have left a trail of devastation behind them in recent months. According to the National Interagency Fire Center, from Jan. 1 through Oct. 6, 2017 there were 50, 283 wildfires in the United States– up from 46,618 last year. Acres lost numbered about 3.7 million more than 2016 as well, with 8.5 million acres of forestland going up in smoke. It’s not just a problem in the US–wildfire numbers are going up worldwide, and it’s only going to get worse.  “As air temperatures continue to increase over time, there will be more days during which wildfires can be ignited and burn, so there will be more fires,” Research Forester David L. Peterson told Fox News. “More extreme temperatures will allow some fires to burn more intensely and spread faster, making them more difficult to suppress.”  Now, U.K.–based startup BioCarbon Engineering hopes to reverse some of the damage with drone technology. Reportedly, their drones can plant up to 100,000 trees in one day.  SILICON VALLEY HISTORY LOST: ARCHIVE OF DOCUMENTS THAT BELONGED TO HP FOUNDERS DESTROYED IN WILDFIRE  “The current state-of-the-art is the hand–planting of saplings,” former NASA engineer and BioCarbon CEO Lauren Fletcher said. “The goal of our technology is to make the current planters more effective at what they do.”  According to Fletcher, his drones can plant trees 60 times faster than hand-planting. First, a group of drones perform a 3D aerial survey of the land for topography and soil quality data. After a seeding pattern is planned, the drones are loaded with seed pods. These pods are pressurized canisters that burst upon impact and are filled with germinated seeds soaked in a nutrient–rich gel. The drones then set out over the mapped terrain, hovering up to 6 feet and firing their pods (about ten per minute) into the ground. The seedlings are then monitored for growth.  “We have designed our system so that two pilots will run multiple drones simultaneously, allowing for a daily planting rate of 100,000 trees per day,” Fletcher told Fox News. “Just 60 teams will allow us to plant 1 billion trees a year, with the potential to scale to 10's of billions of trees every year.”  DRONES CAPTURES CAPSIZING BOAT AND FLORIDA TEEN'S DARING RESCUE  Another advantage drones have over human planters is that they’re able to plant in difficult-to-reach areas, such as mountainsides or mangroves.  BioCarbon is currently looking to have its drones replanting forests in the U.S. by April 2018 at the latest, just in time for the spring planting season. The startup hopes to replant in areas devastated by Hurricane Katrina as well as out west where forests have been decimated by bark beetle infestations and wildfires.  “The next phase for us is to continue to work in larger scale and to upgrade the designs to make them more automated so that we can start distributing this technology to those people who are already planting trees,” Fletcher said. “The key to success is empowering governments and local communities with this emerging technology.”  DRONES FLYING OVER CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES HURT FIREFIGHING EFFORTS, OFFICIALS SAY  Drones, however, can pose challenges in emergency situations if their operators are not part of the emergency recovery effort. For example, drones capturing footage of the recent California wildfires were hindering firefighters’ efforts, according to officials.  The technology, however, can be a great asset if it is in the right hands. Drones are being used to help ground crews monitor wildfire activity, and firefighters in New York have also used drones for fire monitoring. With technology advancing quickly, who knows what the future holds? For example, a prototype drone that will harness foam to fight fires recently went on display in Dubai.  “Whether it’s seeding or firefighting or wildlife management or insect/disease scouting, the large land areas that must be managed means that drones will play an ever greater role in such forestry operations,” Dr. Daniel Schmoldt, an expert on high-tech applications in natural resources, told Fox News. “As autonomy-enabling technologies advance, flight times increase, and government regulations fully enable drone deployment, especially smart and autonomous ones, drones will be a game-changer for forest and environmental management.”",3.857142857142857,7,"[4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 1.5, 5.0]"

But the increases will not be uniform; by near the end of the century the worst ozone levels will be found across a wide expanse of the Midwest and Northern Great Plains, while levels are expected to improve, at least somewhat, in parts of the Southeast.  The report reiterates what residents of the West have learned from hard experience: that warmer springs, longer dry seasons in the summer and other impacts are lengthening the fire season. The smoke from fires affects not only health, the report says, but visibility.  Adaptation, adaptation, adaptation  Since 2014, more detailed economic research has estimated that climate change could cause hundreds of billions of dollars in annual damage, as deadly heat waves, coastal flooding, and an increase in extreme weather take their toll. Unless, that is, communities take steps to prepare beforehand.  The previous assessment warned that few states and cities were taking steps to adapt to the impacts of climate change. That’s slowly changing, the new draft finds. More and more communities are taking measures such as preserving wetlands along the coasts to act as buffers against storms.  But outside of a few places in Louisiana and Alaska, few coastal communities are rethinking their development patterns in order to avoid the impacts from rising seas and severe weather that the report says are surely coming.  Beyond borders  The United States military has long taken climate change seriously, both for its potential impacts on troops and infrastructure around the world and for its potential to cause political instability in other countries.  The draft report cites these international concerns, but goes far beyond the military.

1470,3121,11,3,2017,2017-11-03,Vox,Thousands of heart patients get stents that may do more harm than good,"There’s an epidemic of unnecessary medical treatments, as David Epstein of ProPublica recently documented in a terrific investigation: Doctors routinely perform procedures that aren’t based on high-quality research, or even in spite of evidence that contradicts their use.  One of the prime examples of a dubious treatment that Epstein and others have pointed to is cardiologists putting little mesh tubes called stents in patients with stable angina — chest pain caused by clogged coronary arteries that arises only with physical exertion or emotional stress.  Doctors insert the devices into narrowed or blocked arteries to pop them open, helping blood flow to the heart again. The idea is that stents should help soothe the suffering of patients with angina (or chest pain) and drive down the risk of a heart attack and death in the future.  But studies show that stable angina can be well controlled with medication. And researchers have found that stenting chest pain patients doesn’t help them live longer or reduce their risk of disease — in fact, heart attacks and strokes can be potentially deadly side effects of stent procedures. There’s also been a lingering question about whether stents truly work to relieve pain.  Now, researchers from the United Kingdom have published a high-quality study in the Lancet that helps answer the pain question. Building on years of lower-quality evidence, the well-designed study suggests stents may in fact be useless for pain in people with stable angina who are being treated with medication.  ""Surprisingly, even though the stents improved blood supply, they didn't provide more relief of symptoms compared to drug treatments, at least in this patient group,"" said Rasha Al-Lamee, lead author of the study and a researcher at the National Heart and Lung Institute at Imperial College London, in a statement. This doesn’t mean stents should never be used in stable chest pain patients — some patients can’t take the medications that control angina, for example — but doctors may want to consider inserting these devices as a last resort.  Considering 500,000 patients get stents for stable angina each year in the US and Europe alone, and the devices can cost up to $67,000, depending on the hospital and a patient’s insurance coverage, the Lancet paper is poised to shake up cardiology, as the New York Times reported.  The trial is also important for another big reason: It raises critical questions about the quality of evidence doctors rely on to make life-and-death decisions for their patients.  The controversy over stents for patients with stable chest pain  Over the years, studies have been piling up that suggest stenting stable angina patients may not actually be all that helpful.  A decade ago, researchers published a study in the New England Journal of Medicine showing that stents did not improve patients’ mortality risk or cardiovascular disease outcomes. Since then, meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials on stents in stable angina patients have similarly found the devices don’t outperform more conservative medical therapies (such as medication) when it comes to preventing heart attacks or extending patients’ life expectancy in the long term.  There was still a question about using stents in stable patients, whether the devices could relieve chest pain in the shorter term. Data from low-quality studies suggested this was possible.  The only way to resolve the question would be to perform a double-blind “sham control” study of stents: giving half of the patients a fake stent and the other half a real stent, with both doctors and patients unaware of (or “blinded” to) which procedure they were involved with. Since we know medical procedures can produce a strong placebo effect, this kind of study could tease out whether it was the stent that was reducing patients’ pain or a placebo effect produced by the operation.  But no one had ever done a double-blind sham-control study — the gold standard of evidence for medical device studies — on stents in stable chest pain patients, until this new Lancet paper.  How researchers used a fake operation to test whether stenting works  The authors of the Lancet paper enrolled 230 patients with stable angina and at least one narrowed coronary vessel. For six weeks, they made sure the patients were getting the best medical treatment for angina, like beta blockers or long-acting nitroglycerine.  What came next rarely happens in medical device trials (and it’s why cardiologists are applauding this study): They gave half the patients a sham stent. So after the six-week startup phase, where patients were stabilized with medications, 195 of them were randomly assigned to get either a stent in their clogged artery or a sham stent procedure. The study was double-blinded — again, the patients and doctors didn’t know which procedure they were involved in — to reduce the risk of bias.  The doctors then followed up with their patients after another six weeks. The main outcome they were interested in was how much time each group could spend exercising on a treadmill, since angina often acts up with exertion. (They also looked at other secondary endpoints, such as changes in oxygen uptake and the severity of chest pain.) By the end of the study, the researchers found there were no clinically important differences between the real stent group and the sham stent group.  So actual stents didn’t outperform the placebo stents. “It’s just like a sugar pill,” said University of California San Francisco cardiologist Rita Redberg. “We know sugar pills make a lot of people feel better — though sugar procedures make even more people feel even better.”  Here’s the most disturbing part: One in 50 stent patients will experience serious complications — such as a heart attack, stroke, bleeding, or even death. So these devices don’t come without risks, and this Lancet paper again suggests they may not be helping patients.  “This should make us take a step back and ask questions about what we are accomplishing for this procedure,” said Yale cardiologist Harlan Krumholz.  David Brown, a Washington University School of Medicine cardiologist who has been studying the effects of stents for a decade, said he wasn’t surprised by the findings.  “[Stenting stable patients] is based on a simplistic 20th-century conceptualization of the disease,” he said. “It’s like the artery is a clogged pipe and if you relieve those blockages, the water will flow freely.” But this study suggests most patients’ pain symptoms may actually be coming from disease in their smaller blood vessels, not from blockages in the large coronary vessels that are always the targets for stents, he added.  In an editorial that accompanied the Lancet paper, Brown and Redberg wrote that medical guidelines need to change so that stenting for stable angina is only recommended as a last resort. “Patients should also be told that sham controlled trials don’t show any benefit,” Brown added.  This study speaks to a much bigger problem with medical evidence  The study represents the best available evidence on the impact of stenting for pain in stable angina patients — and could eventually avert unnecessary, costly procedures in the future. But the study is also important for what it says about the quality of medical evidence doctors often rely on to make decisions.  “This is a great example of a device that got on the market without ever having a high-quality trial behind it,” Redberg says. “For 40 years, we have been doing this procedure without any evidence that it’s better than a sham procedure.”  Right now, medical devices are less rigorously regulated than drugs: Only 1 percent of medical devices get FDA approval with high-quality clinical trials behind them. Even in these cases, devices typically reach the market based on data from a single small, short-term trial, Redberg wrote in a 2014 editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, where she called for a sham control study of stents.  The new Lancet study demonstrates why this kind of investigation is so critical in medicine. “The results of ORBITA show (once again) why regulatory agencies, the medical profession, and the public must demand high-quality studies before the approval and adoption of new therapies,” Redberg and Brown wrote in their recent editorial. Right now this isn’t happening. And stents surely aren’t the only device patients may be getting that are more placebo than proven, and have potentially deadly side effects.",4.333333333333333,3,"[3.5, 5.0, 4.5]"

Korea sanctions,"In this Sept. 11, 2017 photo, Chinese custom officials inspect trucks loaded with goods to and from North Korea in Dandong in northeast China's Liaoning province. For Chinese traders, new United Nations sanctions on North Korea are a disaster. Business in the Chinese border city of Dandong has all but dried up as Chinese traders are unable to collect payment from impoverished North Korean state companies for goods such as toothpaste, instant noodles and other household items. Large-scale trade involving North Korean iron ore and coal has been banned entirely, dealing a big blow to Dandong’s port, whose operator defaulted on a $150 million corporate bond. (Chinatopix via AP)  BEIJING (AP) — For Yu Kaiguang, harsh new United Nations sanctions on North Korea are a disaster.  The trader in the Chinese border city of Dandong has seen business all but dry up, and he spends his days scrambling to obtain payment from the suddenly broke North Korean state companies to whom he sold on credit.  “They have no money to pay us in cash, and the worst is that because of sanctions they can’t settle the bill with goods such as coal, as they did in the past,” said Yu, reached by telephone at the offices of his Dandong Gaoli Trading Company.  Yu said he’s owed about $1 million in all for deliveries of toothpaste, instant noodles and other household items. He’s trying to avoid laying off staff by continuing to export foodstuffs such as pine nuts and red beans. “If they become unemployed, it would be bad for both the state and society.”  Yu’s plight appears increasingly commonplace across Dandong, where the bulk of the cross-border trade is handled. Interviews with four trading companies and recent media reports indicate Chinese companies are hurting in a city where North Korean trucks used to rumble across the Yalu River bridge several times a week delivering metal scrap and returning with everything from televisions to toilet bowls.  The owner of another firm, Dandong Baoquan Commerce and Trade Co., which used to import iron ore and coal and export basic consumer goods, said he was still owed around $200,000 by his North Korea clients.  “I had to lay off about 10 staffers, but I had no other choice because it was the government policy,” Han Lixin said, referring to the sanctions. “I’m still in business hoping to trade with other countries, but it takes a lot of time and efforts to develop customers.”  Large-scale trade involving North Korean resources such as iron ore and coal has been banned entirely under the sanctions, dealing a big blow to Dandong’s port, whose operator defaulted on a $150 million corporate bond this week in part because of cratering revenues.  “The sanctions have a broad effect, and both the economies of North Korea and China are suffering a lot,” said Jin Qiangyi, professor at the Institute of Northeast Asia Studies at Yanbian University in Northeast China. “Chinese companies doing business with North Korea may see quite a lot of losses, and the companies that have already invested in North Korea will suffer more.”  Dealing with North Korean companies was never easy. Wang Chengpeng, former manager of Dandong Hongwei Trading Company, quit doing business with the North entirely because of hassles, restrictions and low-profit margins, even before the latest sanctions began to bite.  Despite that, China has long been the North’s biggest economic partner. Beijing accounted for more than 90 percent of its neighbor’s foreign trade of about $6.5 billion in 2016, according to the South Korean-owned Korea Trade Investment Promotion Agency. China continues to be a key source of food and fuel aid to help keep North Korea’s weak economy from collapsing, and Chinese officials say they won’t agree to measures that could cut off basic life necessities and possibly cause Kim Jong Un’s dictatorship to topple.  China’s patience with Kim has grown increasingly thin, however, and Beijing has lent its support to increasingly tough resolutions unanimously approved by the Security Council this year that target North Korea’s economy in response to its ballistic missile launches and latest nuclear test.  China has said it sees sanctions purely as a means of inducing North Korea to return to nuclear disarmament talks and has rejected unilateral measures not approved by the Security Council, of which it is one of the five veto-wielding permanent members.  Still, despite some allegations of cheating, China appears to be seeking to enforce the sanctions that also ban exports of lead, textiles and seafood, prohibit joint ventures, and bar any country from authorizing new permits for North Korean workers — all sources of hard currency for Pyongyang.  The sanctions have also blacklisted a number of firms in the extraction and financial industries, imposed travel bans and frozen the assets of some government officials, banned the import of natural gas liquids and condensates, and capped the country’s crude oil imports.  It’s hard to gauge the exact impact of sanctions on the North Korean economy because the crucial food and energy sectors are less likely to be hurt by external conditions, said Lee Seok-ki, a senior researcher at the South Korean government-run Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade.  However, while the North’s economy has been expanding — by 3.9 percent in 2016, according to an estimate by the Bank of Korea in South Korea — that rate almost certainly can’t be sustained if sanctions continue, Lee said.  China for its part is watching North Korea to see how its ally will respond to the new measures, eager for signs of a shift in tactics by Kim and an improvement in relations between Beijing and Pyongyang that have “sunk into a standstill,” as Jin puts it.  In that context, Kim’s message of congratulation to President Xi Jinping upon his reappointment as leader of China’s ruling Communist Party last week is being cautiously viewed as a possible indication of change.  “There has been a calm from the North Korean side for about a month, and we are not sure whether it is because of the excessive pressure they are under or their miscalculation on China’s determination,” Jin said. “It’s still too early to say.”  ___  Associated Press writer Lee Youkyung in Seoul, South Korea, contributed to this report.",3.2142857142857144,14,"[4.5, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 4.0, 4.0, 2.5, 1.0, 0.5, 3.0, 4.0, 4.0, 2.5, 4.0]"

Governors of 19 Western states are pressing the federal government to do more to prevent the spread of damage-causing invasive mussels from infected federally managed waterways. (AP Photo/Felicia Fonseca, File)  BOISE, Idaho (AP) — Governors of 19 Western states are pressing the federal government to do more to prevent the spread of damage-causing invasive mussels from infected federally managed waterways.  The Western Governors’ Association on Thursday sent a letter urging Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to put in place by spring 2018 controls to prevent the spread of zebra and quagga mussels.  The governors are also asking that federal agencies conduct mandatory inspections and decontamination of boats leaving infected water bodies. The mussels can attach to boats and trailers and travel long distances, clogging water pipes, damaging boat motors and affecting other aquatic life.  “Given the significant risks that quagga and zebra mussels pose to uninfested waterbodies, it is critical to implement effective control policies in a timely manner,” the letter states.  The governors say they’re particularly concerned about the mussels reaching the Columbia River Basin, Lake Tahoe, and the Colorado River Basin above Lake Powell.  The Interior Department has said that hydroelectric projects infested with the mussels might require an additional $500,000 in annual maintenance. The Pacific Northwest gets much of its power from hydro projects, so an infestation could increase the cost of electricity.  Many states have spent millions and continue to do so to keep the mussels out. Some have set up mandatory checkpoints near borders to intercept boats for inspections, including Idaho, which is spending more than $3 million annually.  “Idaho and our neighbors in the West are acting individually and collaboratively to address the challenge of these invasive species,” Idaho Gov. C.L. “Butch” Otter said in a statement to The Associated Press on Friday. “Now our federal partners must step up to help us stop further infestations.”  Heather Swift, Interior Department spokeswoman, said in an email to The Associated Press on Friday that Zinke hadn’t seen the letter and couldn’t comment specifically.  “Stopping the spread of invasive species is a big concern of the Department and the Secretary,” she said, noting a June 26 news release outlining some of the agency’s collaborative efforts with states and tribal agencies.  The governors’ letter on Thursday is the second they’ve sent this year about invasive mussels to Zinke. A letter sent June 22 also pressed for watercraft inspection and decontamination.  The Interior Department responded Sept. 15 with a two-page letter agreeing with the severity of the problem. The most recent letter by the governors’ included “clarifying questions.”  Specifically, the governors want to know what timeline has been set for the National Park Service to complete an assessment of mussel containment and monitoring programs at Lake Mead National Recreation Area in southeastern Nevada and northwestern Arizona, and the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area in southern Utah and northern Arizona.  The governors are also interested in knowing if similar timelines are being set for other Interior Department agencies, including the Bureau of Land Management and Bureau of Reclamation.  The governors also asked if federal agencies have the authority to require mandatory boat checks and, if not, what authority would be needed.  “Western states need adequate measures to ensure these invaders do not spread to uninfested waters,” the governors said.",3.8181818181818183,11,"[5.0, 2.5, 3.0, 2.5, 4.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 3.0, 4.0, 4.0]"
1472,3124,11,3,2017,2017-11-03,Vox,Daylight saving time ended Sunday: 6 things to know about “falling back”,"On Sunday, at 2 am, clocks turned back one hour, heralding the end of daylight saving time for much of the country. The change shifted daylight back into the morning hours. For 9-to-5 office workers, it means saying goodbye to leaving work while it’s still light out. And for weekend workers, it meant an additional glorious hour of sleep on Sunday.  And yet there’s a lot of confusion about daylight saving time.  The first thing to know: Yes, it ends in the fall, just as the decrease in daylight hours starts to become noticeable.  Let’s sort it all out.  1) Why do we need to “save” daylight hours in the summer?  Daylight saving time in the US started as an energy conservation trick during World War I, and became a national standard in the 1960s. The idea is to shift the number of daylight hours we get into the evening. So if the sun sets at 8 pm instead of 7 pm, we’d presumably spend less time with the lights on in our homes at night, saving on electricity.  It also means that you’re less likely to sleep through daylight hours in the morning (since those are shifted an hour later too). Hence “saving” daylight hours for the most productive time of the day.  Overall: We agree, the name is kind of confusing.  2) Isn’t it “daylight savings time” not “daylight saving time”?  No, it’s definitely called “daylight saving time.” Not plural.  3) Does it actually lead to energy savings?  As Joseph Stromberg outlined in an excellent 2015 Vox article, the presumed electricity conservation from the time change is unclear or nonexistent:  Despite the fact that daylight saving time was introduced to save fuel, there isn't strong evidence that the current system actually reduces energy use — or that making it year-round would do so, either. Studies that evaluate the energy impact of DST are mixed. It seems to reduce lighting use (and thus electricity consumption) slightly but may increase heating and AC use, as well as gas consumption. It's probably fair to say that energy-wise, it's a wash.  4) What would happen if daylight saving time were abolished? Or if it were extended forever?  Currently, the state of Massachusetts is in the early stages of considering a proposal to stay on daylight saving time year round. It involves shifting into Atlantic time — which is an hour ahead of Eastern time — and then staying there the whole year. (Atlantic “standard” time, and Eastern “saving” time are the same.)  The plan is a long shot. The Boston Globe explains that the Massachusetts legislature and the Department of Transportation would both have to approve it. And similar bills have failed in Maine, New Hampshire, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. But its proponents say Massachusetts would benefit by having more sunlight hours in the afternoon and evening throughout the year.  And it wouldn’t be the only state to not observe the changing of the clocks. Much of Arizona currently ignores saving time.  But why stop at Massachusetts? It’s worth thinking about what would happen if Congress abolished daylight saving time (or kept it going all year long).  Blogger and cartographer Andy Woodruff decided to visualize this with an excellent series of maps.  The goal of these maps is to show how abolishing daylight saving time, extending it all year, or going with the status quo changes the amount of days we have “reasonable” sunrise and sunset times.  Reasonable, as defined by Woodruff, is the sun rising at 7 am or earlier or setting after 5 pm (so one could, conceivably, spend some time in the sun before or after work).  This is what the map looks like under the status quo of twice-yearly clock shifts. A lot of people have unreasonable sunrise times (the dark spots) for much of the year:  Here's how things would change if daylight saving were abolished (that is, if we just stuck to the time set in the winter all year). It’s better, particularly on the sunrise end:  And here's what would happen if daylight saving were always in effect. The sunrise situation would actually be worse for most people. But many more people would enjoy after-work light — and there’s a strong argument to make that this after-work light is actually worth more. (More on that below.)  (Note: The length of light we experience each day wouldn't actually change; that's determined by the tilt of Earth's axis. But we would experience it in times more accommodating for our modern world.

In 2015, Stromberg made the compelling case that the daylight saving time shift into the evening should be extended year-round. Having more light later could benefit us in a surprising number of ways:  People engage in more leisure activities after work than beforehand, so we’d likely do more physical activity over sedentary leisure activities. Relatedly, studies show that kids get more exercise when the sun is out later in the evening.  Stromberg also cites some evidence that robberies decrease when there’s more sun in the evening hours.  There could be economic gains, since people “take short trips, and buy things after work — but not before — so a longer DST slightly increases sales,” Stromberg writes.  5) Is daylight saving time dangerous?  A little bit. In the spring time, when we shift clocks forward one hour, many of us will lose that hour of sleep. In the days after daylight saving time starts, our biological clocks are a little bit off. It’s like the whole country has been given one hour of jet lag.  One hour of lost sleep sounds like a small change, but we humans are fragile, sensitive animals. Small disruptions in our sleep have been shown to alter basic indicators of our health and dull our mental edge.  And when our biological clocks are off, everything about us is out of sync. Our bodies run this tight schedule to try to keep up with our actions. Since we usually eat a meal after waking up, we produce the most insulin in the morning. We're primed to metabolize breakfast before even taking a bite. It's more efficient that way.  (There’s some good research that finds taking over-the-counter melatonin helps reset our body clocks to a new time. Read more about that here).  Being an hour off schedule means our bodies are not prepared for the actions we partake in at any time of the day.  One example: driving.  In 1999, researchers at Johns Hopkins and Stanford universities wanted to find out what happens on the road when millions of drivers have their sleep disrupted.  Analyzing 21 years of fatal car crash data from the US National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, they found a very small, but significant, increase in road deaths on the Monday after the clock shift in the spring: The number of deadly accidents jumped to an average of 83.5 on the ""spring forward"" Monday compared with an average of 78.2 on a typical Monday.  And it seems it's not just car accidents. Evidence has also mounted of an increase in incidences of workplace injuries and heart attacks in the days after we spring forward.  6) How can we end daylight saving time, or extend it all year round?  That’s easy! Well, not really: All it would take is an act of Congress. But given the current pace of major legislation, I wouldn’t count on this happening anytime soon.",4.416666666666667,6,"[4.0, 5.0, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.0]"
1370,2973,11,3,2017,2017-11-03,Vox,Thousands of heart patients get stents that may do more harm than good,"There’s an epidemic of unnecessary medical treatments, as David Epstein of ProPublica recently documented in a terrific investigation: Doctors routinely perform procedures that aren’t based on high-quality research, or even in spite of evidence that contradicts their use.  One of the prime examples of a dubious treatment that Epstein and others have pointed to is cardiologists putting little mesh tubes called stents in patients with stable angina — chest pain caused by clogged coronary arteries that arises only with physical exertion or emotional stress.  Doctors insert the devices into narrowed or blocked arteries to pop them open, helping blood flow to the heart again. The idea is that stents should help soothe the suffering of patients with angina (or chest pain) and drive down the risk of a heart attack and death in the future.  But studies show that stable angina can be well controlled with medication. And researchers have found that stenting chest pain patients doesn’t help them live longer or reduce their risk of disease — in fact, heart attacks and strokes can be potentially deadly side effects of stent procedures. There’s also been a lingering question about whether stents truly work to relieve pain.  Now, researchers from the United Kingdom have published a high-quality study in the Lancet that helps answer the pain question. Building on years of lower-quality evidence, the well-designed study suggests stents may in fact be useless for pain in people with stable angina who are being treated with medication.  ""Surprisingly, even though the stents improved blood supply, they didn't provide more relief of symptoms compared to drug treatments, at least in this patient group,"" said Rasha Al-Lamee, lead author of the study and a researcher at the National Heart and Lung Institute at Imperial College London, in a statement. This doesn’t mean stents should never be used in stable chest pain patients — some patients can’t take the medications that control angina, for example — but doctors may want to consider inserting these devices as a last resort.  Considering 500,000 patients get stents for stable angina each year in the US and Europe alone, and the devices can cost up to $67,000, depending on the hospital and a patient’s insurance coverage, the Lancet paper is poised to shake up cardiology, as the New York Times reported.  The trial is also important for another big reason: It raises critical questions about the quality of evidence doctors rely on to make life-and-death decisions for their patients.  The controversy over stents for patients with stable chest pain  Over the years, studies have been piling up that suggest stenting stable angina patients may not actually be all that helpful.  A decade ago, researchers published a study in the New England Journal of Medicine showing that stents did not improve patients’ mortality risk or cardiovascular disease outcomes. Since then, meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials on stents in stable angina patients have similarly found the devices don’t outperform more conservative medical therapies (such as medication) when it comes to preventing heart attacks or extending patients’ life expectancy in the long term.  There was still a question about using stents in stable patients, whether the devices could relieve chest pain in the shorter term. Data from low-quality studies suggested this was possible.  The only way to resolve the question would be to perform a double-blind “sham control” study of stents: giving half of the patients a fake stent and the other half a real stent, with both doctors and patients unaware of (or “blinded” to) which procedure they were involved with. Since we know medical procedures can produce a strong placebo effect, this kind of study could tease out whether it was the stent that was reducing patients’ pain or a placebo effect produced by the operation.  But no one had ever done a double-blind sham-control study — the gold standard of evidence for medical device studies — on stents in stable chest pain patients, until this new Lancet paper.  How researchers used a fake operation to test whether stenting works  The authors of the Lancet paper enrolled 230 patients with stable angina and at least one narrowed coronary vessel. For six weeks, they made sure the patients were getting the best medical treatment for angina, like beta blockers or long-acting nitroglycerine.  What came next rarely happens in medical device trials (and it’s why cardiologists are applauding this study): They gave half the patients a sham stent. So after the six-week startup phase, where patients were stabilized with medications, 195 of them were randomly assigned to get either a stent in their clogged artery or a sham stent procedure. The study was double-blinded — again, the patients and doctors didn’t know which procedure they were involved in — to reduce the risk of bias.  The doctors then followed up with their patients after another six weeks. The main outcome they were interested in was how much time each group could spend exercising on a treadmill, since angina often acts up with exertion. (They also looked at other secondary endpoints, such as changes in oxygen uptake and the severity of chest pain.) By the end of the study, the researchers found there were no clinically important differences between the real stent group and the sham stent group.  So actual stents didn’t outperform the placebo stents. “It’s just like a sugar pill,” said University of California San Francisco cardiologist Rita Redberg. “We know sugar pills make a lot of people feel better — though sugar procedures make even more people feel even better.”  Here’s the most disturbing part: One in 50 stent patients will experience serious complications — such as a heart attack, stroke, bleeding, or even death. So these devices don’t come without risks, and this Lancet paper again suggests they may not be helping patients.  “This should make us take a step back and ask questions about what we are accomplishing for this procedure,” said Yale cardiologist Harlan Krumholz.  David Brown, a Washington University School of Medicine cardiologist who has been studying the effects of stents for a decade, said he wasn’t surprised by the findings.  “[Stenting stable patients] is based on a simplistic 20th-century conceptualization of the disease,” he said. “It’s like the artery is a clogged pipe and if you relieve those blockages, the water will flow freely.” But this study suggests most patients’ pain symptoms may actually be coming from disease in their smaller blood vessels, not from blockages in the large coronary vessels that are always the targets for stents, he added.  In an editorial that accompanied the Lancet paper, Brown and Redberg wrote that medical guidelines need to change so that stenting for stable angina is only recommended as a last resort. “Patients should also be told that sham controlled trials don’t show any benefit,” Brown added.  This study speaks to a much bigger problem with medical evidence  The study represents the best available evidence on the impact of stenting for pain in stable angina patients — and could eventually avert unnecessary, costly procedures in the future. But the study is also important for what it says about the quality of medical evidence doctors often rely on to make decisions.  “This is a great example of a device that got on the market without ever having a high-quality trial behind it,” Redberg says. “For 40 years, we have been doing this procedure without any evidence that it’s better than a sham procedure.”  Right now, medical devices are less rigorously regulated than drugs: Only 1 percent of medical devices get FDA approval with high-quality clinical trials behind them. Even in these cases, devices typically reach the market based on data from a single small, short-term trial, Redberg wrote in a 2014 editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, where she called for a sham control study of stents.  The new Lancet study demonstrates why this kind of investigation is so critical in medicine. “The results of ORBITA show (once again) why regulatory agencies, the medical profession, and the public must demand high-quality studies before the approval and adoption of new therapies,” Redberg and Brown wrote in their recent editorial. Right now this isn’t happening. And stents surely aren’t the only device patients may be getting that are more placebo than proven, and have potentially deadly side effects.",4.25,4,"[5.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5]"
1429,3049,11,3,2017,2017-11-03,The New York Times,Your Race Against Time: How Climate Affects the Marathon,"The interactions between climate and a sport like long-distance running are only going to get more pronounced as the climate changes. Over the last 50 years, the temperature has exceeded 60 degrees on just 5 percent of the days during the first week of November, when the New York race is typically held. By 2050, this is projected to rise to 18 percent of days, and by 2090 it is expected to be 38 percent.  How will runners and organizers react? National governments, city planners and large corporations are all realizing that a warmer world will force them to change the ways they do business.  Marathons will be no exception. The organizers of the New York race will probably not want their event to be one where it is difficult, or perhaps even impossible, for people to set their personal best or to lower the world record. So they may want to adapt by moving the marathon to later in the year.  At the same time, runners may switch from the New York City Marathon to others held in cooler climates to find the perfect temperature at just the right time of year. Could a Montreal Marathon be among the world’s most prestigious by 2050?  Athletic equipment companies will surely develop new technologies to aid adaptation as well. For runners, the breathable mesh and cooling towels of today could easily be traded in for shirts with built-in air-conditioners. Seem far-fetched? They already exist. Indeed, I was one of the authors of a recent study of just how powerful a role technology can play in helping people adapt to warmer temperatures. For example, the rise of air-conditioning has reduced the mortality consequences of extremely hot days in the United States by more than 70 percent since 1960.  Marathons and marathon runners appear likely to be able to adapt to climate change with relative ease through changes in when, where and how. But in many other areas of our lives, the costs of climate change are expected to be greater. More intense hurricanes, and the increased occurrence of extremely hot days, will elevate risks to life and property, which can only be offset through costly adaptation efforts. These include building more expensive housing, accelerating the deployment of air-conditioning and making painful decisions to move away from current homes — as well as acceptance of increased risks.  In this way, the climate choice in front of us is similar to the one faced by people training for a marathon. More time spent training makes for a faster marathon. It’s not a great idea to show up on the day of the race without having invested much in your performance. The time for that is well in advance of the big day.  In the case of climate change, we can devote resources now to reducing greenhouse gas emissions so that we face lower costs in the future. As with so many things in life, both marathons and the climate problem are subject to an old rule — no pain, no gain.",3.5,4,"[4.0, 1.5, 5.0, 3.5]"
1412,3030,11,3,2017,2017-11-03,Associated Press News,Boston College announces $150M expansion in the sciences," Boston College is betting big on the sciences.  The private Jesuit school, better known for its philosophy and economics programs, unveiled plans Friday for a $150 million science facility that will bring a new engineering major to campus.  School officials are calling it an ambitious step forward that combines the college’s longstanding strength in the liberal arts with its newer expansion into the sciences.  The crowning jewel of the 150,000-square-foot (13,935-square-meter) facility will be a new integrated science institute named after Apple executive Phil Schiller and his wife, Kim Gassett-Schiller, who donated $25 million for the project.  Schiller, a 1982 graduate of the school, said the institute aims to give scholars from the humanities and the sciences a place to team up on major global problems.  “This is where the best work comes from, as diverse minds with different experiences try to understand a problem together and solve things as a team,” said Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing. “That is where big leaps forward happen.”  Construction is scheduled to begin in spring 2019 at the school’s campus west of Boston. It will add research laboratories, classrooms and space for students and faculty to collaborate across disciplines.  It also will bring a new engineering major to campus as the school seeks an edge in competition with other major universities.  The new facility is Boston College’s latest step in a recent push toward the sciences. Last year, it became one of 115 universities in the U.S. designated as a top research institution by the Carnegie Foundation, which classifies schools based on their research spending and staffing levels, among other factors.  The shift follows in the steps of other private schools that have pursued aggressive expansions into science and research fields, which can add prestige — and a source of revenue— for universities.  Nearby Harvard University is continuing work on a $1 billion science and engineering complex in Boston’s Allston neighborhood after the project was put on hold amid an economic slump in 2010.  North Carolina’s Wake Forest University also introduced a new engineering program this year, blending a science curriculum with the private school’s liberal arts tradition.  At Boston College, officials say the new Schiller institute aims to tackle projects ranging from the development of clean energy to technology that can diagnose and treat humans in poor areas around the world.  The school enrolls about 15,000 students at its campus west of Boston. Last year it had the No. 40 largest endowment among U.S. colleges, valued at nearly $2.1 billion, according to an annual study by the National Association of College and University Business Officers.  School President William Leahy thanked Schiller for the donation on Friday, saying it will “have a profound effect on the university’s ability to address pressing societal needs through advanced scientific research.”  ___  Follow Collin Binkley on Twitter at @cbinkley",5.0,1,[5.0]

1408,3024,11,3,2017,2017-11-03,Vox,Bowe Bergdahl isn’t going to prison,"A military judge just ruled that Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, the US Army soldier who disappeared from his base in Afghanistan in 2009 and ended up captured by the Taliban, won’t serve any jail time — even though he pleaded guilty on October 16.  However, Bergdahl received a dishonorable discharge from the Army, which means he won’t get health benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs. Bergdahl also had his rank reduced from sergeant to private, the lowest Army rank. Finally, he will have to pay $1,000 per month for the next 10 months.  Thus concludes one of the most high-profile US military trials in recent memory. Bergdahl has been in the public eye since 2014, when then-President Barack Obama negotiated a prisoner swap with the Taliban that freed him in exchange for the release of five Taliban-linked prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay. It was a controversial decision that drew the ire of members of Congress, especially Republicans.  Donald Trump made it a campaign issue in 2016, calling Bergdahl a “traitor,” even suggesting that he should be executed. About an hour after the ruling by a military judge, Trump tweeted his thoughts: “The decision on Sergeant Bergdahl is a complete and total disgrace to our Country and to our Military.”  Bergdahl’s case was also the subject the second season of the podcast Serial, which focused entirely on uncovering the truth about the sergeant and his disappearance.  It’s expected that both military personnel and civilians will be upset with this decision, but Bergdahl is surely relived he isn’t headed to prison.  The drama isn’t over  The Bergdahl drama started on June 30, 2009, when he disappeared and told no one in his unit where he went. Military prosecutors alleged that Bergdahl committed the crime of desertion — meaning abandoning his post with no intention of returning — and something called “misbehavior before the enemy,” which means putting soldiers at unnecessary risk by forcing them to search for him in hostile territory in the weeks after his disappearance.  My colleague Zack Beauchamp explained in October why that was a hard case for prosecutors to make:  According to Bergdahl’s own account, confirmed by an internal military investigation led by Maj. Gen. Kenneth Dahl, Bergdahl’s goal wasn’t to disappear into the Afghan wilderness or (as Trump alleged) turn traitor and defect to the Taliban. Instead, he had a plan to blow the whistle on (apparently largely imagined) ""officer incompetence"" and mismanagement in his unit. He aimed to run across 20 miles of hostile territory to get to a forward operating base (FOB) called Sharana and inform the general there about what was going on. He also planned to report and uncover new intelligence on the Taliban. “When I got back to the FOB, you know, they could say, ‘You left your position,"" he said in comments aired on Serial. ""But I could say: ‘Well, I also got this information. So what are you going to do?’""  Bergdahl’s defense team claimed he had mental illness at the time he vanished. ""Hypothetically, he probably should not have been in the Army,"" Capt. Nina Banks, one of Bergdahl's lawyers, said in her closing argument. Dr. Charles Morgan, a forensic psychiatrist, testified on Wednesday that Bergdahl did have mental problems, including “schizotypal personality disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.”  However, Bergdahl still pleaded guilty last month, which may have factored into military judge Army Col. Jeffery Nance’s decision to hand down such a lenient sentence. Gen. Robert Abrams will now review Nance’s ruling. Abrams has the power to ease the punishment further, but not make it more severe.  That means the Bergdahl case isn’t officially over yet — and neither is the drama.",3.75,4,"[4.0, 3.5, 4.5, 3.0]"
1407,3022,11,3,2017,2017-11-03,Vox,The Republican tax plan raises taxes on families who adopt children,"“We must continue to remove barriers to adoption whenever we can,” President Donald Trump wrote in a proclamation to declare November National Adoption Month, “so that the love and care of prospective adoptive parents can be directed to children waiting for their permanent homes.”  That sentiment, apparently, did not translate into the House GOP’s tax overhaul bill. The proposal, unveiled Thursday, eliminates the adoption tax credit, which exists to help reduce financial barriers to adoption. The credit essentially helps subsidize costs — sometimes in the tens of thousands for private or international adoptions — for agency and attorney fees, travel, and post-adoption services, such as retrofitting a home for a child with special needs.  But adoption advocates had been bracing for the end of this credit. In December, House Ways and Means Chair Kevin Brady (R-TX), one of the architects of the tax overhaul bill who is also a father to adopted kids, spoke at the Heritage Foundation about tax reform, and he mentioned the adoption tax credit as an example of a provision that could be eliminated. Michaela Sims, a lobbyist and spokesperson for the Save the Adoption Tax Credit working group, said these organizations had feared this since Brady’s speech. But, she told me, “when I saw that in black and white today, it positively took my breath away.”  “It’s stunning to me that this package that is supposed to be pro-family eliminates the adoption tax credit, which is definitely not pro-family,” Sims added. “At the minimum, it’s a tax increase for families who choose to adopt. But at maximum, it could have a chilling effect on adoption.”  Republicans first championed the “pro-family” adoption tax credit  The adoption tax credit was created as part of the Small Business and Job Protection Act of 1996. The legislation won bipartisan support, and President Bill Clinton signed it into law. But the idea for the credit emerged from Republican Newt Gingrich’s 1994 “Contract With America.” The Family Reinforcement Act, as it was named, called for “tax incentives for adoption,” among other proposals.  Republican Susan Molinari, a former representative from Staten Island who sponsored one version of the adoption tax credit in the House, commented to the New York Times in 1996 about Clinton’s backing of this and other social policies: ""It's President Clinton starting to get in shape to sound like candidate Clinton again with several conservative pro-family positions staked out.""  What is the adoption tax credit exactly?  The tax credit Clinton signed offered up to a $5,000 credit to families, or $6,000 for those who adopted a child with special needs. The credit has gone through a few iterations since then. In 2017, adoptive households were eligible for a maximum credit of $13,570. (The amount now adjusts annually for inflation.) Most foster, private, or international adoptions are eligible — but only for taxpayers below a certain income limit. According to the Tax Policy Center, in 2017 the credit starts phasing out for households earning $203,540 and cuts off completely for those with incomes of $243,540 and higher.  Yet households that are solidly middle and upper middle class tend to benefit the most from this adoption tax credit. According to IRS data from 2014, taxpayers with incomes between $100,000 and $200,000 represented 35 percent of all filers and were awarded about 60 percent of all tax credit dollars.  As that chart above makes clear, lower and lower middle class households often don’t reap the tax incentives of adoption. That’s because the credit is currently nonrefundable, which means if adoptive parents don’t earn enough to owe federal taxes, they aren’t eligible. In 2010 and 2011, a provision in the Affordable Care Act actually made the adoption tax credit refundable, allowing families to get the credit even if they didn’t owe taxes. That all changed, again, with the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which made the credits permanent (well, “permanent”) but nonrefundable.  Adoption advocates have been fighting to make these credits refundable once again — and lawmakers have introduced bipartisan bills in the House and Senate this year to do just that. Now these groups are battling to save it.  “Penny wise, pound foolish”  The number claiming the adoption tax credit is relatively tiny — just 0.005 percent of all taxpayers in 2014. That same year, the average credit for each taxpayer was $4,802 across all income levels. (The max credit was $13,190 in 2014.) Which means getting rid of the nonrefundable adoption tax credit will likely add up to just a few hundred million dollars in government savings.  And that’s a savings that could end up costing the government in the long term, specifically when it comes to foster care adoptions, said Mary Eschelbach Hansen, an expert in US social policy and economics professor at American University. “My work has shown that a dollar spent to support adoption of kids from US foster care returns $3 in benefits to society,” she said. A large portion of that comes through government savings, she explained — “things like reduced criminal justice, reduced special education that accrue to the children who are removed from, by definition, to insecure foster care to secure families.”  “Ditching that tax credit is penny wise and pound foolish,” Hansen added. “That’s the most essential thing to understand about this proposed change. Every dollar you save in tax credits now is going to cost you dollars somewhere else.”  Richard Barth, the dean of the University of Maryland School of Social Work has done similar research, which showed that kids who remain in foster care saddle the federal and state governments with significantly higher costs — an amount that’s much higher than the relatively modest tax cuts. “Adoptive families are a huge resource,” Barth said, “The tax credit is an investment in attracting them to a long and arduous and sometimes quite expensive role as parents.”  Of course, Hansen emphasized that this applies for kids adopted out of the foster care system, rather than private or international adoptions. Public adoptions are not as costly upfront (and some families are eligible for ongoing assistance), but those kids tend to be older and more likely to have special needs that can strain finances, Hansen explained. The tax credit frees up money for services like special education or occupational therapy — things insurance doesn’t always cover. “It’s not only they’re less likely to be adopted,” Hansen said of getting rid of the credit, “it’s that if they are adopted, they’re less likely to get the services they need if parents don’t have the adoption-year financial support. If you kick that can down the road, it can have bad consequences for the overall success of the adoption.”  The adoption tax credit probably doesn’t go far enough — but getting rid of it altogether would be worse  Bringing kids from foster care to stable homes generally yields a net positive — for the individual kids, and for society at large. Private and international adoptions may work differently, but the idea itself — providing a kid a stable home — should be pretty uncontroversial. And that private adoption process can easily put a financial strain on families, with the cost spiking as high as $30,000 said Josh Kroll, a project coordinator of the Adoption Subsidy Resource Center at the North American Council on Adoptable Children. Some families have to take out loans to meet those costs. “This,” Kroll said of the credit, “would help them repay that quicker.”  Experts say those benefits would be even more substantial if the credit were refundable — which, again, would mean taxpayers could get the full amount of credit, regardless of how much they owe in taxes. The same goes for families who adopt from foster care: According to a 2011 study from the Department of Health and Human Services, about half of those adopting kids from foster care are low-income families — which means they might not be able to take full advantage of the adoption credit in its current form. A refundable credit would also help families adopt more than one child at once, keeping siblings together and the family unit intact.  Which is why advocates, even as they weren’t shocked by the GOP’s latest tax reform plan, were staging a fight to make that credit refundable. Two separate bills were introduced in the Senate and the House this year. The House bill is sponsored by Rep. Diane Black (R-TN), who also now supports the GOP tax plan that would nix the credit entirely.

Brady told the Washington Post that the adoption tax credit in its current form wasn’t working because families didn’t earn enough to qualify, or didn’t itemize, and that the new plan would give “families more in their paychecks.” The GOP tax overhaul does outline a modest increase to the child tax credit, which would benefit adoptive parents — but only after the fact. Sims said that increase was great but not enough. “We’re talking about kids not having a home and not having a permanent family,” she said. “Last time I checked, that was very pro-family.”  The consequences of cutting the adoption tax credit are still hard to predict — and the bill remains just that. “We don’t know what the final thing will look like. It’s hard to say,” Kroll said. “It will probably make it harder for lower- and middle-income families to adopt, especially privately and internationally. That’s the thing that’s probably the clearest.”  Baber called the elimination of this tax credit a significant loss for the adoption community. “The question is,” he said, “who’s not going to be adopted because of it?”",3.3,5,"[3.0, 2.5, 4.5, 4.0, 2.5]"

Tesla (OTC: TSLA) has only made a profit in one quarter of its 14-year existence, and that was only due to selling federal and state tax credits to traditional auto manufactures and others that actually do make taxable profits.  Although Tesla’s $2.98 billion third quarter revenue slightly beat Wall Street analysts’ estimates, the company lost $671 million, or $2.92 per share. That was twice the-$336 million loss in the prior quarter, and set an all-time cash burn high of $16 million per day.  Breitbart News reported in early October that CEO Elon Musk had announced that Tesla Inc. had its “all-time best quarter” with record deliveries of 26,150 vehicles, including 14,065 Model S sedans; 11,865 Model X SUVs; and 220 Model 3 economy cars. That was considered a disappointment for Model 3 deliveries, and its stock sold off by 1 percent.  But Musk emphasized that through “physics-first principles,” Tesla would shape a new mode of industrial production to improve efficiency by “factors of 10 or even 100 times.” He said Tesla’s key advantage in building all-electric vehicles was limiting the number of moving engine parts to 20, versus up to 10,000 for internal combustion engines.  With investors reassured that Tesla was on track to ramp up to delivering 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week in the December quarter and 10,000 per week in the March quarter, Tesla’s stock traded up on big volume to an interim high of $362.55 on October 18.  But the stock opened at $301.15 per share on November 2 and has been trading down after Musk acknowledged on the company’s third quarter conference call that it is “difficult to predict” when the bottlenecks will be cleared in production of Model 3s. He said he did not expect to be at 5,000 Model 3 units a week until late March.  Musk tried to reassure shareholders that he is “leading from the front lines” to battle “production hell” delays. Tesla said the main problem holding up production of the Model 3s were production delays at Tesla’s $5 billion Gigafactory in Reno, Nevada, where Panasonic four-battery cell modules are automatically inserted into an aluminum-wrapped battery case. Musk referred to his Instagram post last week where he is having a late-night campfire with a couple of managers on the Gigafactory’s roof as a sign of his focus.  Musk did assign some blame for production delays on the Model 3 being more automated, compared to the company’s largely hand-built luxury Model S sedans and Model X SUVs. Musk stated that “bringing this level of automation online is simply challenging in the early stages of the ramp.”  But he failed to comment on Edward Niedermeyer’s brilliant October 30 report in the Daily Kanban industrial blog that Tesla did not give a purchase order to a major automated tooling supplier to develop two “Body in White” (BIW) transfer lines for the Model 3 early this year. Although car companies normally place fully-designed orders for BIW lines with at least a two-year lead time, and BIW manufacturers almost always assemble and test the line at their factories, Tesla asked for a 4-month delivery and wanted to expedite delivery by doing a risky “cold build” line layout and quality testing at Tesla’s factory.  Niedermeyer added that “disagreements between Tesla’s designers and engineers resulted in numerous revisions to the scope of the contract and eventually led Tesla to drop the second line from its purchase order.” The BIW vendor blamed Tesla’s high level of turnover in key positions, which Breitbart News has highlighted in the past. Without the second BIW assembly line, Tesla can never produce 10,000 units per week.  In another example of Tesla failing to have enough lead time to produce Model 3 units, Panasonic’s Chief Executive Kazuhiro Tsuga told Reuters that Gigafactory batteries are still being mostly made by hand. “This process (for battery packs) will be soon automated, and then the number of vehicles to be produced will rise sharply.” Tsuga declined to comment on how far Tesla Model 3 production is behind its targeted delivery schedule.",3.3,5,"[5.0, 2.5, 3.5, 2.5, 3.0]"
1375,2978,11,3,2017,2017-11-03,Associated Press News,3 Things: Yellen’s impact on the Fed and the US economy," In this Sunday, Oct. 15, 2017, file photo, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen speaks during the G30 International Banking Seminar, at Inter-American Development Bank headquarters in Washington. On Wednesday, Nov. 1, 2017, the Federal Reserve releases its latest monetary policy statement after a two-day meeting. ( AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — After she steps down in February, Janet Yellen will go into history books at the first woman to have led the Federal Reserve in its 100-year history. But Yellen, who has earned widespread praise for her stewardship of the Fed, will be remembered for much more than breaking a glass ceiling at the world’s leading central bank.  Here are three areas where Yellen made her mark on the Fed and the U.S. economy:  ___  CRISIS MANAGEMENT  Before becoming the Fed chair in 2014, Yellen served six years as president of the Fed’s San Francisco regional bank and then as vice chair during Ben Bernanke’s second term as Fed chairman from 2010 to 2014. Yellen was among the first Fed officials to recognize the gravity of the risk posed by the subprime mortgage crisis and to grasp the severity of the Great Recession — the worst downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s.  Transcripts of the Fed’s policy meetings during the fall of 2008, when Lehman Brothers’ collapse ignited the scariest phase of the financial crisis and deepened the recession, show that Yellen was a leading advocate for aggressively slashing interest rates to help buttress the financial system and support the economy.  As the recession deepened and millions lost jobs, Yellen was also a vigorous supporter of Bernanke’s drive to take emergency actions that the Fed had never before attempted. With the Fed’s benchmark rate already at a record low near zero, Bernanke, with Yellen’s backing, turned to buying Treasury and mortgage bonds to further drive down long-term borrowing rates. The bond purchases swelled the Fed’s balance sheet five-fold to $4.5 trillion and raised alarms among critics. But the lower rates helped the job market heal and the economy recover.  ___  TRANSITION MANAGEMENT  By the time Yellen took over as Fed chair in February 2014, the recession had ended and the economy had entered its fifth year of expansion. Yet the pace of growth remained anemic. And the job market had yet to recover all of the 9 million jobs that had vanished during the recession.  So Yellen proceeded to guide the Fed to maintain an aggressively stimulative policy, with record-low rates and bond purchases that were intended to hold down long-term loan rates. Some critics, inside and outside the central bank, warned that the Yellen Fed was setting the stage for runaway inflation or dangerous asset bubbles. But Yellen’s approach carried the day. She argued that the frailty of the economy justified maintaining ultra-low borrowing rates.  The Fed kept its benchmark rate near zero until December 2015. Since then, it has raised its rate just four times, each time slightly. In December, economists expect the Fed to raise its benchmark rate again And in October, it began paring its balance sheet with initial small monthly reductions.  Thus far, Yellen’s gamble that the Fed could leave rates at low levels for years longer than some had thought has paid off. The unemployment rate, which peaked at 10 percent in 2009, is now just 4.1 percent — the lowest point since Bill Clinton was president in 2000.  Jerome Powell, the Fed board member whom President Donald Trump tapped to succeed Yellen, is expected to extend Yellen’s policies of gradual modest increases in rates and slight reductions in the Fed’s bond holdings.  ___  HISTORY’S JUDGMENT  Yellen’s belief that rates could stay at record lows because inflation posed no immediate threat has so far proved a winning formula. Inflation, in fact, has stayed chronically too low — below even the Fed’s 2 percent target. And the Fed is forecasting that annual inflation won’t reach 2 percent before 2019.  Some of Yellen’s critics, including conservative Republicans in Congress, remain unbowed. That assert that by refusing to move earlier to normalize Fed rates to shrink the Fed’s bond holdings, Yellen might have elevated the risk of future high inflation or of dangerous bubbles that could form in stocks or other assets. These critics say they fear that a worsening inflation picture might then compel the Fed to raise rates so quickly as to tip the economy into a recession.  Yellen has to hope that future economic trends are kinder to her than they were to one of her predecessors, Alan Greenspan. When he stepped down as Fed chairman in early 2006 after nearly two decades, Greenspan was being hailed as the “maestro” for having skillfully managed the economy.  But by the next year, the first tremors from the subprime mortgage crisis were being felt. And by 2008, the economy was enduring a painful recession and its worst financial crisis in seven decades. Greenspan’s reputation as an astute economic manager suffered a severe blow.  Yellen can, if she chooses, stick around to help shape Fed policies after her term as chair ends on Feb. 3. Her separate term on the seven-member Fed board runs until Jan. 31, 2024. Marriner Eccles, the legendary Fed chairman whose name adorns the central bank’s headquarters building in Washington, is the only chairman to have remained on the board after serving as chairman.  Yellen could broaden her place in history if she became the second person to remain on the Fed’s board after stepping down as its leader. So far, she has been mum about her plans once her term as Fed chair ends.",3.7222222222222223,9,"[5.0, 3.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 0.5, 5.0, 1.5]"
1376,2979,11,3,2017,2017-11-03,Associated Press News,Why pay raises are elusive even with US unemployment so low,"Why pay raises are elusive even with US unemployment so low  In this Friday, Oct. 13, 2017, photo, a potential job candidate takes a flyer from a human resources representative at a Target store in Dallas. The U.S. government issues the October jobs report, Friday, Nov. 3, 2017. (AP Photo/LM Otero)  WASHINGTON (AP) — With U.S. unemployment at a 17-year low and businesses complaining that they can’t fill jobs, you might expect pay to be rising sharply as companies try to attract or keep workers.  It’s not. The October jobs report showed that pay gains remain sluggish, and the explanations include weak worker productivity and a still-low proportion of adults with jobs. These are long-running trends that still bedevil the economy despite its steady improvement.  Employers added a solid 261,000 jobs last month, the government said Friday, in part because many businesses in Texas and Florida re-opened after having been forced to shut down in September when Hurricanes Harvey and Irma struck.  The unemployment rate reached 4.1 percent, the lowest level in nearly 17 years, from 4.2 percent in September. But the rate dropped for a less-than-encouraging reason: Many people stopped looking for work and so were no longer counted as unemployed.  Still, Friday’s data showed that the hurricanes, for all their fury, hardly knocked the economy or the job market off course. Over the past three months, job growth has averaged 162,000— similar to the pace of hiring before the storms.  “Looking through the volatility from the hurricanes, the U.S. job market is in good shape,” said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial.  Normally, with the unemployment rate ultra-low, businesses are forced to raise pay significantly to fill jobs or to retain existing employees. The last time the jobless rate was this low, in 2000, average hourly pay was surging at a 4 percent annual pace.  Then was then. In October, by contrast, wages crept up just 2.4 percent from a year earlier, the government said Friday. Though that’s double the pace of five years ago, it’s nearly a half-point less than the year-over-year rate in September.  It’s particularly surprising given that some employers say they’re desperate to hire. Mike Bolen, chief executive of McCarthy Building Companies in St. Louis, said he needs more electricians, carpenters, and laborers, as well as engineers, marketing and IT support. McCarthy has 16 offices and employs 4,000.  “We like to say there is no unemployment,” Bolen said. “We have a shortage of everything, everywhere.”  Four years ago, there would be about 30 potential employees in a union hall waiting for job postings, he said. Now, the halls are empty, and there are posted jobs with no takers.  Bolen is working with high schools and community colleges to train and recruit young people. He says he’s raised pay in recent years and offers attractive wages: An entry-level laborer in Denver can start at $16 to $20 an hour and earn up to $30 after one year.  Homebuilders also say they would construct more homes — which could relieve a housing shortage that is depressing sales — if they could find more workers.  Still, the construction industry as a whole isn’t raising pay much: Wages rose just 2.2 percent in October from a year earlier, Friday’s report showed. That’s even lower than the economy-wide average.  Reed Nyffeler, CEO of Signal 88 Security, is similarly frustrated. He says job applications have fallen 90 percent since the recession. The company, which provides security in 200 U.S. markets, needs security officers and professional staff.  “We have franchisees telling me every day they are turning down contracts because they can’t find workers,” Nyffeler said.  Signal 88 has raised starting pay for security officers from $9.25 an hour to $11.25 in the past two years. But other low-wage employers have also lifted pay, Nyffeler said, thereby creating new competition for Signal.  Many potential applicants can’t pass drug tests, Nyffeler says, while others can live off government benefits.  His ability to raise pay, Nyffeler says, is limited because his clients are reluctant to pay more for his company’s services. Signal 88 bills at $17 an hour, on average. The company tries to raise prices each year when it renews contracts, but many of its clients then threaten to seek alternatives.  Other companies appear in similar circumstances: Price increases throughout the economy are weak. Inflation rose just 2.2 percent in September from a year ago and would have been lower without a spike in gas prices.  One way out of the conundrum would be to raise worker efficiency. When workers become more productive — when their output per hour rises — companies can afford to pay more without raising prices.  Yet productivity growth has been weak since the recession ended in 2009. It grew just 1.2 percent a year, on average, in the past decade. That’s less than half the growth rate before the recession. One reason productivity has been so sluggish is that companies haven’t invested much in machinery, technology and other equipment that could boost workers’ output.  The Trump administration and Republican Congress are pushing a steep cut in the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent in hopes of encouraging more productivity-boosting investment. But some economists argue that the increased profits stemming from the tax cut will be used mainly to boost dividends and share buybacks.  Jed Kolko, chief economist at Indeed, the job listing website, notes that the proportion of adults with jobs remains below pre-recession levels. That raises the possibility that there are more Americans available to work than the unemployment rate suggests. It also means that if employers can hire them, they may not feel pressure to raise pay.  Last month, 78.8 percent of adults aged 25 through 54 had jobs. That figure has risen 1.5 percentage points in the past two years. Yet it topped 81 percent in 2000, the last time unemployment was this low.  “By that measure, the labor market is not unusually tight,” Kolko said.",3.5,44,"[3.0, 4.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 1.5, 2.0, 4.0, 5.0, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 1.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0, 3.0, 4.5, 5.0, 0.5, 2.5, 5.0, 3.0, 4.5, 4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 2.5, 3.5, 2.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 2.0, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5]"

(AP Photo/Chuck Zoeller, File)  NEW YORK (AP) — More than 100 employees of The Associated Press petitioned the company’s management on Friday, asking if any sexual harassment complaints had been made against former news executive Michael Oreskes while he was employed there.  Oreskes, who worked at the AP from 2008 to 2015, was ousted this week as newsroom chief of National Public Radio following reports of improprieties when he worked at The New York Times in the 1990s and later at NPR. The AP has not said whether anyone has complained about Oreskes at the news agency. Jessica Bruce, senior vice president, said there have been “no written agreements, payments or settlements of any kind” made with anyone in connection with his behavior.  The request by 116 members of the News Media Guild came as the AP’s executive editor, Sally Buzbee, emailed a letter to staff members worldwide reminding them of steps they could take if they felt harassed or intimidated.  Meanwhile, NPR’s president and CEO, Jarl Mohn, held a meeting with the radio network’s employees on Friday to discuss the case. Mohn apologized, telling them he should have taken quicker action.  Oreskes was caught up in the flood of reports about bad behavior following revelations of alleged sexual assault by Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein. The veteran news executive resigned from NPR at Mohn’s request Wednesday following a Washington Post story about two women who said he suddenly kissed them while they were discussing job prospects in the 1990s. Oreskes was then Washington bureau chief at The New York Times. Since the initial Washington Post story about the accusations, two female NPR employees’ complaints have come to light about times when he had made them feel uncomfortable.  The NPR meeting was preceded by a note from Mohn to his staff stating that the company had hired an outside law firm to review its handling of complaints about Oreskes.  “I let you down,” Mohn said. “I should have acted faster and more decisively.”  Oreskes, in resigning, said he was deeply sorry to those whom he hurt and that his behavior was wrong and inexcusable.  While complaints about Oreskes’ behavior at The Times and NPR have been publicized, nothing has emerged about his tenure at the AP. The company said it refrains from commenting about personnel matters, and Bruce said this was particularly important considering Buzbee had just sent a letter to employees promising confidentiality if they made complaints.  Buzbee, who has circulated throughout the AP’s New York headquarters this week speaking informally to employees about the company’s policy on harassment, said it was important to send a letter to the AP’s worldwide staff to outline policies and remind them of the company’s confidential “integrity hotline.” The company takes seriously any complaints about conduct and investigates them, “past, present and future,” she said.  Her letter and the union’s petition essentially crossed in the mail Friday. The union asked Buzbee and AP management to publicize the hotline, encourage employees to come forward with information about harassers and provide training at all AP offices. The union also called on the AP to reveal whether any actions had been taken against Oreskes while he worked at the AP, and if any complaints had been lodged against him since he left.  One woman told the union about an incident with Oreskes that made her uncomfortable, but it wasn’t clear whether the person had lodged a formal complaint, said Martha Waggoner, president of the News Media Guild.  “We need assurance that the company has our backs, and if it received complaints, that the company did something about them,” she said.  Buzbee said she encourages staff members to spread her letter to past employees.  “I’m very happy that the guild has come forward about the issue, too,” she said.",2.9838709677419355,31,"[4.0, 2.5, 0.5, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 4.5, 3.0, 2.5, 2.5, 1.5, 5.0, 3.5, 2.5, 0.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.0, 1.5, 4.5, 5.0, 1.0, 3.5, 5.0, 1.0, 3.5, 3.5, 1.5, 3.0, 4.0, 3.5]"

Microsoft had previously given owners of PCs and laptops that ran on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 PC a whole year after the launch of Windows 10 to upgrade to the latest operating system without having to pay a single cent. This free upgrade closed down on July 31 of last year, leaving most users forced to pay the full price, with one notable exception. Any users who used what Microsoft defined as “assistive technology,” such as screen readers, had the chance to take the free upgrade, with an indefinite end date.  However, Microsoft has finally announced the end of this loophole, which is set to close on December 31 of this year. After that, anyone wanting to upgrade to Windows 10 will have to pay from around $75 or above for an upgrade license.  The definition of what counts as an “assistive technology” is rather broad, ensuring the maximum amount of people will still be able to upgrade for free. Microsoft explained its position in a support page:  We are not restricting the upgrade offer to specific assistive technologies… If you use assistive technology on Windows, you are eligible for the upgrade offer.  A cynical interpretation of this is that Microsoft is trying to ensure as many people upgrade to their latest operating system as possible. Arguably, anyone who has ever used the Windows Narrator tool has used an assistive technology. The more people that upgrade, the more it will benefit the company itself.

1392,3001,11,3,2017,2017-11-03,Breitbart,Christina Hoff Sommers to NYT: Modern Feminism Views Women as ‘Fragile and Easily Traumatized’,"In a brief interview with the New York Times this week, American Enterprise Institute Scholar Christina Hoff Sommers shared wide-ranging thoughts on modern feminism.  Christina Hoff Sommers was first asked to discuss the recent controversy surrounding Betsy DeVos’ decision to kill an Obama-era policy that allowed universities to discipline students who had been accused of sexual misconduct based only upon a preponderance of the evidence, the lowest possible legal standard.  “In the past few years, many of our campuses have descended into a kind of sexual McCarthyism where due process was suspended and the presumption of innocence was replaced by ‘guilty because accused,'” Sommers argued. “An untold number of college students have been subjected to injustices in these campus rape tribunals. The important thing is to establish due process. The standard of guilt is important, but not nearly as important as due process, where both sides are fully informed of the process and allowed to question the legitimacy of the evidence.”  Sommers was asked to explain her “equity feminism” theory.  “Equity feminism is just about gender equity. It wants for women what it wants for everyone — fair treatment, respect, and dignity,” she explained. “On today’s campus, equity feminism has been eclipsed by what I call “fainting couch feminism,” which views women as fragile and easily traumatized. It calls for special protections for women in sexual assault cases because it views women as an oppressed and silenced class.”  Others have marked an important distinction between Sommers’ brand of second-wave feminism and modern feminism. Second-wave feminists are more likely to believe that there are inherent biological differences between the sex that leads to different patterns of behavior, interests, and attitudes.  Sommers often refers to modern feminism as “victim feminism.”  “I think the rape culture theory was just an outgrowth of this infantilized view of women,” she explained. “The fainting couchers enlarged the meaning of sexual assault to include a lot of activities that most of us don’t think of as sexual assault. They collapsed the distinction between regretted sex and rape. An equity feminist does not assume that all sex under the influence is assault, or that men are automatically to blame. That’s not to say that sexual assault isn’t a real problem on campus.”",2.6666666666666665,3,"[2.5, 2.0, 3.5]"

Trump begins a five country trip through Asia traveling to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)  JOINT BASE PEARL HARBOR-HICKAM, Hawaii (AP) — President Donald Trump paid a solemn visit to the memorial at Pearl Harbor, a sacred journey for a commander-in-chief about to depart on an Asia trip that will be shadowed by fears of another international conflict.  Trump saluted Friday after entering the USS Arizona memorial following a short boat ride with first lady Melania Trump. They approached a wreath of white flowers — a gift from the couple — and watched as two sailors who stood beside it at attention placed the wreath near a wall of names of the fallen.  The Trumps then tossed white flower petals into the waters above the battleship’s sunken hull, as the president then peered down where the rusted wreckage is visible at the water’s surface.  Nearly 1,200 crew members died on the USS Arizona during the December 7, 1941 surprise attack by Japan that plunged the U.S. into World War II.  Trump, who had spoken earlier in the day about being eager to see the sacred site for the first time, appeared moved by the visit. As the wreath was quietly placed into position, Trump crossed his arms in front of him, closing his eyes as he bowed his head in remembrance.  President Trump is preparing for his first official trip to Asia with North Korea tensions at the fore. AP’s Asia-Pacific News Director previews his visit which includes stops in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. (Nov. 3)  As the sun began to fade over the Pacific, Trump then listened intently to a National Park Service tour guide, stopping briefly at a display that explained how some survivors of the attack, when they die years later, have chosen to be cremated and have their ashes placed in the sunken ship alongside the remains of their fallen colleagues.  Trump said not a word about North Korea or its nuclear ambitions on Friday, the eve of his first official visit to Asia. He will arrive in Japan on Sunday morning, the first of five countries he will visit over 11 days as he exhorts Asian allies to increase pressure on Pyongyang to abandon its deadly ambitions.  Hawaii acted as a sort of midway point on Trump’s trip halfway around the world. He arrived at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam Friday after a daylong flight from Washington.  The president quickly donned a lei after he left Air Force One with his wife, who also wore a wreath of flowers. He signed autographs and gave high-fives to kids who were among a group of civilians and service members that gathered for the arrival.  Trump wasn’t the only attraction to arrive on base. A few in the crowd shouted their admiration for White House chief of staff John Kelly.  “We love you Gen. Kelly,” one person shouted at the retired four-star Marine general who stood several feet behind the president.  Trump was briefed by leaders of the U.S. Pacific Command. The growing threat from North Korea — a crisis that will shadow the entire trip — was expected to be among the topics discussed. Trump was also meeting with the governors of Alaska, Hawaii and Pacific U.S. territories, all potential targets of any successful attempt by North Korea to strike the U.S. with a nuclear-tipped missile.  “We are going to visit very shortly, Pearl Harbor, which I’ve read about, spoken about, heard about, studied, but I haven’t seen. And that is going to be very exciting for me,” Trump said at the start of a briefing with leaders of the U.S. Pacific Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in the region.  The USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor marks the final resting place of more than 1,000 sailors and Marines who were killed on the battleship during the surprise attack on what President Franklin Roosevelt deemed “a date which we live in infamy.” Accessible only by boat, the memorial straddles the ship’s sunken hull.  A total of more than 2,300 sailors, soldiers and Marines died as a result of the attack, as well as 68 civilians, according to the National Park Service.  The visit to the memorial comes soon after Trump was embroiled in a controversy over his attempt to console the grieving families of America’s war dead.

The plan approved Thursday at a meeting of the governing boards of the twin ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach outlines strategies for improving equipment and efficiency to eventually move cargo with zero emissions.  The ports estimate that the cost of the efforts ranges from $7 billion to $14 billion, but the plan does not make clear who will pick up the tab. And detailed plans for implementing each program will require approval by each port’s harbor commission.  “Collaboration will be critical to our success,” Long Beach Harbor Commission President Lou Anne Bynum said in a statement. “Moving the needle to zero requires all of us — the ports, industry, regulatory agencies, environmental groups and our communities — to pool our energy, expertise and resources.”  The plan has raised concerns that the enormous cost of the clean air goals could make the two ports less attractive in the face of competition from ports on the East and Gulf coasts.  The Los Angeles Times reported that Pacific Merchant Shipping Association President John McLaurin told commissioners he fears the cost “and its potential negative impacts on port competitiveness and the one in nine jobs in the Southern California region that are reliant on the ports.”  The neighboring ports 20 miles south of downtown Los Angeles are the single largest fixed source of air pollution in Southern California, according to the South Coast Air Quality Management District.  Main points of the plan include clean-engine milestones for trucks, creating incentives to speed up fleet turnover to near-zero and zero-emission trucks, and efficiency programs for truck reservations and staging yards. The timeline for achieving a zero-emission truck fleet is 2035.  Other elements include requiring terminal operators to use zero-emission equipment by 2020, if possible, or the cleanest available equipment.  The plan also pursues electrification of terminal equipment and expands on-dock rail, with a goal of moving 50 percent of all cargo out of the ports by train.  The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach sprawl over more than 23 square miles (60 square kilometers) of land and water. They handle about 40 percent of U.S. container import traffic, about 25 percent of total exports, and together rank as the ninth-largest port complex in the world, according to the ports.",4.166666666666667,3,"[4.0, 4.0, 4.5]"

Earnings growth, at least before adjusting for inflation, has accelerated a bit in recent years. And more sophisticated measures show somewhat stronger gains. The Employment Cost Index, a measure of compensation that considers benefits as well as cash pay, was up 2.5 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, its fastest pace in two and a half years.  Some industries are seeing faster growth — and not just for high-earners. In recent months, there have been hints that wage gains are filtering down to workers in fast food and other low-wage industries. In September, the retail giant Target announced that it was raising pay for all its workers to at least $11 an hour and would pay at least $15 an hour by the end of 2020. That move, and others like it, is putting pressure on other low-wage employers to increase pay.  “It’s really hard to retain employees when those companies are saying, ‘Any employee in our company is getting at least $15 an hour,’” said Jennifer Durham, chief development officer for Checkers and Rally’s, a drive-through burger chain with 860 locations across the country.  So far, however, Checkers and Rally’s has resisted broad-based pay increases, choosing instead to focus on helping employees earn more through advancement.  “Base pay is a starting point, but it’s not the entire proposition,” Ms. Durham said.  Republicans in Washington in recent weeks have proposed their own solution to slow wage growth: lower taxes on businesses, which they argue would lead to big pay increases for workers. Many economists are skeptical that companies would pass tax savings on to workers, or argue that the benefits of the Republicans’ proposed tax plan would be far smaller than its authors claim.  Instead, economists point to another factor holding back wage gains: productivity. Growth in productivity — how much workers can produce in an hour, on average — has been slow, making it harder for companies to improve wages without eating into profit margins.  “It’s hard to get wages really taking off without productivity growth,” Mr. Ryan said.  Productivity growth accelerated in the third quarter, though it is too soon to know whether the that represents the start of a longer-lasting rebound. And despite the disappointing pay data, there are signs that companies are being forced to work harder to attract employees, and to keep the ones they have from bolting to competitors. A report from the payroll-processing firm ADP this month found that people who switch jobs are seeing significant pay gains, which suggests workers are jumping ship in search of better opportunities.",3.65,20,"[3.0, 5.0, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 2.5, 5.0, 3.0, 4.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 0.5, 1.0, 3.5, 4.0, 3.0, 2.5, 4.5, 4.5]"

Since 1900, the reports said Earth has warmed by 1.8 degrees (1 degree Celsius) and seas have risen by 8 inches. (AP Photo/Tom Copeland)  WASHINGTON (AP) — A massive U.S. report concludes the evidence of global warming is stronger than ever, contradicting a favorite talking point of top Trump administration officials, who downplay humans’ role in climate change.  The report released Friday is one of two scientific assessments required every four years. A draft showing how warming affects the U.S. was also published.  Despite fears by some scientists and environmental advocates, David Fahey of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and several authors said there was no political interference or censoring of the 477-page final report.  “A lot of what we’ve been learning over the last four years suggests the possibility that things may have been more serious than we think,” said Robert Kopp of Rutgers University, one of dozens of scientists inside and outside the government who wrote the reports.  Since 1900, Earth has warmed by 1.8 degrees (1 degree Celsius) and seas have risen by 8 inches. Heat waves, downpours and wildfires have become frequent.  Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt have repeatedly said carbon dioxide isn’t the primary contributor to global warming.  It’s “extremely likely” — meaning with 95 to 100 percent certainty — that global warming is man-made, mostly from the spewing of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, scientists concluded.  “Over the last century, there are no convincing alternative explanations,” the report said.  Scientists calculated that human contribution to warming since 1950 is between 92 percent and 123 percent. It’s more than 100 percent on one end, because some natural forces — such as volcanoes and orbital cycle — are working to cool Earth, but are being overwhelmed by the effects of greenhouse gases, said study co-author Katharine Hayhoe of Texas Tech.  “This period is now the warmest in the history of modern civilization,” she said.  For the first time, scientists highlighted a dozen “tipping points” of potential dangers that could happen from warming, things that Hayhoe said “keep me up at night.”  They include the slowing down of the giant Atlantic Ocean circulation system that could dramatically warp weather worldwide, much stronger El Ninos, major decreases in ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, which would spike sea level rise, and massive release of methane and carbon dioxide from thawing permafrost that could turbo-charge warming.  Researchers did not provide an estimate of how likely tipping points would occur, but “there is certainly some chance of some of these things happening,” Fahey said.  The report also documented how different climate change-caused events can interact in a complex way to make life worse such as the California wildfires and Superstorm Sandy five years ago.  The world’s oceans are under a “triple threat” — the water is getting warmer, more acidic and seeing a drop in oxygen levels, Hayhoe said.  In a 1,504-page draft report on the impacts of climate change, scientists detailed dozens of ways global warming is already affecting parts of the U.S.  Scientists said global warming is already sickening, injuring and killing Americans with changes to weather, food, air, water and diseases. And it’s expected to get worse, hurting the economy, wildlife and energy supply.  “Risks range from the inconvenient, such as increasing high tide flooding along the East Coast related to sea level rise, to ... the forced relocation of coastal communities in Alaska and along the Gulf Coast,” the draft report said.  Outside experts said the reports are the most up-to-date summary of climate science.  “It shows that if anything the findings of scientists have become more dire” since 2013, said University of California, Berkeley climate scientist Zeke Hausfather, who wasn’t part of the work.  ___  Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears .

The UN Climate Change Conference 2017 will take place under Presidency of the Government of Fiji in Bonn, Germany and starts on Monday, Nov. 6, 2017. (AP Photo/Martin Meissner, file)  BERLIN (AP) — Governments, scientists, industry groups and environmental campaigners are meeting in Germany next week to discuss implementing a global agreement to curb climate change, despite uncertainty over how the United States will figure into the effort.  President Donald Trump announced earlier this year that the U.S. will pull out of the 2015 Paris climate accord unless his administration can secure a better deal.  Other countries have pledged to press on regardless at the Nov. 6-17 meeting in the western German city of Bonn. The 23rd Conference of the Parties (COP) will be presided over by Fiji, one of the small island nations particularly vulnerable to the effects of global warming.  Researchers say extreme weather like the events of recent months — including hurricanes in the Caribbean, heatwaves in Europe and flooding in south Asia — are going to become more frequent as a result of climate change. To prevent catastrophic consequences, they say countries must make concerted efforts to shift the global economy away from fossil fuels and to adjust to some inevitable impacts, such as rising sea levels.  “This COP is more important than most people realize,” Andrew Steer, head of the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based environmental think tank, said.  Steer said a growing number of commitments from governments, as well as from major companies and cities around the world was “broadly encouraging.” He noted the falling cost of renewable energy — a key technology required to help power-hungry economies kick the carbon habit.  Most of the 195 countries coming to Bonn — where the U.N. climate agency is located — appear willing to continue hammering out the details needed to make the Paris 2015 accord work, German Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks said ahead of the two-week talks.  Negotiators will try to agree on ways to measure each country’s greenhouse gas emissions and to make sure everyone is playing by the same rules. Since the Paris agreement doesn’t foresee sanctions for countries that fail to meet their targets, peer pressure is the main mechanism for ensuring that governments abide by their commitments and continue to increase their efforts in future.  A key issue will be the transparency of emissions reports, said Nigel Purvis, a former U.S. State Department negotiator under the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush presidencies.  The United States used to be the major force pushing for more open reporting and that will suffer because of the Trump administration’s planned withdrawal from Paris, he said.  “Without U.S. leadership the deal is likely to take a little bit longer and may not be as strong,” said Purvis, president of the group Climate Advisers.  Negotiators have until the end of 2018 to come up with the final rule book; it would be subject to approval at the next climate summit in Katowice, Poland.  Observers say that without the United States driving the talks — as it did in Paris when Barack Obama was in the White House — other leaders will have to fill the gap.  “The United States are not anymore the most important actor in this game of climate change,” Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said.  “The most important actor is China, and India will soon become extremely important, as well as the European Union,” Schellnhuber said.  Some are also placing their hopes in Emmanuel Macron. The French president is expected to fly in on Nov. 15 to show his support during the final phase of the talks. Macron has called for a follow-up meeting in Paris next month.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel, a veteran of past climate summits, will also put in an appearance in Bonn despite being tied up in negotiations to form a new government. The Green Party, with which she hopes to forge a coalition, has urged Merkel to set a firm date for Germany to end the use of coal-fired power plants.

1268,2867,11,2,2017,2017-11-02,Fox News,Judge Andrew Napolitano: Mueller's ultimate target is Trump. Here's what could happen next,"Earlier this week, the government revealed that a grand jury sitting in Washington, D.C., indicted a former Trump presidential campaign chairman and his former deputy and business partner for numerous felonies.  Both were accused of working as foreign agents and failing to report that status to the federal government, using shell corporations to launder income and obstruction of justice by lying to the federal government.  The financial crimes are alleged to have occurred from 2008 to 2014, and the obstruction charges from 2014 to 2017. At the same time it announced the above, the government revealed that a low-level former foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, George Papadopoulos, had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and become a government witness.  Does any of this relate to President Donald Trump? Here is the back story.  At the same time that Paul Manafort and his business partner Rick Gates were guiding the Trump campaign in the summer of 2016, Russian agents were manipulating American social media sites so as to arouse chaos in general and animosity toward Hillary Clinton in particular. The Department of Justice appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as independent counsel to determine whether any Americans had criminally helped the Russians.  The alleged crimes of Manafort and Gates appear to have nothing to do with Trump, nor have they any facial relationship to the Russians. So why were these two indicted by a grand jury hearing evidence about alleged American assistance to Russian interference with the 2016 presidential campaign?  When prosecutors confront a complex series of potentially criminal events, they often do not know at the outset of their investigation where the evidence will lead them. Sometimes they come upon a person who they believe has knowledge of facts they seek and that person declines to speak with them. Such a refusal to speak to the government is perfectly lawful in America, yet it often triggers a prosecution of the potential witness so that prosecutors may squeeze him -- not literally, of course -- for evidence to which they believe he can lead them.  The ultimate target of Mueller’s investigation is President Trump. It is standard operating procedure when prosecutors have a high-level target to charge those below the target with something just to get them to cooperate. Though the charges against Manafort and Gates need not be related to the Russians or to Trump, they must be real. It's clear they are, as each is facing more than 20 years in prison. Mueller believes that that prospect is enough to dispatch their lawyers to make deals with him.  The danger of such a deal is that Manafort and Gates may offer to tell Mueller what they think he wants to hear -- even if it is not truthful -- so that they can have their prison exposure lessened.  There is more danger in the seemingly smallest of this week’s Mueller-generated events. Papadopoulos was interviewed voluntarily by the FBI on Jan. 27. He was arrested on July 27 for lying to FBI agents during that interview. In a secret federal court proceeding on Oct. 5, he pleaded guilty.  In a profound miscarriage of justice, federal law permits FBI agents to lie to us but makes it a crime for us to lie to them. Nevertheless, why was the Papadopoulos guilty plea kept secret? What was he doing between his arrest and his plea and between his plea and its revelation?  Judges are very reluctant to close their courtroom doors in any criminal proceeding, even if both the prosecutors and the defense counsel request it. The public has a right to know whom the government is prosecuting and what deals or punishments it may be obtaining. Yet if prosecutors can convince a judge that public knowledge of the existence of a guilty plea might harm an ongoing criminal investigation, the judge can keep the plea secret.  That is apparently what happened here. It appears that Papadopoulos was gathering evidence for Mueller, probably by talking to his former Trump campaign colleagues while wired -- a process that would have been fruitless if his guilty plea had become public.  Because Papadopoulos admitted under oath that he lied to FBI agents, the courts will treat his guilt as certain. That gives Mueller great leverage with him. It also gives Papadopoulos great incentive to help Mueller -- truthfully or not -- because he knows he is going to federal prison. He also knows that if Mueller likes what he hears, a five-year prison term could be reduced to six months.  Hence, Papadopoulos could be a treasure-trove for Mueller on the production of any evidence linking the Trump campaign and the Russians and any evidence of Trump’s personal knowledge or acquiescence. Papadopoulos has already produced a wild tale about meetings with a Russian professor and a female Russian government agent in London that the FBI apparently believes.  Is this any way to conduct a prosecution?  I have argued for years that squeezing defendants and witnesses by threats and promises to get them to spill the beans is a form of extortion or bribery -- not much different from the extortion and bribery that the government regularly prosecutes. ""You tell us what we want to hear and we will ask a judge to go easy on you. If not, you will suffer great losses."" It is bad enough that the feds can legally lie to us and get away with it, but can they also legally threaten and bribe witnesses to testify against us and get away with it? Can they do this to the president?  In a word, yes. My arguments have fallen on deaf ears. Squeezing witnesses and defendants is a way of life for federal prosecutors. For the president, it is the tip of a dangerous iceberg.",3.25,6,"[0.5, 4.5, 2.5, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5]"

Built during the reign of Pharaoh Khufu, the monument was a testament to the ruler’s architectural prowess and is thought to have been a home for his mummified remains.  For centuries, archaeologists have ventured into the Pyramid of Khufu, as it is also known, and marveled at the King’s chamber, the Queen’s chamber and the Grand Gallery. Now, using a technique from the field of particle physics, an international team of researchers has harnessed cosmic-ray collisions to peek inside and uncover a hidden “void” within the pyramid’s stones that is roughly 100 feet long, similar to the Statue of Liberty from her heel to her head.  “We don’t know if it’s a chamber, a tunnel, a big gallery or things like that,” said Mehdi Tayoubi, co-director of the ScanPyramids project, which published the finding Thursday in the journal Nature. “We have chosen the word ‘void’ and nothing else because we don’t know what this void is.”  Many archaeologists questioned whether the study offered any new information about the ancient Egyptians, and were quick to note that the team had most likely not found a hidden room filled with the pharaoh’s riches. They said the so-called void was probably empty space designed by the pyramid’s architects to lessen the weight on its chambers and prevent them from collapsing, an example of features that were already documented in the construction of the ancient monuments.",5.0,1,[5.0]

Ron DeSantis (R-FL) spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Thursday regarding a proposed Mueller amendment to limit the special counsel investigation to between March 2015 and the present. The two also discussed tax reform in the House.  DeSantis said, “There are really no limitations to what the special counsel can do in either time or scope, and I thought that that was very dangerous. So my amendment would have limited the time–put up, or shut up if you don’t have anything on this Russia stuff. And then, it would have limited it to the campaign.”  “You can’t go back five or six years just trying to find anything on somebody,” he continued, pointing out that Comey was investigating for a year prior to Mueller, and there is zero evidence of any collusion, which was supposed to be the focus of the entire investigation in the first place.  “I think that from the day after the election,” said DeSantis, “I think the Dems and their allies in the media are like, ‘We’ve got to kneecap this guy no matter what we can do. We just have to do whatever we can.’ I think they settled on this Russian narrative. The media is so invested in it, even a little speck of dirt gets blown up.”  He added, “In this case, because the special counsel never identified a crime to investigate, he basically can just go and find anybody involved in this campaign: ‘Can we find anything on this person or that person?’ That is not the way the government is supposed to operate.

The discovery, which was revealed in the journal Nature, has been described as the first discovery of a major new space within the pyramid since the 19th century.  An international team of researchers used cosmic-ray imaging to find a 30-meter (98.4 foot) “void” within the Great Pyramid, which is also known as Khufu's Pyramid for its builder, a 4th Dynasty pharaoh who reigned from 2509 to 2483 B.C.  TOMB OF KING TUT’S WIFE DISCOVERED? EXPERTS EXCITED BY FIND IN EGYPT  Cosmic ray imaging records the behavior of subatomic particles called muons that penetrate the rock similar to X-rays, only much deeper.  The muon scan harnesses special plates that are planted inside and around the pyramid to collect data on the particles, which rain down from the earth's atmosphere. The particles pass through empty spaces but can be absorbed or deflected by harder surfaces, enabling scientists to study their trajectories and discern what is stone and what is not. Several plates were used to triangulate the void discovered in the Great Pyramid.  The technology was also used to analyze the Fukushima nuclear reactor after it was damaged by an earthquake and tsunami in 2011.  DESERT DISCOVERY: LOST TEMPLE OF RAMSES II UNCOVERED BY ARCHAEOLOGISTS  Scientists involved in the pyramid scanning called the find a ""breakthrough"" that highlighted the usefulness of modern particle physics in archaeology.  ""This is a premier,"" said Mehdi Tayoubi, a co-founder of the ScanPyramids project and president of the Heritage Innovation Preservation Institute. ""It could be composed of one or several structures... maybe it could be another Grand Gallery. It could be a chamber, it could be a lot of things.""  ""It was hidden, I think, since the construction of the pyramid,"" he added.  ARCHAEOLOGISTS DISCOVER TOMBS FROM ANCIENT 'GREAT CEMETERY' IN EGYPT'S NILE VALLEY  Intriguingly, the newly discovered space does not appear to be connected to any known internal passages. Egyptologists, however, say there is unlikely to be any treasure within the hidden space.  The pyramid’s ‘void’ is the latest ancient Egyptian discovery to thrill experts. Last month, for example, archaeologists announced the discovery of an ancient temple belonging to King Ramses II. In August experts revealed that they had unearthed three tombs from an ancient “great cemetery” in Egypt’s Nile Valley. A month earlier, archaeologists said that a tomb that may have belonged to the wife of King Tutankhamun had been discovered in Egypt’s Valley of the Kings.

The Wall Street Journal claims the officials have been “identified” as being “involved” in the release of internal DNC emails showing systematic favoritism for candidate Hillary Clinton over rival Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). Separately from the leak, that narrative was given independent verification Wednesday in an upcoming book by interim-DNC Chairwoman Donna Brazile. She posits the DNC, in effect, turned over its operations to the Clinton campaign.  It is not clear from the reporting if the investigation referred to in the Wall Street Journal falls under Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office, but the story notes, “It is unclear if prosecutors will hold back filing charges until Mr. Mueller completes his investigation or wait to identify others who may have played a role in the DNC hack. Investigators believe dozens of others may have played a role in the cyberattack, the people said.”  The Special Counsel’s Office has seen a flurry of activity this week, revealing a serious 12-count indictment against one-time Donald Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort and his deputy, Richard Gates – unrelated to the 2016 campaign – and going public with the previously sealed guilty plea of a low-level campaign staffer for making false statements to the FBI.  The Wall Street Journal also claims, “U.S. intelligence agencies have attributed the attack to Russian intelligence services, but haven’t provided detailed information about how they concluded those services were responsible, or any details about the individuals allegedly involved.”  Omitted is the infamous – and now discredited – “17 intelligence agencies” claim.  Also missing was any mention of the July report of the Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS) group that claimed the leak could not possibly have been the result of a Russian hack. The validity of that study was called into question immediately upon its August publication by The Nation, and its accuracy would directly conflict with Wednesday’s Wall Street Journal report.

Read the full statement below:  Dear Colleagues,  During the past year, I have been the object of a great deal of scrutiny from the press. I have declined to comment on what has been written about me, imagining that with time the attention would dissipate. Because that has yet to happen, I have decided to correct some of the misinformation that has been published about me. It is not my intention to impose the views I describe below on anyone else.  My goal is simply to explain my thinking, the very essence of which is that all of us should think for ourselves.  I believe that individuals are happiest and most fulfilled when they form their own opinions, assume responsibility for their own actions, and spend the fruits of their own labor as they see fit. I believe that a collection of individuals making their own decisions within the confines of a clear and concise set of laws that they have determined for themselves will advance society much more effectively than will a collection of experts who are confident in their knowledge of what is best for everyone else. This is why I support conservatives, who favor a smaller, less powerful government.  A society founded on the basis of the individual freedom that flourishes under a limited federal government has no place for discrimination. Of the many mischaracterizations made of me by the press, the most repugnant to me have been the intimations that I am a white supremacist or a member of some other noxious group.  Discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, creed, or anything of that sort is abhorrent to me. But more than that, it is ignorant.  The press has also intimated that my politics marches in lockstep with Steve Bannon’s. I have great respect for Mr. Bannon, and from time to time I do discuss politics with him. However, I make my own decisions with respect to whom I support politically. Those decisions do not always align with Mr. Bannon’s.  Without individuals thinking for themselves, society as a whole will struggle to distinguish the signal of truth from the correlated noise of conformity. I supported Milo Yiannopoulos in the hope and expectation that his expression of views contrary to the social mainstream and his spotlighting of the hypocrisy of those who would close down free speech in the name of political correctness would promote the type of open debate and freedom of thought that is being throttled on many American college campuses today. But in my opinion, actions of and statements by Mr. Yiannopoulos have caused pain and divisiveness undermining the open and productive discourse that I had hoped to facilitate. I was mistaken to have supported him, and for several weeks have been in the process of severing all ties with him.  For personal reasons, I have also decided to sell my stake in Breitbart News to my daughters.  I would also like to inform you of a decision I have reached with respect to my role at Renaissance, an organization I adore with colleagues whom I deeply respect and admire. I am 71 years old, the same age that Jim Simons was when he retired. I do not plan to retire, but I do plan to relinquish my management responsibilities.  Peter Brown and I have been Co-CEOs for the past eight years. On January 1, 2018, I will step down from my position as Co-CEO and resign from the board of directors. I will continue with the firm as a member of its technical staff, focusing on the research work that I find most fulfilling. Peter will continue on as CEO, and I will provide him with my counsel whenever he feels that I can be helpful to him and to the company where I have spent so many wonderful years.

1320,2919,11,2,2017,2017-11-02,Vox,Meet the newest species of great ape. They’re already endangered.,"In 2013, a male orangutan named Raya died in the care of veterinarians after a cruel confrontation with local villagers on the Indonesian island of Sumatra.  Up until that point, biologists believed there were just two species of orangutan, one that lives on the island of Borneo and one on Sumatra. And they knew that their populations, as with the other non-human great apes on Earth — gorillas, chimpanzees, and bonobos — are dwindling. Only 60,000 orangutans in total are believed to be left.  Raya, though, belonged to a special group of around 800 individuals in the Batang Toru forest of Sumatra. And biologists suspected that group might be slightly different from the orangutans on the rest of the island. The orangutans of Raya’s group have frizzier fur and eat different foods.  An analysis of Raya’s skull, coupled with a genetic analysis of some of his relatives, revealed Raya was not like the main species of orangutan on the island. Thursday in the journal Current Biology, a team of geneticists and biologists has announced there’s a third species of orangutan in the world, Pongo tapanuliensis, or the Tapanuli orangutan. It’s the first new great ape species to be proposed in the scientific literature in 90 years, since the bonobos were discovered in 1927.  But there’s not much time to celebrate: This species only has around 800 members, making it critically endangered, the highest extinction risk category described by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).  “A combination of small population size and geographic isolation is of particularly high conservation concern,” the authors of the paper write, “as it may lead to inbreeding ... and threaten population persistence.”  These apes are in trouble.  ""We were quite surprised that [Raya’s] skull was quite different in some characteristics from anything we had seen before,"" Matt Nowak, one of the authors of the study, said in a press statement.  Raya and his Tapanuli brethren have smaller skulls than the main species of orangutan on Sumatra, the Pongo abelii. And overall, they look more similar to the species of orangutan found across the sea on Borneo.  And DNA analysis revealed they are, in fact, more genetically similar to their Bornean cousins than to the Sumatrans.  How can that be? Borneo is hundreds of miles across the sea from Sumatra.  At the Atlantic, Ed Yong explains that millions of years ago, Borneo and Sumatra were linked in continuous landmass. First, the population that Raya belonged to split off from the main branch of the species. Then another group spread throughout this continuous landmass, becoming the Bornean and main Sumatran orangutan we know today.  Not all scientists are buying that these orangutan are indeed their own species. The analysis was limited to the one skull and the genetics of just a few individuals. And often nature doesn’t provide a clear cutoff between one species and another (as often different lineages on the tree of life continue to mate with one another occasionally after they’ve split apart). Questions about speciation are magnets for debate.  But we know enough to know the Tapanuli orangutan, with its gorgeous long orange fur, is special. And it’s in trouble.",3.6052631578947367,19,"[4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.5, 2.5, 1.5, 3.0, 4.5, 4.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0, 2.5, 4.5, 3.5]"
1312,2911,11,2,2017,2017-11-02,Vox,Rick Perry actually tried to argue that fossil fuels can help fight sexual assault,"Rick Perry, y’all.  The energy secretary on Thursday actually said this during a discussion about energy policy and Africa: “But also from the standpoint of sexual assault. When the lights are on, when you have light that shines the righteousness, if you will, on those types of acts. So from the standpoint of how you really affect people’s lives, fossil fuels is going to play a role in that. I happen to think it’s going to play a positive role.”  The implication is that fossil fuels power lights, and those lights can then help prevent or at least expose sexual assault. This manages to be both offensive and wrong.  For one, this claim attempts to use a serious topic — sexual assault — to score some political points for one of Perry’s long-held beliefs about the fossil fuel industry. It just feels gross, as Emily Atkin of the New Republic pointed out on Twitter. How about if instead of talking about the wonders of fossil fuels, we talk about how men just need to stop treating other people like objects?  Obviously Perry's use of sexual assault victims to promote Trump's fossil fuel agenda is offensive. Let's just get that out of the way. — Emily Atkin (@emorwee) November 2, 2017  Looking at the substance, the implication that you need fossil fuels to turn on lights is also false. There are also alternative energy sources — nuclear, solar, power, hydro, and so on — that work. As Atkin pointed out in her Twitter thread, there are even “huge untapped resources for renewable energy” in Africa.  In Africa specifically—where Perry was talking about—there is “huge untapped resources for renewable energy” https://t.co/B4L0WBt8B0 — Emily Atkin (@emorwee) November 2, 2017  Even the underlying assumption of Perry’s comments is questionable. As Christopher Ingraham pointed out over at the Washington Post, the evidence on whether lighting stops and deters crime is mixed. Here are some of the studies:  A 2007 systematic review of the research, covering 13 studies, found that US studies had mixed results, although UK studies reported much more positive outcomes.  A 2015 study in England and Wales concluded, “There is no evidence that reduced street lighting is associated with increases in road traffic collisions or crime.”  A 1997 report to Congress found, “Lighting has received considerable attention. Yet, evaluation designs are weak and the results are mixed. We can have very little confidence that improved lighting prevents crime, particularly since we do not know if offenders use lighting to their advantage.”  This is such a contentious topic in the empirical research that CityLab’s 2014 article on it, by Mike Riggs, was titled “Street Lights and Crime: A Seemingly Endless Debate.”  When it comes to Perry, though, it means that his statements range from ridiculous and wrong to questionable.",2.3214285714285716,14,"[0.5, 0.5, 3.0, 3.0, 5.0, 4.0, 2.5, 5.0, 2.5, 3.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.5, 0.5]"
1272,2871,11,2,2017,2017-11-02,Vox,Here’s what Trump’s opioid commission wants him to do,"If President Donald Trump is serious about dealing with the opioid epidemic, we now have an official checklist by which to judge his administration’s actions.  On Wednesday, Trump’s opioid commission, led by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, put out its long-awaited recommendations to deal with the nation’s drug overdose crisis — just days after Trump declared a public health emergency over the epidemic, which contributed to the US’s record 64,000 drug overdose deaths in 2016.  The list includes more than 50 recommendations, touching on a variety of federal, state, and local agencies. They include streamlining federal money for drug addiction, knocking down barriers to treatment, expanding federal drug courts, and implementing new training requirements for doctors who prescribe opioid painkillers.  The commission does not say how much funding implementing its recommendations or tackling the opioid crisis will require — leaving a huge question open, even as it argues that “Congress must act” and “appropriate sufficient funds to implement the Commission’s recommendations.” It also does not call for a new, large investment into drug addiction treatment, as some advocates hoped for.  With its final report, the commission ends months of work in which it met with major stakeholders involved in the crisis, from people struggling with addiction to insurers to pharmaceutical companies.  The question now is whether Trump and Congress will listen to the recommendations.  What Trump’s commission recommends  Here are some of the biggest recommendations in the report:  Streamline federal funding for drug addiction: According to the report, nearly every governor’s office complained about the “fragmented” state of federal funding for opioids and addiction. The report recommends streamlining the current process into a block grant, which should require “one application and one set of reporting requirements” for funding. The commission argues this would let states focus less on paperwork and more on actually implementing policies.

The commission argues this would let states focus less on paperwork and more on actually implementing policies. Remove barriers to treatment: The report proposes a number of moves for federal agencies to remove barriers to addiction treatment, including better enforcement of parity laws that in theory require insurers to pay for such care. But it stops short of calling for a new, large federal investment into treatment. This is needed: According to a 2016 report by the surgeon general, only 10 percent of Americans with drug use disorders get specialty treatment — in large part because they often can’t afford such services and, even if they can, can face waiting periods of weeks or even months to get in.

Open drug courts in all federal jurisdictions: Drug courts, which divert people from prison to addiction treatment, were up and running in less than 30 percent of federal districts in 2015, according to the report. The commission said this should be 100 percent. The argument for this is harm reduction: Drug courts can make sure that people who need treatment get that instead of prison time. But drug courts have been criticized for frequently ignoring evidence-based treatment options, including anti-addiction medications like methadone and buprenorphine, which are considered the gold standard for treating opioid addiction.

Stop evaluating doctors based on pain scores: One of the reasons for the rise in the prescription of opioids is doctors were commonly evaluated in government-mandated surveys based on how well they treated a patient’s self-reported pain. This encouraged doctors to prescribe opioids that could lead to short-term improvements in pain but, in the long term, lead to addiction, overdose, and other problems. To end this perverse incentive, the commission asks that patient satisfaction surveys used to evaluate doctors no longer include any questions about pain.

To end this perverse incentive, the commission asks that patient satisfaction surveys used to evaluate doctors no longer include any questions about pain. Allow more emergency responders to deploy naloxone: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration currently puts out a best-practices guide that suggests certain emergency responders carry naloxone, an opioid overdose antidote. The commission wants that guide to include all emergency medical staff, which some states currently don’t allow. But the report’s recommendation doesn’t extend to opening access to naloxone beyond that — which some advocates would like to see.

Tougher prison sentences for fentanyl : The commission calls for “the enhancement of federal sentencing penalties for the trafficking of fentanyl [a potent synthetic opioid] and fentanyl analogues.” The empirical evidence shows this will have little to no effect on drug use, but it’s a very popular idea within the law enforcement community.

A media campaign: The report recommends a federally funded media campaign on addiction stigma and the dangers of opioids. This is one of Trump’s favorite ideas, which he has repeatedly invoked. The research, however, shows these campaigns often fail — or, worse, actually lead to more drug use by making drugs an attractive sign of rebellion or triggering curiosity about drugs that kids or teens previously didn’t know existed.  This is only a summary of some of the key recommendations, giving an idea of the many issues the commission tried to address. And they come on top of the commission’s previous recommendations. For all 56 proposals, read the full report.  So far, the reaction to the commission’s report by activists and experts is mixed. Baltimore City Health Commissioner Leana Wen, a major advocate on the opioid crisis, summed up much of the sentiment in a statement: “While the final report issued today by the President’s Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis addresses critical aspects of the fight against the nation’s opioid epidemic, it does not go nearly far enough.”  It’s on Trump and Congress now  The question now is whether Trump and Congress will actually follow through on the recommendations. Trump, after all, took months to act on one of the proposals in the commission’s preliminary report issued in July — and he left many of the other early recommendations, at least so far, untouched.  Politically, this is a very important issue for Trump. A post-election analysis by historian Kathleen Frydl found, for example, that most of the Ohio and Pennsylvania counties that flipped from former President Barack Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016 had very high drug overdose death rates.  The opioid epidemic goes back to the 1990s, with the release of OxyContin and mass marketing of prescription painkillers, as well as campaigns like “Pain as the Fifth Vital Sign” that pushed doctors to treat pain as a serious medical problem. This contributed to the spread of opioid painkiller misuse and addiction, which over time also led to greater use of illicitly produced opioids like heroin and fentanyl. Drug overdose deaths have climbed every year since the late ’90s as a result.  The issue has really turned into two simultaneous crises — which Keith Humphreys, a Stanford University drug policy expert, has described as the dual problems of “stock” and “flow.” On one hand, you have the current stock of opioid users who are addicted; the people in this population need treatment or they will simply find other, potentially deadlier opioids to use if they lose access to prescribed painkillers. On the other hand, you have to stop new generations of potential drug users from accessing and misusing opioids.  Addressing these crises will, experts say, require tens of billions of federal dollars. As I previously explained, we have a pretty good idea of what those resources should go to: They could be used to boost access to treatment, pull back lax access to opioid painkillers while keeping them accessible to patients who truly need them, and adopt harm reduction policies that mitigate the damage caused by opioids and other drugs.  Some states are attempting to confront this issue. Vermont, for example, has built a “hub and spoke” system that treats addiction as a public health issue and integrates treatment into the health care system. Potentially as a result, the state was the only one in New England to have a drug overdose death rate below the national average in 2015. (For more, check out our in-depth breakdown of Vermont’s system.)  But Vermont managed to build this new system in large part with federal dollars, particularly through Obamacare’s insurance expansion and a special Medicaid waiver that states can obtain through the health care law. It’s that kind of federal support that budget-strained states will need to deal with the opioid crisis — yet it’s unclear, even after this report, what Trump and Congress will do to make that federal support available to more states.",4.444444444444445,9,"[5.0, 3.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.0, 5.0]"
1310,2909,11,2,2017,2017-11-02,Fox News,US workers' productivity jumps 3 percent in third quarter,"U.S. workers' productivity jumped 3 percent in the third quarter, the strongest gain in three years, while labor costs remained moderate.  The increase in productivity in the July-September quarter was double the 1.5 percent gain in the second quarter, the Labor Department reported Thursday. Unit labor costs rose a modest 0.5 percent in the third quarter, up only slightly from a 0.3 percent gain in the second quarter.  The strong upturn in productivity, the amount of output per hour of work, is not expected to last. But economists are hopeful that future gains will be stronger than the anemic performance of recent years. Economists say increasing productivity is the biggest challenge facing the economy currently and without an improvement the Trump administration's goal of boosting economic growth will not be realized.  The stronger productivity increases in the past two quarters followed a scant 0.1 percent gain in the first quarter this year. The improvement reflected the fact that overall output, as measured by the gross domestic product, accelerated sharply following a weak start to the year. GDP grew at an annual rate of 3 percent in the third quarter, the government reported last week, and that followed a 3.1 percent rise in the second quarter. It was the first back-to-back GDP gains of 3 percent or better in three years.  Productivity actually declined in 2016, dropping 0.1 percent. It was the first annual decline in 34 years and followed a string of weak annual performances since the economy emerged from the Great Recession in mid-2009.  Productivity has averaged annual gains of just 1.2 percent from 2007 through 2016, a sharp slowdown from average annual gains of 2.6 percent from 2000 to 20007, increases that reflected a boost from increased use of computers and the internet in the workplace.  Rising productivity means increased output for each hour of work, which allows employers to boost wages without triggering higher inflation.  The challenge of boosting productivity back to the levels before the 2007-2009 Great Recession will be a key factor determining whether President Donald Trump can achieve his goal of boosting overall growth from the modest average annual gains of 2.2 percent seen during the current recovery, which is now in its ninth year.  During the campaign, Trump promised to double growth to 4 percent or better. His budget forecasts a still ambitious increase to gains of 3 percent per year as Trump's economic program of tax cuts, deregulation and tougher enforcement of trade laws takes effect.

In an article titled, “Why Did The Advocate Redact Kevin Spacey’s Name in 2001?” the magazine revealed that despite the fact they knew of Spacey’s alleged sexual misconduct with 14-year-old Rapp, they chose to keep his identity hidden.  “In 2001, Rent actor Anthony Rapp and Dennis Hensley — a former freelance writer for The Advocate — were both promoting CD releases at the time. Hensley believed he asked the LGBT magazine’s then-editor in chief, Bruce C. Steele, for ‘a little online space’ to help promote these projects,” the Advocate explained in their article. “But at one point during the brief back-and-forth, Rapp broached the topic of closeted actors. And a bombshell dropped. ‘That makes me think of [a certain leading man] in [a certain award-winning film],’ said Hensley at the time — the name and film were redacted in the final published article.”  In response, Rapp reportedly declared, “It’s hard for me to evaluate his acting because I’m so angry at him… I met him when I was 14 because we were both in plays and he invited me to a party at his house. I was bored, so I was in his bedroom watching TV and didn’t know everybody had left, and he came to the bedroom and he picked me up and lay down on top of me.”  “Oh, my God! What did you do?” replied Hensley in 2001.  “I squirmed away and went into the bathroom,” Rapp claimed. “I came out and I excused myself, and he’s like ‘You sure you want to go?’ I always wonder if he remembers it, because he was pretty drunk. And he’s had so many.”  In their article, the Advocate then attempted to justify the reason why they didn’t release Spacey’s identity.  “Hensley’s memory is fuzzy about the conversation with Steele, regarding how Spacey’s name was redacted. He said he may have been ‘seasoned enough’ at the time to not even type Spacey’s name in his first draft, because he knew ‘it would never run’ if he did,” they explained, with Hensley reportedly claiming, “It just felt like a lot more of a legal mess than we’d want to get into. We weren’t doing a big exposé. We were just having a conversation about music and stuff. It didn’t seem like the time or the place to try to break that big nugget.”  The Advocate also pointed towards their “no outing” policy, claiming they would only out a closeted gay celebrity if it were a “criminal case,” which they decided Spacey’s wasn’t.  This month, BuzzFeed published Anthony Rapp’s allegations against Spacey in full, without redaction, prompting Netflix to postpone production of the new season of House of Cards, which stars Spacey in the leading role.  Since the release of Rapp’s story, others have also made similar accusations against Spacey.  Charlie Nash covers technology and LGBT news for Breitbart News.

Like what you’re reading? Sign up to get VoxCare in your inbox here.  This week, I listened to what 16 Trump voters thought about a single-payer, Medicare-for-all health care program.  Most of these folks don't trust the government to run a health care system and don't believe philosophically it should. They are worried about their taxes going up. They are worried about losing the health insurance they've got now and they like.  But there was one surprise in these groups, which took place near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and were run by opinion researcher Michael Perry. Her name was Kate.  Kate, who said she works in sales, didn't like her current insurance. She gave it a 3 out of 10; she said her deductibles had ""skyrocketed.  ""I have had to struggle to pay for my insurance,"" she said.  The most revealing moment came when Mike asked everybody if they thought health care was a right. A few said yes. A few said no. Kate was last.  This is what she said:  I’m conflicted. I’m truly conflicted. You say the government shouldn’t be in medical care, but it is — Medicare, Social Security. You’re talking about the lower to middle class. You are stuck in the middle, paying taxes they don’t reap benefits from. I don’t want to say it’s not fair. But I don’t see any way out of that, unless you go to a single-payer system. I am truly a die-hard Republican. But over the last few years, I wonder about a single-payer system, something like the Canadian system. I want people who don’t have health care to have health care.  Toward the end of the meeting, Mike came to Kate again. She elaborated a little bit on where she was coming from.  There's inability to move forward with anything, and in health care we’re talking about human beings’ lives here. It’s like food. Everybody should have food, and I really think people should not have to worry about going to the doctor. That should be one thing taken away from their daily worries. Maybe the government could find something.  But she shared some of the same concerns as her peers, particularly about the government's ability to run a health care program well.  I think it should be debated because I think it could have a place. But I really worry about the bureaucrats getting their hands on it. They like paper and they like to generate more of it.  I should emphasize again: Kate was the exception. The other Trump voters we spoke with believed, as a matter of principle, that the government is not responsible for everybody's health care. Or they simply didn't trust the government to run a program effectively. They had heard horror stories about other countries' health care systems, long waiting lists and the like.  This also wasn't quantitative research. We talked to 16 people — enough to get some impressions, hardly a rigorous national survey.  But Kate was a useful reminder that even an issue this divisive and ostensibly partisan doesn't break down strictly on party lines. We know from the Kaiser Family Foundation that about one-quarter of Republicans say they would favor a single-payer system. There are other Kates.  Her frustrations with the status quo and this conflict between her ideological beliefs and what she actually thinks might help to alleviate those frustrations, and could tell us something about where the health care debate is heading.  vox-mark VoxCare Vox's email explaining the biggest news in health care, edited by Sarah Kliff Subscribe By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy.

The revelation came about after someone posted on Twitter about discovering the feature when she typed “brassiere” into the Photos app search bar of her smartphone.  “Attention all girls,” Twitter user @ellieeewbu wrote. “Go to your photos and type in the ‘Brassiere’ why are apple saving these and made it a folder!!??!!?” (sic).  The puzzling tweet has already been retweeted more than 12,000 times and is raising a few eyebrows.  User @Sophoejade98_ also tweeted: “Typing brassiere into you photo album search bar and seeing what photos Apple have saved in that file freaks me out a bit.”  Another user asked: “How do we keep this from happening? I feel really really violated.”  Women have been responding to the tweet posting screenshots with similar results, many tweeted they were alarmed to learn about the feature displaying intimate images of themselves.  Chrissy Teigen also investigated, sharing a screenshot of her “brassiere” search.  However, that’s not exactly what’s going on. Apple isn’t actually saving the photos in a specific folder — they are simply being stored locally on your device, The Verge reports.  The little-known feature was introduced with the launch of i0S 10 in mid-2016 when Apple’s iPhone Photos app began using metadata analysis and image-recognition technology to sort users’ photos automatically and tag them for easy extraction.  There are thousands of objects your iPhone can identify. Categories include everything from various animals, food and fashion to inanimate objects like furniture and all of those sunset snaps you’ve taken.  Weirdly though, despite not having categories for “nude,” or “underwear,” there are plenty categories for bra: brassiere, bandeau, bandeaus, bra, bras, and brassieres.  The function actually makes rifling through all the photos on your phone a whole lot easier. However, it seems many iPhone users were unaware it even existed. Hence the panic.  So don’t worry, your NSFW pics are totally safe.  This story originally appeared in the New York Post.",2.0625,16,"[0.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 1.5, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 2.5, 0.5, 1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 0.5, 4.0]"
1307,2906,11,2,2017,2017-11-02,Breitbart,Twitter Confesses to Burying Nearly 50% of #DNCLeak Tweets,"Twitter “hid” nearly 50 percent of tweets bearing the hashtag #DNCLeak along with a quarter of those with #PodestaEmails during the last two months of the 2016 presidential campaign, according to new testimony from Twitter’s general counsel.  On Oct. 31, the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism heard testimony from Twitter general counsel Sean Edgett in its investigation of possible Russian interference in the 2016 election.  Edgett said that Twitter systems concealed substantial numbers of tweets relating to hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee as well as from Clinton campaign chair John Podesta, despite the fact that it knew that only a tiny percentage of these could have even “potential links to Russia.”  “We found that slightly under 4% of Tweets containing #PodestaEmails came from accounts with potential links to Russia,” Edgett said in his written testimony, whereas of tweets bearing the #DNCLeak, “roughly 2% were from potentially Russian-linked accounts,” he said.  Despite the low correlation between those hashtags and possible Russian involvement, Twitter hid 48 percent of tweets with the #DNCLeak hashtag and 25 percent of tweets with #PodestaEmails, Edgett said.  In his testimony, Edgett made no mention of another important hashtag, namely the plural “#DNCLeaks.”  As Breitbart News reported in the summer of 2016, users accused Twitter of censoring WikiLeaks’ DNC email release by swapping the trending #DNCLeaks hashtag with the far less popular singular #DNCLeak.  #DNCLeaks was one of the top trending topics on Twitter on July 22 with over 250,000 tweets reportedly made under the hashtag after the WikiLeaks release of more than 19,000 leaked emails from the Democratic National Committee.  Later on in the day, however, the hashtag reportedly disappeared from the trending bar for some 20 minutes, before reappearing under the less popular hashtag “#DNCleak.”  “The change meant that those investigating the new trending hashtag would not see all of the other posts tagged under the previous version, effectively hiding over 250,000 tweets from the public,” the report noted.  None of this came up in Edgett’s testimony Tuesday, which adds further questions to the already egregious partisan censorship that Twitter seems guilty of.  Edgett said that prior to the election, “we also detected and took action on activity relating to hashtags that have since been reported as manifestations of efforts to interfere with the 2016 election,” even though what he calls “interference” was in the majority of cases a simple effort to “influence” the election by providing damning true information about the Hillary Clinton campaign, which is a normal thing during presidential campaigns.  WikiLeaks released the DNC and Podesta emails throughout the election, which were especially damaging to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.  Follow Thomas D.

1306,2905,11,2,2017,2017-11-02,Fox News,Grover Norquist: Republican tax bill is an amazingly powerful job creation measure,"House Republicans have unveiled tax reform and reduction legislation that is also an amazingly powerful job creation bill.  After eight years of the slowest “recovery” in modern American history, we are now poised to create millions of jobs and move from our Obama-era 2 percent economic growth rate to our historic average of 3 percent growth and beyond. President Reagan’s growth rates were over 4 percent. We will match and likely surpass that.  Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, who is chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, focused on designing tax reform that put economic growth first and foremost.  Every decision was focused on “what creates the most jobs and income increases for Americans” and “how do we make this permanent,” so we do not have a repeat of the 2012 disappearing tax cuts, when the Bush-era tax cuts expired.  What would the GOP plan do if it becomes law?  It would double the standard deduction from $12,000 for a married couple to $24,000. This makes the claim by Democrats that this legislation raises taxes on middle-income Americans look foolish. Heck, even the Washington Post “fact checker” called out the Democrats for faking the numbers to suggest this is not a tax cut for the vast majority of Americans, in a story headlined: “Senate Democrats falsely claim GOP tax plan will raise taxes for most working-class families.”  The tax bill would also cut rates for all Americans. The new rates would be 0 percent, 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent and 39.6 percent. Yes, the top rate would still be the same as what we have now (all the others would be reduced), but it wouldn’t kick in until an income of $1 million for a couple.  The death tax would be abolished. First, it would be reduced by doubling the exempt amount of your life savings not taxed for the next six years. Then the death tax would die in 2024. If even a small piece of the death tax survived the knife, it would live to grow back to hit millions of Americans.  The alternative minimum tax would be abolished. That was imposed in 1969 to hit 115 people and now hits several million.  Business taxes that are now at 35 percent for American companies – one of the highest rates in the world – would fall to 20 percent immediately. China is at 25 percent. Canada is at 15 percent. Britain at 18 percent. We are not now competitive in the world economy due to our high business tax. This bill would change that.  Manufacturing would rebound because the tax bill would allow businesses to expense all new business investment in the first year, rather than over a decade or more. That drops the cost of new investment in job-creating, income-enhancing technology.  Lower taxes. Simpler. Pro-growth. Pro-jobs.  The next step is to move the legislation through the House Ways and Means Committee, which should happen quickly because the members were part of writing the bill, and then through the full House.  The Senate, which would need to join the House in passing the legislation for it to go to President Trump to be signed into law, has been involved in designing this bill from the start. As has the White House. That is why the House-Senate conference should be easier and shorter than usual and President Trump’s signature should be assured.  The president called the tax legislation “a great bill” when it was unveiled Thursday and said his administration is “working to give the American people a giant tax cut for Christmas.”  Yes, this is a tax cut bill. It is most importantly a job-creation, income-increasing bill.  It is also a powerful political move that will guarantee the GOP holds the House of Representatives and wins four or five additional Senate seats.  And keep in mind that every year the GOP holds Congress and White House there will be another tax cut. Four tax cuts in the next four years. So this bill is just a start.

1304,2903,11,2,2017,2017-11-02,Vox,"Donna Brazile’s bombshell about the DNC and Hillary Clinton, explained","A former Democratic National Committee chair on Thursday revealed the existence of a previously secret agreement that appeared to confirm some of Bernie Sanders supporters’ fears about the 2016 Democratic primary.  Donna Brazile, a longtime Clinton ally who stepped in as DNC chair last year in the wake of Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s resignation, published an excerpt of her upcoming book in Politico in which she disclosed the details of a fundraising agreement between the DNC and the Clinton campaign reached in August 2015.  “The agreement — signed by Amy Dacey, the former CEO of the DNC, and [Clinton campaign manager] Robby Mook with a copy to [Clinton campaign counsel] Marc Elias— specified that in exchange for raising money and investing in the DNC, Hillary would control the party’s finances, strategy, and all the money raised,” Brazile wrote in the story under the headline “Inside Hillary Clinton’s Secret Takeover of the DNC.”  Brazile added of the deal: “[Clinton’s] campaign had the right of refusal of who would be the party communications director, and it would make final decisions on all the other staff. The DNC also was required to consult with the campaign about all other staffing, budgeting, data, analytics, and mailings.”  During the 2016 election, Sanders allies alleged that the DNC did not act as a neutral arbiter of the Democratic primary, favoring Clinton in its selection of debate times and fundraising. Their suspicions were only heightened when leaked emails published by WikiLeaks, and now reported to have been hacked by the Russians, appeared to show DNC staffers deriding Sanders and plotting ways to help Clinton. The accusations grew so heated that Wasserman Schultz resigned, which is when Brazile took over.  But now Brazile has provided explosive new evidence for the initial allegations. ""The shocking news here is this idea they were exerting a level of control over DNC affairs that we didn't know about,"" said Kenneth Pennington, who served as digital director for the Sanders campaign. ""If you had told me this during the primary — that they're using the joint fundraising committee to get veto power over DNC functions — I would have called you a conspiracy nut.""  The debate over how the DNC acted has made Sanders supporters furious all over again. But though the revelations dredge up old tensions from the Democratic primary, they may also counterintuitively show that the party is trying to heal old wounds — and bring Sanders supporters into the fold.  What Brazile’s revelation is — and isn’t  There’s been a lot of confusion about the significance of Brazile’s allegations since her story was published. Brazile did not allege, as CNN reported in this chyron, that the DNC “robbed” Sanders of the nomination. She also did not claim to have been shocked by the existence of a fundraising agreement between Clinton and the DNC, since that agreement has been public for at least two years.  Instead, Brazile’s account is explosive for what it tells us — for the first time — about the nature of the fundraising agreement between Clinton and the DNC. What she charges is that the DNC, when starved for financial resources, agreed to trade a seemingly large part of its autonomy for Clinton’s help raising money — and that this agreement was inked in August 2015, long before voting in the 2016 Democratic primary had even begun.  Now, this deal does not guarantee that Sanders would have won the nomination without the obstruction of the DNC, as his supporters have long alleged. But it does at least suggest that Clinton’s team had veto power over some of the DNC’s decisions during the primary. Brazile writes that she concluded this was “proof” that Democrats tipped the nomination against Sanders, and that she told him about the agreement in a phone call before the general election. (Brazile herself had been implicated in tipping the scales of the primary after it was revealed she had given Clinton parts of debate questions ahead of time.)  “I had promised Bernie when I took the helm of the Democratic National Committee after the convention that I would get to the bottom of whether Hillary Clinton’s team had rigged the nomination process,” Brazile wrote. After discovering the document, she said, “I had found my proof and it broke my heart.”  A brief lesson in joint fundraising committees  The key to understanding Brazile’s conclusion and the current controversy is to understand the unusual fundraising apparatus at its center: the joint fundraising committee.  JFCs exist as a clever loophole to skirt existing campaign finance laws. Under current law, the most an individual donor can give to a presidential campaign committee is $2,700 per election. An individual donor can also give up to $33,400 to the DNC, and up to $10,000 to each state party committee.  But by existing as a group, the ""joint committee"" can get a big fat check that would be far too large for it to legally receive if its members were fundraising alone, according to Bob Biersack, a senior fellow at the Center for Responsive Politics. So a single donor could give around $353,000 to the Hillary Victory Fund, on the principle that money would go to the presidential committee, the DNC, and 32 state parties.  Now, the JFCs aren’t loved by campaign finance or good-government experts, but they’re not entirely out of the ordinary. Before his grassroots fundraising juggernaut took off, for instance, Sanders also had an agreement for a joint fundraising committee with the DNC. Donald Trump has a joint fundraising agreement with the Republican National Committee. They’re effective ways to tap donors who can give much more than $2,700.  And when Clinton’s JFC began, it appeared that all three parties involved had a great deal of mutual interest: Clinton would bring her big-money donors to the table, giving groups like the Democratic Party of Utah access to George Clooney’s wallet that it would never otherwise get. In exchange, Clinton could broaden her fundraising pitch by saying — as she did on several occasions — that she was raising money not just for herself but for the benefit of the entire Democratic Party.  But then it turned out that the money was not being shared between the three parties. Reporting by Politico showed that 99 percent of the money raised by the committee ended up going to the DNC or to Clinton's campaign directly. Some of the state party chairs objected — often anonymously, for fear of reprisal from national Democrats — but the DNC defended an agreement that appeared to starve it of resources and direct them almost entirely to Clinton’s team.  At the time, both Sanders and campaign finance experts thought Clinton was avoiding the spirit if not the letter of the law. ""It's a circumvention of the contribution limits on the national party,"" Michael Malbin, executive director of the Campaign Finance Institute, told me at the time. ""The victim here is anybody who thinks there's anything meaningful left to contribution limits.""  But the document revealed by Brazile adds a new dimension to this story, suggesting that the Clinton team had control over the DNC throughout this fundraising process that cut out the state parties.  Some Democrats are trying to incorporate Sanders’s movement into the party’s mainstream  When news that Clinton’s joint fundraising money was mostly going back to her campaign emerged in 2016, Sanders alleged in a public debate that Clinton and the DNC had agreed to a “money laundering scheme.” And when Brazile’s story came out on Thursday, Sanders supporters were livid, with the senator’s former digital fundraising director tweeting that Bernie’s campaign was “right the entire time”:  We were right the entire time. pic.twitter.com/Z62qwA3liZ — Michael Whitney (@michaelwhitney) November 2, 2017  But overall, since the 2016 election, mainstream Democrats and Sanders have taken several key steps to ease tensions in the party. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer elevated Sanders to a leadership position within the caucus. Sanders campaigned across the country to save Obamacare, winning plaudits from national Democrats. Seventeen Senate Democrats signed on to Sanders’s Medicare-for-all health care bill.  This is one way to read Brazile’s revelation: as yet another sign that the Democratic establishment is trying to incorporate Sanders and his movement, by publicly distancing itself from those who allegedly tipped the scales of the primary away from him.  “Maybe Brazile just wants to maximize sales of her upcoming book, and recognized that an inside story of DNC treachery was the juiciest angle she had,” Eric Levitz writes in New York magazine. “But this certainly reads like the kind of piece a Democratic operative would write if she were interested in having as warm a relationship with the Sanders 2020 campaign as she did with the Clinton 2016 one.”  On Thursday, some pundits wondered why Democrats would spend time relitigating the 2016 primary rather than fighting the GOP’s new tax bill.  But Levitz may be right. Perhaps Brazile’s willingness to distance herself from the DNC’s conduct will only exacerbate intra-left squabbling. Or maybe it’s a sign that Democratic strategists see more upside in confirming Sanders supporters’ beliefs than deepening their animosities.",3.6417910447761193,67,"[5.0, 1.5, 4.0, 5.0, 1.5, 4.5, 4.5, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 0.5, 3.0, 4.5, 2.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 2.5, 1.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.0, 5.0, 1.5, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.0, 4.0, 4.0, 3.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 4.0, 5.0, 0.5, 5.0, 5.0, 3.0, 3.5, 3.0, 2.5, 5.0, 2.5, 5.0]"

The phrase strengthened the views that the Fed was due to hike interest rates in December. President Donald Trump is expected to name the successor to Fed Chair Janet Yellen later in the day.

U.S. officials are reconsidering whether federal protections are needed for the rare, cold-water insect after scientists confirmed its presence in previously-unknown locations in Wyoming and Montana. (Joe Giersch/U.S. Geological Survey via AP, File)  BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — U.S. wildlife managers are revisiting a pending proposal to protect a rare, cold-water insect, after scientists confirmed its presence in new locations in Wyoming and Montana, officials said Wednesday.  The newly found populations of western glacier stonefly appear to face the same problem as the original population in and around Glacier National Park, where habitat loss due to climate change is reducing water flows in the mountain streams where the insects live.  “We expect climate change to be acting range-wide, even in these new habitats that were found,” said biologist Jim Boyd with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  The winged insects live along streams fed by melting glaciers and snowfields. They’ve recently been confirmed in Montana’s Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness and Wyoming’s Grand Teton National Park.  The glacier stonefly and another species known as the meltwater lednian stonefly were proposed for protections under the Endangered Species Act in October 2016. A final decision was expected last month, but that’s now been put off until early 2018 as the government considers the new information on the glacier stonefly, officials said.  Boyd said one species could be given protections but not the other.  By 2030, the amount of stream habitat available to the meltwater lednian stonefly is expected to decrease more than 80 percent. Similar habitat losses are projected for the western glacier stonefly.

[VIDEO]  Remember that Geraldo insulted Geller when she was almost killed by two jihadists in Texas…  Geller has long been a target of radical Islamists. Her life has been threatened but she keeps up the fight:  Pam Geller has been spot on when speaking about the truth of jihadists. She spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about how she feels Hollywood is “in the pocket” of jihadis. Very interesting read and lots to learn from this very brave lady:  Pamela Geller has been on a rampage against radical Islam for years, beginning notably in 2010 by spearheading of the opposition to what she called the “Ground Zero Mega Mosque” near the site of the destroyed World Trade Center. Her most recent controversy was the organization of a “Draw the Prophet Muhammad” contest in Texas.  At the event, two self-described jihadists shot a security guard before police killed them. Then, on June 2, police killed a knife-wielding Muslim man in Boston whose goal was allegedly to behead Geller in retaliation for the contest. Even though the contest was a major news story, few media outlets published the winning cartoon. Geller’s group, American Freedom Defense Initiative, put the image on billboards, 100 of which debuted in St. Louis on Monday with the tagline “Support Free Speech.” She spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about how the (largely hostile) media is portraying these events.  Why are you being overly provocative, purposely insulting Muslims?  I am not being overly provocative or purposely insulting Muslims. Islamic jihadists, not I, made Muhammad cartoons the flash point for the defense of the freedom of speech when they began killing over them. If we don’t stand against them on that point, the only alternative is surrender and submission. I did not make the cartoons a flash point, the jihadis did.  But if you just don’t insult their prophet, they’ll leave you alone, no?  No. The death penalty for insulting Muhammad is just one aspect of Sharia. There is much, much more of infidel behavior that violates Sharia. If we refrain from drawing Muhammad, more demands to adhere to other aspects of Sharia will follow. Millions are suffering or have been slaughtered under Islamic Sharia law in Muslim countries. Islamic supremacists mean to impose it in the West.  There is no hate speech exception to the First Amendment. “Hate speech” is a subjective judgment. If it were outlawed, the authority with the power to decide what constitutes it would have the power to control the public debate.… If a group will not bear being offended without resorting to violence, that group will rule unopposed while everyone else lives in fear, while other groups curtail their activities to appease the violent group. This results in the violent group being able to tyrannize the others. Cartoons have been used as satire since the beginning of satire — especially in our country — and no one gets a pass. Not the Pope of Rome, president of the United States or Hollywood’s biggest movie stars.… If you don’t like it, don’t look at it, boycott the network that airs it, don’t buy the publication, make counter-images, make a million, fine, but you have to adjust to us, not we to you, and if that’s too much, don’t come here. Threaten violence? Commit violence? The consequences are yours to bear.  It seems many media pundits who claim allegiance to the First Amendment aren’t persuaded by your arguments.  They are afraid of being killed by Islamic jihadists and camouflage their fear and cowardice as “respect” for Islam and Muslims.  Are there any TV hosts who have been particularly hostile to you during interviews?  Yes. Martha MacCallum, Erin Burnett, Alisyn Camerota, Chris Cuomo — although he let me speak and make my case.  How about behind your back?  Yes. Bill O’Reilly and Laura Ingraham. They said I was insulting the entire religion, one held by our moderate allies such as Egypt and Qatar. They are wrong in assuming that we must submit to Sharia to placate moderates, rather than that moderates need to accept the freedom of speech. Roman Catholics don’t like their religion mocked or the mockery of other religions, but Roman Catholics don’t kill when their religion is mocked — and so no one talks about “provoking” them or “respecting” them. In any pluralistic society, we have to put up with being offended and even with our core beliefs being mocked. Roman Catholics have learned that. Mormons and others have learned that — look at The Book of Mormon on Broadway. Why must we condescend to Muslims and think they cannot learn that? It’s the low expectation of soft bigotry.  So this isn’t entirely a partisan issue where conservatives stand by you and liberals don’t?  No. Chris Hayes stuck up for me on MSNBC. This is not a left/right split, it is a free person/slave split.  Did any TV host say something that struck you as particularly wrongheaded?  They all say I have the right to draw Muhammad but shouldn’t out of respect. They don’t seem to realize that any surrender on this point will only be seen by the jihadists as a victory and embolden them to make more demands. CNN’s Erin Burnett said I relished being the target of a beheading. It’s madness. Who self-promotes to get killed?  So you’re not purposely courting danger, as Burnett and others have insinuated?  Of course not. I love life. But I will not live as a slave.  Are there any TV hosts you’d like to face off with but who won’t have you on?  Bill O’Reilly. I expect he knows he would be shown up.  We know about the man arrested who intended to behead you. Any other threats you can share?  I have received many threats. The FBI and NYPD are aware of them and on the case.  Anyone in Hollywood reach out to you to offer support?  No.  Should Hollywood care about threats against you?  They may think they’re exempt, but they aren’t. Islamic supremacists will be demanding they adhere to Sharia as well. Of course, most producers already are careful not to show anything that might offend Muslims, including accurate representations of jihad plotting and activity, so Hollywood is mostly already in their pocket. But this is their issue, and the entertainment industry should be on the front lines in the information battle space. The jihadists aren’t just coming for me, they are coming for all of us that believe in freedom.  So why do you think Hollywood, which routinely claims to push the envelope in its art, hasn’t supported you?  They’re afraid of being ostracized.  Your “Draw Muhammad” event certainly got a lot of news coverage. Should mainstream media outlets have published the winning cartoon?  Every media outlet should publish the Muhammad cartoons. They can’t kill us all. By kowtowing to violent intimidation, they are inviting more of it. Instead, they should be showing that we will all stand together for free speech. If the media had published the Danish cartoons back in 2005, this would never have become an issue. The submission by media, entertainment and academic elites empowered the savages.  The Southern Poverty Law Center included you on their list of “hate groups.” Are they right?  Of course not. They’re the hate group, using that label to demonize and stigmatize all who don’t share their hard-left agenda. The SPLC smear machine does not profile jihad groups, but they target and libel patriots, veterans, Tea Party organizations and other groups that work in defense of freedom. They named [Republican presidential contender] Ben Carson as a hate group. That should tell you everything you need to know about them. Their [sympathizers] have violently attacked family groups, and one tried to assassinate Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council.

1283,2882,11,2,2017,2017-11-02,Associated Press News,"Russia hackers pursued Putin foes, not just US Democrats"," It wasn’t just Hillary Clinton’s emails they went after.  The hackers who disrupted the U.S. presidential election last year had ambitions that stretched across the globe, targeting the emails of Ukrainian officers, Russian opposition figures, U.S. defense contractors and thousands of others of interest to the Kremlin, according to a previously unpublished digital hit list obtained by The Associated Press.  The list provides the most detailed forensic evidence yet of the close alignment between the hackers and the Russian government, exposing an operation that went back years and tried to break into the inboxes of 4,700 Gmail users — from the pope’s representative in Kiev to the punk band Pussy Riot in Moscow. The targets were spread among 116 countries.  “It’s a wish list of who you’d want to target to further Russian interests,” said Keir Giles, director of the Conflict Studies Research Center in Cambridge, England, and one of five outside experts who reviewed the AP’s findings. He said the data was “a master list of individuals whom Russia would like to spy on, embarrass, discredit or silence.”  The AP findings draw on a database of 19,000 malicious links collected by cybersecurity firm Secureworks, dozens of rogue emails, and interviews with more than 100 hacking targets.  Secureworks stumbled upon the data after a hacking group known as Fancy Bear accidentally exposed part of its phishing operation to the internet. The list revealed a direct line between the hackers and the leaks that rocked the presidential contest in its final stages, most notably the private emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.  The issue of who hacked the Democrats is back in the national spotlight following the revelation Monday that a Donald Trump campaign official, George Papadopoulos, was briefed early last year that the Russians had “dirt” on Clinton, including “thousands of emails.”  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the notion that Russia interfered “unfounded.” But the list examined by AP provides powerful evidence that the Kremlin did just that.  “This is the Kremlin and the general staff,” said Andras Racz, a specialist in Russian security policy at Pazmany Peter Catholic University in Hungary, as he examined the data.  “I have no doubts.”  ___  THE NEW EVIDENCE  Secureworks’ list covers the period between March 2015 and May 2016. Most of the identified targets were in the United States, Ukraine, Russia, Georgia and Syria.  In the United States, which was Russia’s Cold War rival, Fancy Bear tried to pry open at least 573 inboxes belonging to those in the top echelons of the country’s diplomatic and security services: then-Secretary of State John Kerry, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, then-NATO Supreme Commander, U.S. Air Force Gen. Philip Breedlove, and one of his predecessors, U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark.  The list skewed toward workers for defense contractors such as Boeing, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin or senior intelligence figures, prominent Russia watchers and — especially — Democrats. More than 130 party workers, campaign staffers and supporters of the party were targeted, including Podesta and other members of Clinton’s inner circle.  The AP also found a handful of Republican targets.  Podesta, Powell, Breedlove and more than a dozen Democratic targets besides Podesta would soon find their private correspondence dumped to the web. The AP has determined that all had been targeted by Fancy Bear, most of them three to seven months before the leaks.  “They got two years of email,” Powell recently told AP. He said that while he couldn’t know for sure who was responsible, “I always suspected some Russian connection.”  In Ukraine, which is fighting a grinding war against Russia-backed separatists, Fancy Bear attempted to break into at least 545 accounts, including those of President Petro Poroshenko and his son Alexei, half a dozen current and former ministers such as Interior Minister Arsen Avakov and as many as two dozen current and former lawmakers.  The list includes Serhiy Leshchenko, an opposition parliamentarian who helped uncover the off-the-books payments allegedly made to Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort — whose indictment was unsealed Monday in Washington.  In Russia, Fancy Bear focused on government opponents and dozens of journalists. Among the targets were oil tycoon-turned-Kremlin foe Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who spent a decade in prison and now lives in exile, and Pussy Riot’s Maria Alekhina. Along with them were 100 more civil society figures, including anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny and his lieutenants.  “Everything on this list fits,” said Vasily Gatov, a Russian media analyst who was himself among the targets. He said Russian authorities would have been particularly interested in Navalny, one of the few opposition leaders with a national following.  Many of the targets have little in common except that they would have been crossing the Kremlin’s radar: an environmental activist in the remote Russian port city of Murmansk; a small political magazine in Armenia; the Vatican’s representative in Kiev; an adult education organization in Kazakhstan.  “It’s simply hard to see how any other country would be particularly interested in their activities,” said Michael Kofman, an expert on Russian military affairs at the Woodrow Wilson International Center in Washington. He was also on the list.  “If you’re not Russia,” he said, “hacking these people is a colossal waste of time.”  ___  WORKING 9 TO 6 MOSCOW TIME  Allegations that Fancy Bear works for Russia aren’t new. But raw data has been hard to come by.  Researchers have been documenting the group’s activities for more than a decade and many have accused it of being an extension of Russia’s intelligence services. The “Fancy Bear” nickname is a none-too-subtle reference to Russia’s national symbol.  In the wake of the 2016 election, U.S. intelligence agencies publicly endorsed the consensus view, saying what American spooks had long alleged privately: Fancy Bear is a creature of the Kremlin.  But the U.S. intelligence community provided little proof, and even media-friendly cybersecurity companies typically publish only summaries of their data.  That makes the Secureworks’ database a key piece of public evidence — all the more remarkable because it’s the result of a careless mistake.  Secureworks effectively stumbled across it when a researcher began working backward from a server tied to one of Fancy Bear’s signature pieces of malicious software.  He found a hyperactive Bitly account that Fancy Bear (which Secureworks calls “Iron Twilight”) was using to sneak thousands of malicious links past Google’s spam filter. Because Fancy Bear forgot to set the account to private, Secureworks spent the next few months hovering over the group’s shoulder, quietly copying down the details of the thousands of emails it was targeting.  The AP obtained the data recently, boiling it down to 4,700 individual email addresses, and then connecting roughly half to account holders. The AP validated the list by running it against a sample of phishing emails obtained from people targeted and comparing it to similar rosters gathered independently by other cybersecurity companies, such as Tokyo-based Trend Micro and the Slovakian firm ESET .  The Secureworks data allowed reporters to determine that more than 95 percent of the malicious links were generated during Moscow office hours — between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. Monday to Friday.  The AP’s findings also track with a report that first brought Fancy Bear to the attention of American voters. In 2016, a cybersecurity company known as CrowdStrike said the Democratic National Committee had been compromised by Russian hackers, including Fancy Bear.  Secureworks’ roster shows Fancy Bear making aggressive attempts to hack into DNC technical staffers’ emails in early April 2016 — exactly when CrowdStrike says the hackers broke in.  And the raw data enabled the AP to speak directly to the people who were targeted, many of whom pointed the finger at the Kremlin.  “We have no doubts about who is behind these attacks,” said Artem Torchinskiy, a project coordinator with Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Fund who was targeted three times in 2015. “I am sure these are hackers controlled by Russian secret services.”  ___  THE MYTH OF THE 400-POUND MAN  Even if only a small fraction of the 4,700 Gmail accounts targeted by Fancy Bear were hacked successfully, the data drawn from them could run into terabytes — easily rivaling the biggest known leaks in journalistic history.  For the hackers to have made sense of that mountain of messages — in English, Ukrainian, Russian, Georgian, Arabic and many other languages — they would have needed a substantial team of analysts and translators. Merely identifying and sorting the targets took six AP reporters eight weeks of work.  The AP’s effort offers “a little feel for how much labor went into this,” said Thomas Rid, a professor of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies.  In response to the AP’s investigation, the DNC issued a statement saying the evidence that Russia had interfered in the election was “irrefutable.”  Rid said the investigation should put to rest any theories like the one then-candidate Donald Trump floated last year that the hacks could be the work of “someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.”  “The notion that it’s just a lone hacker somewhere is utterly absurd,” Rid said.  ___  Donn reported from Plymouth, Massachusetts.

Another two union bigwigs from the nation’s second largest union, the Services Employees International Union (SEIU) have been accused of sexual misconduct and abusive behavior toward female staff members. The resignation of Kendall Fells — a top national leader for the union’s “Fight for $15” minimum wage campaign — and the firing of SEIU Detroit leader Mark Raleigh comes on the heels of the controversial resignation of chief strategist of “Fight for $15,” SEIU Executive Vice President Scott Courtney resigning amid allegations against him of sexual misconduct.  “These personnel actions are the culmination of this stage of the investigation which brought to light the serious problems related to abusive behavior towards staff, predominantly female staff,” an SEIU spokeswoman said to Bloomberg.com.  This brings the total number of ousted SEIU officials of abuse allegations to four. Along with Courtney, Fells and Raleigh, Caleb Jennings, head of the “Fight for $15” Chicago chapter was fired last week after he was accused of misconduct and abusive behavior.  “Hollywood’s skeletons may be falling out of the closet, but the movie industry is certainly not alone,” Luka Ladan, communications director at the Center for Union Facts said to Fox News. “Despite talking the talk on sexual harassment, the SEIU’s walk has exposed female employees to terrible consequences. Perhaps the union should clean up its glass house before throwing stones at other employers.”  According to a recent report from BuzzFeed News, current and former SEIU staffers have come forward and said that complaints about top-level “Fight for $15” staff was an “open secret,” and that no action ever was taken on filed complaints.  Last month, Courtney, who had a history of dating subordinates, was suspended following his marriage to a union employee. The union was forced to launch an investigation into potential violations of an anti-nepotism policy.

Scientists have found a previously undiscovered hidden chamber in Egypt's Great Pyramid of Giza, the first such discovery in the structure since the 19th century. In a report published in the journal Nature on Thursday, Nov. 2, 2017, an international team says the 30-meter (yard) void deep within the pyramid is situated above the Grand Gallery, and has a similar cross-section. (AP Photo/Hassan Ammar, File)  CAIRO (AP) — Scientists say they have found a hidden chamber in Egypt’s Great Pyramid of Giza, in what would be the first such discovery in the structure since the 19th century and one likely to spark a new surge of interest in the pharaohs.  In an article published in the journal Nature on Thursday, an international team said the 30-meter (yard) void deep within the pyramid is situated above the structure’s Grand Gallery, and has a similar cross-section.  The purpose of the space is unclear, and it’s not yet known whether it was built with a function in mind or if it’s merely a gap in the pyramid’s architecture. Some experts say such empty spaces have been known for years.  “This is a premier,” said Mehdi Tayoubi, a co-founder of the ScanPyramids project and president of the Heritage Innovation Preservation Institute. “It could be composed of one or several structures... maybe it could be another Grand Gallery. It could be a chamber, it could be a lot of things.”  The scientists made the discovery using cosmic-ray imaging, recording the behavior of subatomic particles called muons that penetrate the rock similar to X-rays, only much deeper. Their paper was peer-reviewed before appearing in Nature, an international, interdisciplinary journal of science, and its results confirmed by other teams of scientists.  Chances of the space containing treasure or burial chambers are almost nil, said Aidan Dodson, an Egyptologist at the University of Bristol, but the discovery helps shed light on building techniques.  “The pyramid’s burial chamber and sarcophagus have already been discovered, so this new area was more likely kept empty above the Grand Gallery to reduce the weight of stone pressing down on its ceiling,” he said, adding that similar designs have been found in other pyramids.  Egypt’s former antiquities minister and famed archaeologist Zahi Hawass, who has been testing scanning methods and heads the government’s oversight panel for the new techniques, said that the area in question has been known of for years and thus does not constitute a discovery. He has long downplayed the usefulness of scans of ancient sites.  “The Great Pyramid is full of voids. We have to be careful how results are presented to the public,” he said, adding that one problem facing the international team is that it did not have an Egyptologist as a member. He said the chamber was likely empty space builders used to construct the rooms below.  “In order to construct the Grand Gallery, you had to have a hollow, or a big void in order to access it — you cannot build it without such a space,” he said. “Large voids exist between the stones and may have been left as construction gaps.”  The pyramid is also known as Khufu’s Pyramid for its builder, a 4th Dynasty pharaoh who reigned from 2509 to 2483 B.C. Visitors to the pyramid, on the outskirts of Cairo, can walk, hunched over, up a long tunnel to reach the Grand Gallery. The space announced by the scanning team does not appear to be connected to any known internal passages.  Scientists involved in the scanning called the find a “breakthrough” that highlighted the usefulness of modern particle physics in archaeology.  “It was hidden, I think, since the construction of the pyramid,” Tayoubi added.  The Great Pyramid, the last surviving wonder of the ancient world, has captivated visitors since it was built as a royal burial chamber some 4,500 years ago. Experts are still divided over how it and other pyramids were constructed, so even relatively minor discoveries generate great interest.  Late last year, for example, thermal scanning identified a major anomaly in the Great Pyramid — three adjacent stones at its base which registered higher temperatures than others.  Speculation that King Tutankhamun’s tomb contains additional antechambers stoked interest in recent years, before scans by ground-penetrating radar and other tools came up empty, raising doubts about the claim.  The muon scan is accomplished by planting special plates inside and around the pyramid to collect data on the particles, which rain down from the earth’s atmosphere. They pass through empty spaces but can be absorbed or deflected by harder surfaces, allowing scientists to study their trajectories and discern what is stone and what is not. Several plates were used to triangulate the void discovered in the Great Pyramid.  While the technology can detect large open spaces, it cannot discern what is inside, so it’s unclear if the empty space contains any objects. Tayoubi said the team plans now to work with others to come up with hypotheses about the area.  “The good news is that the void is there, and it’s very big,” he said.  ___  Follow Brian Rohan on Twitter at: www.twitter.com/brian_rohan",3.9166666666666665,12,"[4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 4.5]"

Kevin Brady, R-Texas, watch. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)  WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on the tax overhaul from House Republicans (all times local):  8:30 p.m.  President Donald Trump is praising the rollout of the GOP’s tax overhaul plan.  In a tweet, Trump writes, “The lobbyists are storming Capital Hill, but Republicans will hold strong and do what is right for America!”  Republican lawmakers introduced the more than 400-page bill earlier Thursday, which would lower the corporate tax rate and simplify the personal code.  Special interest groups in Washington are gearing up to influence the final legislation, which the White House hopes to have passed by the end of the year.  __  6:50 p.m.  A provision in the House Republican tax bill is igniting a battle over abortion.  The measure explicitly lets people designate “unborn children” as beneficiaries of 529 accounts. The language defines them as children “at any stage of development” in the womb.  The accounts are savings programs for future students’ college costs.  Anti-abortion groups are claiming the provision as a victory. March for Life says until now, tax law “has failed to acknowledge the unborn child.”  Abortion-rights advocates say people can already start the investment for future children by initiating it in a parent’s name and transferring the account to their child after it is born.  The Planned Parenthood Action Fund says inscribing the definition of “unborn children” into law is aimed at supporting opponents’ efforts to restrict abortion.  ___  5:20 p.m.  A budget watchdog group has crunched the numbers on the House GOP tax plan and has found that the bulk of the tax cuts go to businesses instead of individuals.  The measure cuts taxes by $1.5 trillion over the coming decade, mixing tax cuts for businesses and individuals with repeal of deductions and other tax breaks.  The Washington-based Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says corporations and other businesses get tax cuts netting out to about $1 trillion over that time while individuals receive net tax cuts totally about $300 billion. People inheriting multimillion-dollar estates would receive $172 billion.  The group complained that some of the provisions are jerry-rigged to lessen their cost in the first 10 years but are likely to be extended at greater cost to the $20 trillion U.S. debt.  ___  3:20 p.m.  President Donald Trump is planting a kiss on a symbol of the House Republican tax plan.  In a White House meeting with House Republican leaders and Republican members of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, the president had an enthusiastic response when he was shown two postcard-sized papers that some taxpayers would be able to use to file their taxes.  The president said, “great job!” and added that he didn’t know he was going to be given a prop. To show his approval, Trump kissed one of the postcards before giving it back to Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady.  Trump is trying to build momentum for the plan ahead of his trip to Asia. He says the bill is about tax cuts, tax reform and “it’s all about jobs.”  ___  2:13 p.m.  President Donald Trump is cheering the Republican Party’s plan to cut the corporate tax rate and efforts to simplify the tax code, and predicts it will earn Democratic votes.  Attending an event with House Speaker Paul Ryan and other lawmakers, Trump says: “This is a middle income tax reduction.”  Trump says many people will be able to file their taxes on a postcard should the plan become law.  Praising the drafters of the GOP tax plan released Thursday, Trump says he’ll be counting on the “great team” to keep up the momentum on tax reform as he embarks on a 12-day trip to Asia Friday.  Trump says he hopes to have the tax reform package signed into law by the end of the year.  ____  1:24 p.m.  Churches would gain the right to endorse political candidates and still retain their tax-free status under a provision in the House GOP’s tax overhaul plan.  The bill would repeal a 63-year-old law credited to former President Lyndon Johnson back when he served in the Senate.  Critics warn it could open a loophole that could funnel tax-free money into campaigns. The provision would cost $2 billion over the coming decade, according to congressional scorekeepers.  The Johnson amendment law prohibits tax-exempt charitable organizations such as churches from participating directly or indirectly in any political campaign to support or oppose a candidate. If the IRS determines that a group has violated the law, it can revoke its tax-exempt status.  The GOP plan permits political activity by churches so long as there is a minimal cost.  ____  12:46 p.m.  President Donald Trump is calling the tax bill released Thursday by Congressional Republicans “a great bill,” expressing optimism that it will be passed into law by the end of the year.  Trump says his administration is “working to give the American people a giant tax cut for Christmas.” Calling tax cuts “a big, beautiful Christmas present.” Says Trump: “It will be the biggest cut in the history of our country. It will also be tax reform, and it will create jobs.”  Trump adds that the Republican proposal, which would slash corporate rates and simplify the personal tax code, has been “met with really a great response.”  ____  12:39 p.m.  The House’s top Democrat and her colleagues from California are using the GOP’s tax cut plan to criticize the 14 Republicans from the state who serve in Congress.  The GOP plan released Thursday limits the deductibility of local property taxes to $10,000, while eliminating the deduction for state income taxes.  Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi says millions of Californians rely on the tax deduction, and limiting it will undermine the financial stability of middle-class families in California.  One by one, Democratic members cited a Republican lawmaker from the state and how many people in their district use the deduction at a Capitol Hill news conference.  Pelosi says “every single California Republican voted for a budget resolution that made it possible for this harm to come to our state, and we want their constituents to know about it.”  ____  12:30 p.m.  The top lobby for small businesses says it opposes the newly-released GOP tax plan — at least in its current form. That’s a big blow to Republicans hoping to quickly pass the measure into law.  The National Federation of Independent Business, a powerful GOP-leaning trade association, says the bill “leaves too many small businesses behind.”  It says too many small businesses currently taxed at individual rates of up to 39.6 percent won’t be able to take advantage of a new 25 percent top tax rate. The GOP measure released on Thursday contains safeguards aimed at making sure the new business tax rate isn’t a huge loophole for high-income wage earners such as lawyers.  The NFIB said that “tax reform should provide substantial relief to all small businesses.”  ____  12:24 p.m.  President Donald Trump has congratulated House Republican leaders for introducing legislation to overhaul the tax code.  But Trump cautions that Thursday’s unveiling marks the beginning of the legislative process and that there is “much work left to do.” The president says special interest groups will distort the facts, lobbyists will try to save their “special deals” and the news media will “unfairly report on our efforts.”  He is pledging a tireless effort by the administration to deliver on his promise to cut taxes for working people.  Trump says tax cuts are the “rocket fuel our economy needs to soar higher than ever before.”  The legislation would slash corporate tax rates and lower taxes for most Americans. It would also limit a cherished deduction for homeowners, among other proposed changes.  ____  11:25 a.m.  House Republicans have released their tax cut plan — and it would slash the corporate tax rate, lowers taxes for most people and limit a cherished deduction for homeowners.  President Donald Trump and the GOP are trying to deliver on the first tax revamp in three decades.  The proposal would add $1.5 trillion to the nation’s debt over the next decade.  Middle-income families would pay less thanks to doubling of the standard deduction and an increase in the child tax credit.  The wealthy would benefit from the repeal of the alternative minimum tax and a phase out of the estate tax.  Some two-income, upper middle class families would pay more after being bumped into a higher tax bracket and losing a valuable deduction on state income taxes.  ___  10:30 a.m.  The House GOP tax plan would require some upper-income taxpayers to pay a higher top rate under a new rate structure.  The result would be to increase the tax burden on those subject to a lower rate under the current system.  Families earning more than $260,000 now have a top rate of 33 percent. They’d get kicked up to the 35 percent bracket. At present, the 35 percent rate starts at $416,700 for married couples.  High-bracket earners, especially in high-tax states, would lose the benefit of deducting state income taxes.  But middle-class earners would benefit. That’s because the bill would nearly double the standard deduction to $24,000 for couples and an increase in the per-child tax credit from $1,000 to $1,600.  And the child credit would be available to households earning up to $230,000, more than double the current income limit. A $300 credit would apply to each parent and non-child dependent.  ___  9:45 a.m.  House Republicans are proposing to place new limits on the tax deduction for mortgage interest in their soon-to-be-released overhaul.  A summary of the plan says it would reduce the cap on the popular deduction to interest on mortgages of $500,000 for newly purchased homes. The current mortgage cap is $1 million.  The idea is sure to generate opposition from the real estate lobby, but it’s being used to help pay for tax cuts elsewhere in the plan.  The plan also limits the deductibility of local property taxes to $10,000 while eliminating the deduction for state income taxes.  The child tax credit would rise from $1,000 to $1,600, though the $4,050 per child exemption would be repealed.  ___  4:30 a.m.  House Republicans are planning major changes to the U.S. tax system while looking to preserve current rules for retirement accounts popular with middle-class Americans and to retain a top income-tax rate for million-dollar earners.  GOP negotiators have worked furiously this week to finalize details of the first major revamp of the tax system in three decades.  Still, they missed a self-imposed Wednesday deadline as leading Republicans batted down rumors that the public rollout could be delayed until next week.

The program is billed as a discussion of how American energy resources, particularly fossil fuels, can help poor countries meet electricity needs and drive down greenhouse gas emissions. Entitled “The Role of Cleaner and More Efficient Fossil Fuels and Nuclear Power in Climate Mitigation,” it will feature speakers from Peabody Energy, a coal company; NuScale Power, a nuclear engineering firm; and Tellurian, a liquefied natural gas exporter.  “As the world seeks to reduce emissions while promoting economic prosperity, fossil fuels will continue to play a central role in the energy mix,” a preview of the Nov. 13 presentation says.  The program is likely to provoke strong reactions at the United Nations conference gathering in Bonn, Germany, beginning on Monday for two weeks of negotiations on ways to keep rising global temperatures from reaching catastrophic levels.

But if the risk of a precipitous plunge is now safely in the rear view, a trudge through confusing terrain remains ahead as Britain pushes on toward Europe’s exits — or Brexit.

But the legislation includes several land mines that could complicate its passage, including limits on the popular mortgage interest deduction and caps on the state and local tax deduction, as well as its overall cost. Several Republicans from the high-tax states of New York and New Jersey said the bill would need to change to gain their support, while powerful trade groups representing the real estate industry and small businesses blasted the bill as ineffective and harmful to Americans.  “Contrary to their assertions, the Republicans are picking winners and losers,” Jerry Howard, the chief executive of the National Association of Homebuilders, said in an interview. “They are picking rich Americans and corporations over small businesses and the middle class.”  Meanwhile, Senate Republicans are working on their own tax bill, and on Thursday, Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, lobbed a grenade into the House plan over its cost.  “As I have made clear from the beginning of this debate, it is my hope that the final legislation — while allowing for current policy assumptions and reasonable dynamic scoring — will not add to the deficit, sets rates that are permanent in nature and closes a minimum of $4 trillion in loopholes and special interest deductions,” Mr. Corker said.  Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said that the House plan had the “full support” of Mr. Trump and predicted that it would be on the president’s desk this year. Anticipating the resistance from industry groups, Mr. Brady said, “We’re going to prove them wrong once and for all.”  Representative Peter Roskam, Republican of Illinois and a member of the Ways and Means Committee, said he was bracing for the lobbyist onslaught but would not be deterred.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “We’ve just finished the opening ceremonies of the lobbyist Olympics. My phone has all kinds of messages and there are all kinds of criticisms,” he said. “The notion of just defending the status quo is insufferable, and we’re not going to do it.”  Slide Show  The bill is estimated to cost $1.5 trillion over a decade, and lawmakers must keep it at that amount if they are to pass it along party lines and avoid a filibuster by Democrats. Lawmakers have been scrambling for days to find revenue to offset tax cuts that will cost trillions of dollars. That has prompted a host of changes on the individual side, including repealing tax breaks for things like medical expenses, moving expenses, student loan interest and adoption, as well as making some business tax breaks temporary.  The benefits for individual taxpayers will be mixed and depend largely on where they fall on the income scale, where they live and the types of tax breaks they tend to claim.  Those making up to $24,000 will pay no income tax. For married taxpayers filing jointly, earnings up to $90,000 would be taxed in the 12 percent bracket; earnings up to $260,000 would fall in the 25 percent bracket; and earnings up to $1 million would be taxed at the 35 percent rate. For unmarried individuals and those filing separately, the bracket thresholds would be half of these amounts, other than the 35 percent bracket, which would be $200,000 for unmarried individuals.  The proposal roughly doubles the standard deduction for middle-class families, expanding it to $24,000 for married couples, from $12,700, and setting it at $12,000 for individuals, from $6,530 today. Republicans also plan to expand the child tax credit to $1,600 from $1,000 and add a $300 credit for each parent and nonchild dependent, such as older family members, though that credit would expire after five years.  But it also tightens rules for claiming the child tax credit, a change that would hit immigrant parents whose children were born in the United States. Filers would need to provide a “work-eligible Social Security number” rather than just a taxpayer identification number in order to claim the credit. The left-leaning Center on Budget Policy and Priorities said the bill would roll back eligibility for about three million children in working families, including about 80 percent of whom were born in the United States.  The bill includes a host of other changes that will affect taxpayers in different ways. For instance, it repeals certain tax credits, including a 15 percent credit for individuals aged 65 or over or who are retired on disability. Right now, those individuals can claim up to $7,500 for a joint return, $5,000 for a single individual, or $3,750 for a married individual filing a joint return.  The House bill would entirely repeal that tax credit. It would also repeal the adoption tax credit, no longer allow deductions for tax preparation and repeal credits for alimony payments. And deductions for moving expenses would no longer be allowed.

Under the Republican plan, existing homeowners can keep the deduction, but future purchases will be capped at $500,000, down from the current $1 million limit.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The National Association of Realtors came out swinging against the bill, suggesting a huge fight awaits over how real estate is treated.  “Eliminating or nullifying the tax incentives for homeownership puts home values and middle-class homeowners at risk, and from a cursory examination this legislation appears to do just that,” said William E. Brown, the president of the association. “We will have additional details upon a more thorough reading of the bill.”  Mr. Howard of the homebuilders group said the bill was a broken promise.  “It puts such severe limitations on homebuyers’ ability to use the mortgage interest deduction that home values will fall,” he said.  Another area of contention is the bill’s treatment of the state and local tax deduction, which is popular among many middle- and upper-middle-class taxpayers in high-cost states like New Jersey, New York and California. The House bill would limit the deduction to just property taxes, rather than state and local income taxes and general sales taxes, and cap the benefit at $10,000.  Several Republican lawmakers said they would oppose the bill in its current form, including Representatives Leonard Lance and Frank A. LoBiondo of New Jersey.  The proposal will double the estate tax exemption to roughly $11 million, from $5.49 million, meaning families can avoid paying taxes on large inheritance. And it eventually repeals the estate tax altogether, phasing it out entirely in six years.  Business groups that include large multinationals praised the bill effusively for lowering corporate rates permanently and sharply, and for overhauling the international tax system.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  For the first time, the United States is proposing to effectively levy a global minimum tax of 10 percent, which would apply to income that high-profit subsidiaries of American companies earn anywhere in the world. The effort is aimed at preventing companies from shifting profits abroad and grabbing back some of the tax revenue on income earned overseas. Those profits are currently not taxed until they are returned to the United States, giving companies an incentive to keep that money offshore since they are taxed at the current corporate tax rate of 35 percent.  The White House has said more than $2.5 trillion in American profits are held offshore.  The bill would force companies to pay a one-time 12 percent tax on liquid assets held overseas, like cash. The tax, which is reduced from the current 35 percent tax rate, would be payable over eight years. For illiquid assets, like equipment or property, the tax rate would be 5 percent.  It would also force American subsidiaries of foreign-owned companies to pay a 20 percent excise tax on any payments sent back to foreign affiliates.  Neil Bradley, the chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, called the bill a “home run” for economic growth and warned other groups against blocking it. “Everyone’s going to look at this and find something they don’t like,” Mr. Bradley said. “So they are going to have to decide? Am I going to help get this done?”  Among those less sanguine about the bill are small businesses, which said the bill does not go far enough to help them reduce their tax burden. Republicans stuck to their promise of lowering the tax rate for “pass through” businesses to 25 percent. But to prevent the rate from becoming a loophole for all sorts of individuals, tax writers have created a formula they say will ensure that business owners will pay a higher individual tax rate on income that they receive as wages. The formula would be applied based on the circumstances of the business.  That provision is not enough to satisfy the National Federation of Independent Business, which said in a statement it is “unable to support the House tax reform plan in its current form.”  Placing even more pressure on lawmakers, the Peter G. Peterson Foundation is planning to spend $6 million on a nationwide ad campaign, including a TV commercial, that warns against a tax plan that adds to the national debt.  The message of the campaign is that overhauling the tax code “should grow the economy, not the debt,” said Michael A.

Scientists are claiming an isolated and tiny population of orangutans on the Indonesian island of Sumatra with frizzier hair and smaller heads are a new species of great ape. It's believed that there are no more than 800 of the primates that researchers named Pongo tapanuliensis, making it the most endangered great ape species. (James Askew/Sumatran Orangutan Conservation Programme via AP)  JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — A remote population of frizzy-haired orangutans on the Indonesian island of Sumatra seems to be a new species of primate, scientists say.  But the purportedly newest member of the family tree of advanced animals that include humans may not be around much longer. Their numbers are so small, and their habitat so fragmented, that they are in danger of going extinct, say the scientists who studied them.  A study published Thursday in the journal Current Biology said there are no more than 800 of the primates, which researchers named Pongo tapanuliensis, making it the most endangered great ape species.  The researchers say the population is highly vulnerable and its habitat is facing further pressure from development.  “If steps are not taken quickly to reduce current and future threats to conserve every last remaining bit of forest we may see the discovery and extinction of a great ape species within our lifetime,” they said.  It’s the first great ape species to be described by scientists in nearly 90 years. Previously, science has recognized six great ape species: Sumatran and Bornean orangutans, eastern and western gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos. Some scientists also classify humans as great apes but others argue for a separate categorization.  The research is based on analysis of the skeleton of an adult male killed in a conflict with villagers, a genetic study indicating the population’s evolutionary split from other orangutans occurred about 3.4 million years ago, and analysis since 2006 of behavioral and habitat differences.  The primates are confined to a range of about 1,100 square kilometers (425 square miles) in the Batang Toru forest in the Tapanuli districts of Northern Sumatra. Historically, the population had low levels of interbreeding with Sumatran orangutans further north but that completely ceased 10,000 to 20,000 years ago, according to the genetic study.  Aside from genetic evidence and the physical differences that include frizzier hair and a smaller head, other unique characteristics include diet, restriction of habitat to upland areas and the male’s long call.  There is no standardized international system for recognition of new species, but to be taken seriously a discovery requires at least publication in a credible peer-reviewed scientific journal.  Primatologist Russell Mittermeier, head of the primate specialist group at the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, called the finding a “remarkable discovery” that puts the onus on the Indonesian government to ensure the species survives.  Mittermeier, who was not one of the 37 authors of the study, said he was “very excited” by the research.  Last year, the IUCN classified Bornean orangutans as critically endangered due to a precipitous population decline caused by destruction of their forest habitat for palm oil and pulp wood plantations. Sumatran orangutans have been classified as critically endangered since 2008.  Matthew Nowak, one of the study’s authors, said the Tapanuli orangutans live in three pockets of forest that are separated by non-protected areas.  “For the species to be viable into the future, those three fragments need to be reconnected via forest corridors,” he said.  Additionally, the authors are recommending that development plans for the region including a hydropower plant be stopped by the government.  “It is imperative that all remaining forest be protected and that a local management body works to ensure the protection of the Batang Toru ecosystem,” Novak said.  Wiratno, the director general of conservation of natural resources and ecosystems at Indonesia’s Forestry and Environment Ministry, told a news conference in Jakarta that most of Batang Toru forest was designated as protected in December 2015.  He said its management will be a priority and is a “great challenge.”  “We are deeply committed to maintaining the survival of this species,” said Wiratno, who uses one name.  The Batang Toru orangutan population was found during a field survey by researcher Erik Meijaard in 1997 and a research station was established in the area in 2006.  It was not until 2013, when the adult male skeleton became available, that scientists realized how unique the population was, which sparked the largest genomic study of wild orangutans ever carried out to provide further evidence of a third orangutan species.  ___  Wright reported from Bangkok.",4.125,12,"[5.0, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 4.0, 4.5, 4.5, 3.0, 4.0, 4.5]"
1372,2975,11,2,2017,2017-11-02,The New York Times,Trump Announces Jerome Powell as New Fed Chairman,"As a member of the Fed’s board of governors, Mr. Powell raised concerns in 2013 that the Fed was trying too hard to revive economic growth with its massive bond-buying program — calling into question whether he would be as willing as Mr. Bernanke and Ms. Yellen to use such tools again.  The Fed announced in September 2012 that it would launch a third round of bond buying, purchasing $85 billion a month in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities until economic conditions improved to its satisfaction. The program was backed by Mr. Bernanke, then Fed chair, and Ms. Yellen, then the vice chairwoman, who argued the Fed had not done enough to reduce unemployment.  A group of three Fed governors, including Mr. Powell, pressed Mr. Bernanke to clarify the Fed’s goals, establishing what Mr. Powell called an “off-ramp” for the program.  Mr. Trump will have the opportunity to reshape the Fed further through appointments in the coming months, which could help consolidate or complicate Mr. Powell’s task of forging consensus. The president has three more open seats on the board of governors, and may have a fourth if Ms. Yellen decides to step down from her position on the board as she departs as chair. One addition may be John Taylor, a Stanford economist who is among the Fed’s most vocal critics, and who was a top choice for Fed chief along with Mr. Powell.  Mr. Powell may diverge from his predecessor on financial regulation. In a June appearance before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Powell said that the Fed’s current rules showed opportunities for improvement, although he made clear that he did not fully embrace the Trump administration’s plans for significant reductions in regulation, released a few weeks earlier.  “There are some ideas in the report that make sense, maybe not as expressed there, but it would enable us to reduce the cost of regulation without affecting safety and soundness,” he said, adding, “There are some ideas that I would not support.”  Mr. Powell has expressed support for legislation that would require financial regulators to apply cost-benefit analysis to proposed rules.

(Nils Ribi Photography via AP)  BOISE, Idaho (AP) — The stars are aligning for Idaho — mainly because they’re visible.  The International Dark-Sky Association this week named the central Idaho city of Ketchum an International Dark Sky Community, only the 16th in the world, after years of efforts to limit excess artificial light. It comes as bigger parts of the state received or are seeking rare dark-sky designations that can attract stargazers and boost home values.  Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve in south-central Idaho, a prime destination for astronomy buffs, became an International Dark Sky Park earlier this year, one of about 40 in the United States.  And the rarest prize of all could come in December when the association decides whether to designate 1,400 square miles (3,600 square kilometers) in central Idaho an International Dark Sky Reserve. It would be the first in the nation.  Idaho is “becoming one of the centers of interest in dark skies in the country,” said John Barentine, program manager at the Tucson, Arizona-based International Dark-Sky Association.  Much of Ketchum’s economy runs on tourism, and the designations could bring in additional visitors. Thousands descended on the mountain resort town for last summer’s total solar eclipse, and it’s sandwiched between the ritzy Sun Valley to the east and Sun Valley Resort’s ski area on Bald Mountain to the west, which draws tourists from across the globe.  The town’s designation is due to the “work of so many who have devoted time and energy to reducing light pollution across our city and neighborhoods so that we can enjoy the truly amazing views we have of the night sky,” Mayor Nina Jones said in a statement.  Ketchum, with some of the highest home prices in Idaho, is the first city in the state to be named a Dark Sky Community. The association started making such designations in 2001, which also include Sedona, Arizona; Beverly Shores, Indiana; and Moffat, Scotland.  Dark-sky measures have drawn opposition in the U.S. from the outdoor advertising industry and those against additional government regulations.  The Ketchum designation could help as the International Dark-Sky Association considers a 127-page application for the reserve in Idaho. Barentine said the group looks at what surrounding communities are doing to protect the dark core area of the reserve.  “It’s more like a restoration effort in the communities, and it’s more of a preservation effort in the parks and reserves,” he said.  Barentine said Craters of the Moon monument is too far away from the proposed reserve to be a factor in the decision, expected in mid-December.",4.045454545454546,11,"[4.5, 3.0, 5.0, 3.5, 4.0, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 5.0, 4.0]"

(Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP, File)  LOS ANGELES (AP) — Authorities in Los Angeles and New York said Thursday they had opened new investigations into Harvey Weinstein, the latest in a series of criminal probes into conduct by the disgraced film mogul which has sparked a sexual harassment scandal roiling Hollywood and other industries.  The Manhattan district attorney’s office said a senior prosecutor has been assigned to investigate allegations by “Boardwalk Empire” actress Paz de la Huerta, who told CBS News that Weinstein raped her twice in her apartment in 2010. Spokeswoman Joan Vollero said New York police were also involved, but further details could not be provided.  De la Huerta spoke to CBS News by phone and said the first rape occurred in October 2010 after Weinstein gave her a ride home from a party, insisted on having a drink in her apartment and forced himself on her. She said the second rape occurred in December 2010 after Weinstein came to her apartment; she had been drinking and was not in a condition to give consent, CBS reported the actress said.  Los Angeles police are investigating allegations about Weinstein that occurred in 2015, but spokesman Josh Rubenstein said he could not provide any additional details. The department is also investigating a report by an Italian actress and model who said she was raped by Weinstein in 2013.  Charlotte Triggs, senior editor for People Magazine, discusses the sexual harassment, abuse and assault allegations leveled against some of Hollywood's biggest stars. (Nov. 2)  Weinstein representative Sallie Hofmeister reiterated a statement that Weinstein, 65, denies all allegations of non-consensual sex.  Authorities in Beverly Hills and London are also investigating Weinstein for possible criminal cases.  The investigations came four weeks after The New York Times published an expose of sexual harassment allegations against Weinstein, leading to his firing from the company he co-founded and his expulsion from the producers guild and the organization that bestows the Academy Awards.  The accusations against Weinstein have prompted numerous allegations of sexual harassment and abuse against powerful men in Hollywood and other industries.  CNN reported on Thursday that eight current or former “House of Cards” workers claim that Kevin Spacey made the production a “toxic” workplace and one ex-employee alleges the actor sexually assaulted him.  The workers’ identities were withheld from Thursday’s report because they fear professional fallout, the cable news channel said.  Among them is a former production assistant who alleged that Spacey assaulted him during one of the Netflix show’s early seasons, and CNN reported that all of the people described Spacey’s behavior as predatory.  The report accuses Spacey of allegedly targeting staffers who were typically young and male with nonconsensual touching and crude comments.  Netflix has suspended production on the series, which was slated to end after its sixth season. The streaming service and “House of Cards” producers said Thursday that one allegation against Spacey involved a remark and gesture made during production of the show’s first season in 2012. After, Spacey willingly participated in training and producer Media Rights Capital said it was not aware of any additional complaints against the actor since then.  The production company said it has instituted a hotline for complaints and will investigate them thoroughly. There was no word on the fate of “House of Cards” in Thursday’s statements.  A person with knowledge of the decision said late Thursday that Spacey’s publicist and talent agency CAA have parted ways with the actor. His representatives on Wednesday said the two-time Oscar winner was in treatment for an unspecified condition.  Also on Thursday, actor Corey Feldman appeared on “The Dr. Oz Show” and named the man who he said molested him when he was a young teen.  Feldman made his comments in an interview with series host Mehmet Oz and in an on-air call that Oz identified as being to the Los Angeles Police Department.  Los Angeles Police Department Officer Drake Madison says the department is aware of the show, but no report has yet been filed.  The Associated Press is withholding his name because the man could not be located to comment on Feldman’s allegations.  Feldman, 46, gained fame in the 1980s with films including “Gremlins,” ″The Goonies” and “Stand by Me.”  While the outcome of criminal investigations into allegations against Weinstein remains unclear, the producer may have to give sworn testimony in a lawsuit he filed against his former company.  Attorneys for The Weinstein Co. told a Delaware judge on Thursday that they want to take sworn testimony from the producer, who is suing to gain access to his personnel file and emails.  Weinstein’s seeking the records to defend himself in potential civil and criminal cases, and to help the company respond to a civil rights investigation by New York’s attorney general.  The judge said Weinstein could be deposed, even though his attorney said a deposition would be “tricky” and “fraught with problems,” given the ongoing criminal investigations. The attorney said Weinstein’s ability to testify would be limited without waiving his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination.  ___  AP Television Writer Lynn Elber and Entertainment Writer Anthony McCartney in Los Angeles, AP writer Randall Chase in Dover, Delaware, contributed to this report.",3.3181818181818183,88,"[0.5, 5.0, 3.0, 0.5, 3.5, 2.5, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.0, 1.0, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 2.5, 1.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.0, 5.0, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 2.0, 2.5, 1.5, 4.5, 4.5, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0, 2.5, 4.0, 0.5, 5.0, 5.0, 1.5, 3.5, 4.5, 2.5, 4.0, 4.0, 2.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.0, 0.5, 3.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 1.5, 4.5, 4.5, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 2.5, 1.5, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 2.0, 3.5, 4.0, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 4.0, 3.5, 0.5, 3.0, 4.0, 1.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.5, 3.5, 1.5]"

Kristi Noem, R-S.D., during a news conference announcing GOP tax legislation, Thursday, Nov. 2, 2017, on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)  WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans have stressed that the tax plan they unveiled Thursday is tailored to benefit America’s middle class. Just how much it would remains uncertain based on the details that have been provided so far.  What is clear is that many of the benefits for the middle class could dwindle over time, even while companies and wealthy individuals could enjoy lasting tax advantages.  The plan promises tax savings next year of $1,182 for a typical household of four with gross income of $59,000, leaving their tax bill at $400.  “We are focused on increasing paychecks in a major way,” said Rep. Kevin Brady, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.  But the proposal’s conflicting provisions and phase-outs of certain benefits suggest that taxes could rise for some middle class earners over time. And for many, the income gains being touted by President Donald Trump are unlikely to materialize.  Some of these complications arise because under the budget instructions, the planned tax cuts can’t increase the national debt by more than $1.5 trillion over the next decade. Anything above $1.5 trillion would force Republicans to amend their plan to generate more revenue — a change that would likely prove difficult.  Trump has frequently said that this would be the biggest tax cut in U.S. history. But outside analyses show that that’s not the case.  The tax plan’s primary beneficiaries would be wealthier Americans, who would enjoy lower tax rates despite the elimination of some breaks, a repeal of the so-called alternative minimum tax and the termination of the estate tax.  “With the details they’ve presented to us so far, it looks like the tax cut benefits the wealthy and major corporations,” said Martin Sullivan, chief economist at Tax Analysts and a former staff economist at the Treasury Department. “In fact, if you have a large family, given the facts that we have now, that you would pay more in taxes.”  Here’s why:  A married couple making less than $90,000 would be taxed at a 12 percent rate, instead of the current 15 percent. The size of their standard deduction would nearly double to $24,000.  But that same couple would lose personal exemptions — deductions that largely benefit families with multiple children. The child tax credit would rise to $1,600 from $1,000 — short of the $2,000 that Sullivan said would be needed to make many families whole.  The tax plan would also repeal the deduction of substantial medical costs, including what families might spend on nursing home care. Nor could people with student loans deduct the interest paid on the debt anymore.  And the plan would cap the deduction of state and local taxes. It also would use a less generous measure of inflation, so that more middle class taxpayers would creep into a higher bracket over several years.  All told, nearly 70 percent of the tax cuts would go to businesses over 10 years, according to an analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The rest of the tax cuts appear to favor the wealthy.  Gary Cohn, the president’s top economic adviser, said Thursday at the Economic Club of Washington that the objective was to help the middle class. But he declined to say whether the wealthy would benefit.  “The hard part about taxes is everyone has got their own unique set of circumstances,” Cohn said.  The plan is already showing some splintering along ideological lines.  The conservative Tax Foundation’s analysis of how different families would fare under the plan suggested that the largest cuts as a percentage of taxes paid would go next year to sample couples earning between $48,000 and $85,000. Even a married couple with two children earning $165,000 would receive a reduction.  But liberal groups stressed the analysis of nonpartisan groups that the benefits would flow largely flow to major companies and the top 1 percent of earners over time as tax breaks such as a new family credit would expire after five years.  “Tax cuts for the well-off are forever,” said Gene Sperling, a former top economic aide in the Obama and Clinton presidencies. “Tax cuts for the middle class are a small, a maybe and some-time thing that can be cut off in their plan.”  The overarching promise made to the middle class by Trump and congressional Republicans is that lower taxes would fuel faster economic growth, which, in turn, would cause incomes to rise. Kevin Hassett, chair of Trump’s White House Council of Economic Advisers, estimates that lowering the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent would lead to an average income gain of $4,000 a year.  But most mainstream economists have disputed that claim. Kent Smetters, faculty director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, estimates that the income growth after a decade would range between $500 to $1,500.  Some tax experts say the tax overhaul might also hurt those who aspire to be middle class. The bottom half of taxpayers now pay no net income tax, according to Treasury Department figures. Many receive refunds via the Earned Income Tax Credit. The plan unveiled Thursday would require eligible taxpayers to provide their Social Security Number to receive this benefit, thereby creating a possible delay in receiving a refund as the IRS enforces this provision.  David Kamin, a former Obama White House official who now teaches law at New York University, said the plan seems to have “no significant help of any kind for about the bottom 35 percent of income earners.”  He added that the proposal could also “run up deficits significantly that would eventually have to be paid for and could threaten programs that do help low and middle income Americans whether that be health care coverage, Social Security, or investments like in infrastructure.”",3.33,100,"[4.5, 1.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.5, 5.0, 3.5, 3.5, 5.0, 1.5, 2.5, 4.5, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 1.0, 4.0, 1.5, 5.0, 5.0, 3.5, 3.0, 5.0, 0.5, 5.0, 4.0, 1.5, 4.5, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5, 4.0, 0.5, 2.0, 0.5, 3.0, 4.5, 4.5, 5.0, 1.0, 4.5, 3.5, 1.5, 5.0, 1.0, 4.5, 3.0, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 0.5, 4.0, 1.5, 2.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 5.0, 2.5, 4.5, 5.0, 2.5, 4.0, 3.5, 4.5, 5.0, 0.5, 3.5, 0.5, 2.5, 3.0, 4.5, 2.0, 4.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 5.0, 4.5, 5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 4.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 0.5, 2.0, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5, 1.5, 4.5, 1.5, 0.5, 3.5, 5.0]"
1340,2939,11,2,2017,2017-11-02,Associated Press News,EPA to hold hearing on climate plan repeal in West Virginia," The Trump administration announced Thursday it will hold a public hearing in West Virginia on its plan to nullify an Obama-era plan to limit planet-warming carbon emissions. The state is economically dependent on coal mining.  The Environmental Protection Agency will take comments on its proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan in Charleston, the state capital, on Nov. 28 and 29.  “The EPA is headed to the heart of coal country to hear from those most impacted by the CPP and get their comments on the proposed repeal rule,” said EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. “The agency looks forward to hearing from all interested stakeholders.”  No other public hearings have yet been scheduled. EPA will also accept written comments about the proposed repeal through mid-January.  “We encourage stakeholders to participate, and submit comments online — including any requests for additional public meetings,” said Liz Bowman, an EPA spokeswoman. “As this is a vital issue that affects people across the country, we will do our best to respond to requests for additional meetings.”  Under the Obama administration, EPA held four multiday public hearings — in Washington, Atlanta, Pittsburgh and Denver — to collect feedback before issuing the Clean Power Plan in 2015. About two dozen conservative-leaning states and a battery of fossil-fuel companies immediately sued, successfully preventing the carbon reduction plan from taking effect prior to the election of Donald Trump, who as a candidate pledged to repeal it.  A Republican lawyer who previously served as the attorney general of Oklahoma, Pruitt was among those who fought the Clean Power Plan in court. Since his appointment by Trump to lead EPA, he has made the delay and reversal of recent environmental regulations negatively impacting the profits of coal and petrochemical companies a priority.  Though Trump, Pruitt and others have blamed environmental regulations for the loss of coal-mining jobs, many industry insiders concede that it has been the accelerating shift of electric utilities using cheaper and cleaner-burning natural gas that is the primary culprit.  Pruitt has also sought to cast doubt on the consensus of climate scientists that the continued burning of fossil fuels is the main driver of global warming. Scientists say climate change has already triggered rising seas and more extreme weather, including killer heat waves, worsened droughts and torrential rains.  A Government Accountability Office report released earlier this month concluded that the impacts from climate change are already costing the federal government money, and those costs will likely increase over time.  U.S. taxpayers spent more than $350 billion over the last decade on disaster assistance programs and insurance payouts from floods and crop failures. That tally does not include the massive toll from this year’s wildfires and three major hurricanes, expected to be among the most costly in the nation’s history.  The report predicts these costs will only grow in the future, averaging a budget busting $35 billion each year by 2050 — a figure that recent history would suggest is a conservative estimate.  Bill Price, an organizer for the Sierra Club based in West Virginia, worried that by holding the public hearing where support for both Trump and coal are the strongest, the administration hoped that those opposed to that agenda might be more reticent to speak out.  “There is a concern that the scheduled hearing in West Virginia has all the markings of a sham, that only gives a dying industry a venue to intimidate people,” Price said. “It is our hope that the hearing will provide a safe place where all viewpoints can be heard.”  ___  Register to comment on the EPA’s proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan:  https://www.epa.gov/stationary-sources-air-pollution/electric-utility-generating-units-repealing-clean-power-plan  ___  Follow Associated Press environmental writer Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck",3.2358490566037736,53,"[4.0, 1.5, 4.5, 2.0, 3.0, 3.5, 2.5, 3.0, 3.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0, 1.5, 3.5, 3.0, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 0.5, 5.0, 0.5, 4.0, 4.0, 2.5, 4.5, 2.5, 5.0, 1.5, 4.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 4.5, 3.0, 4.0, 2.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.0, 4.5, 3.5, 4.0, 2.5, 2.0, 1.5, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.0, 4.0]"

Kevin Brady, R-Texas, right. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)  WASHINGTON (AP) — With fanfare and a White House kickoff, House Republicans unfurled a broad tax-overhaul plan Thursday that would touch virtually all Americans and the economy’s every corner, mingling sharply lower rates for corporations and reduced personal taxes for many with fewer deductions for home-buyers and families with steep medical bills.  The measure, which would be the most extensive rewrite of the nation’s tax code in three decades, is the product of a party that faces increasing pressure to produce a marquee legislative victory of some sort before next year’s elections. GOP leaders touted the plan as a sparkplug for the economy and a boon to the middle class and christened it the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  “We are working to give the American people a giant tax cut for Christmas,” President Donald Trump said in the Oval Office. The measure, he said, “will also be tax reform, and it will create jobs.”  It would also increase the national debt, a problem for some Republicans. And Democrats attacked the proposal as the GOP’s latest bonanza for the rich, with a phase-out of the inheritance tax and repeal of the alternative minimum tax on the highest earners — certain to help Trump and members of his family and Cabinet, among others.  House Republicans unveiled a sweeping tax reform bill on Wednesday that promises to cut taxes and simplify the tax code, but also cuts some popular deductions and credits. (Nov. 2)  “If you’re the wealthiest 1 percent, Republicans will give you the sun, the moon and the stars, all of that at the expense of the great middle class,” said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.  And there was enough discontent among Republicans and business groups to leave the legislation’s fate uncertain in a journey through Congress that leaders hope will deposit a landmark bill on Trump’s desk by year’s end.  Underscoring problems ahead, some Republicans from high-tax Northeastern states expressed opposition to the measure’s elimination of the deduction for state and local income taxes. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah called the House measure “a great starting point” but said it would be “somewhat miraculous” if its corporate tax rate reduction to 20 percent — a major Trump goal — survived. His panel plans to produce its own tax package in the coming days.  The House Republicans’ plan, which took them months to craft in countless closed-door meetings, represents the first step in their effort to reverse what’s been a politically disastrous year in Congress. Their drive to obliterate President Barack Obama’s health care law crashed, and GOP lawmakers concede that if the tax measure collapses, their congressional majorities are at risk in next November’s elections.  The package’s tax reductions would outweigh its loophole closers by a massive $1.5 trillion over the coming decade. Many Republicans were willing to add that to the nation’s soaring debt as a price for claiming a resounding tax victory. But it was likely to pose a problem for others — one of several brushfires leaders will need to extinguish to get the measure through Congress.  Republicans must keep their plan’s shortfall from spilling over that $1.5 trillion line or the measure will lose its protection against Democratic Senate filibusters, bill-killing delays that take 60 votes to overcome. There are just 52 GOP senators and unanimous Democratic opposition is likely.  The bill would telescope today’s seven personal income tax brackets into just four: 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent and 39.6 percent.  — The 25 percent rate would start at $45,000 for individuals and $90,000 for married couples.  — The 35 percent rate would apply to family income exceeding $260,000 and individual income over $200,000, which means many upper-income families whose top rate is currently 33 percent would face higher taxes.  — The top rate threshold, now $418,400 for individuals and $470,700 for couples, would rise to $500,000 and $1 million.  The standard deduction — used by people who don’t itemize, around two-thirds of taxpayers — would nearly double to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for couples. That’s expected to encourage even more people to use the standard deduction with a simplified tax form Republicans say will be postcard-sized.  Many middle-income families would pay less, thanks to the bigger standard deduction and an increased child tax credit. Republicans said their plan would save $1,182 in taxes for a family of four earning $59,000, but features like phase-outs of some benefits suggest their taxes could grow in the future.  “The plan clearly chooses corporate CEOs and hedge fund managers over teachers and police officers,” said Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-N.J.  One trade-off for the plan’s reductions was its elimination of breaks that millions have long treasured. Gone would be deductions for people’s medical expenses — especially important for families facing nursing home bills or lacking insurance — and their ability to write off state and local income taxes. The mortgage interest deduction would be limited to the first $500,000 of the loan, down from the current $1 million ceiling.  Led by Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the authors retained the deductibility of up to $10,000 in local property taxes in a bid to line up votes from Republicans from the Northeast. The panel planned to begin votes on the proposal next Monday.  “It’s progress, but I want more,” said Rep. Leonard Lance, R-N.J., who represents one of his state’s wealthier, higher-cost districts and wants the entire property tax deduction restored.  On the business side, the House would drop the top rate for corporations from 35 percent to 20 percent. American companies operating abroad would pay a 10 percent tax on their overseas subsidiaries’ profits. Cash that those firms have amassed abroad but now return home would face a one-time 12 percent tax.  Also reduced to 25 percent would be the rate for many “pass-through” businesses, whose profits are taxed at the owners’ individual rate.  But some of those companies would face higher rates. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said that disparity was “just not acceptable,” and the National Federation of Independent Business said it opposed the bill because it “does not help most small businesses.”  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce praised the measure but said “a lot of work remains to be done.” The group’s chief policy officer, Neil Bradley, said pass-throughs were one concern.  ___  AP reporters Andrew Taylor, Zeke Miller and Kevin Freking in Washington and Mike Catalini in Trenton, New Jersey, contributed.  ___  This story has been corrected to say 52 GOP senators, not 50.",3.5384615384615383,52,"[3.0, 2.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 3.0, 4.0, 0.5, 4.0, 5.0, 2.5, 4.5, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5, 1.5, 5.0, 4.5, 3.5, 4.0, 3.0, 4.5, 0.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.5, 4.5, 0.5, 5.0, 3.0, 0.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.0, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 5.0, 2.5, 5.0, 4.0, 2.5, 4.5, 3.5, 2.0, 4.5, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0]"

Sarah Wasko / Media Matters    Maine voters will have an opportunity to vote to expand Medicaid  AP: On Election Day, Maine voters will decide whether to expand Medicaid in their state via a ballot initiative. Voters in Maine will decide on this Election Day “whether to join 31 other states and expand Medicaid under former President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act,” The Associated Press (AP) reported. As AP noted, “It is the first time since the law took effect nearly four years ago that the expansion question has been put to voters.” From the October 31 article:  On Nov. 7, voters in Maine will decide whether to join 31 other states and expand Medicaid under former President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. It is the first time since the law took effect nearly four years ago that the expansion question has been put to voters. The ballot measure comes after Maine’s Republican governor vetoed five attempts by the politically divided Legislature to expand the program and take advantage of the federal government picking up most of the cost. [The Associated Press, 10/31/17]  Local TV in Maine omitted information about the key benefits of expansion from their reports  Media Matters analyzed eight months of local news reporting on the ballot initiative to expand Medicaid. A Media Matters analysis found that, in total, local TV news networks in Portland, ME, covered the initiative in 49 segments between February 21, when the initiative was approved, and October 21. Those segments routinely omitted important information about the benefits of expanding Medicaid in Maine:  CBPP: Expanding Medicaid “would provide Medicaid coverage to more than 70,000 low-income Mainers.” The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) estimated that expanding Medicaid in Maine “would provide Medicaid coverage to more than 70,000 low-income Mainers.” [Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 10/25/17]  Only about 30 percent of local news segments in Portland, ME, mentioned potential coverage gains under Medicaid expansion. A Media Matters analysis of local TV coverage of the Medicaid expansion initiative in Portland, ME, found that of 49 segments that discussed the policy over the course of eight months, only 15 segments -- or 30.6 percent -- mentioned the potential coverage gains for citizens if Maine expanded Medicaid.  CBPP: In states that expanded Medicaid, “nearly 1.7 million rural Americans have gained coverage through the Medicaid expansion.” “Nearly 1.7 million rural Americans have gained coverage through the Medicaid expansion,” according to CBPP. The center also explained that in states that expanded Medicaid, “rural residents make up a larger share of expansion enrollees than of the states’ combined populations.” [Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 6/23/17]  No segments discussed potential coverage gains by rural Mainers. Of the 49 segments, none mentioned potential coverage gains for those who live in rural parts of Maine.  Council of Economic Advisers: Residents in states that expanded Medicaid are more likely to say they are in good or excellent health than residents in other states. A 2014 analysis by then-President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers found that “having insurance coverage improves overall health.” By expanding Medicaid in the 24 states that had not yet done so at that point, the report estimated, “757,000 additional people would report being in excellent, very good, or good health.” The report also found that “states that have already expanded Medicaid will achieve this outcome for 575,000 people.” [The Council of Economic Advisers, 7/2/14]  Only one segment mentioned the overall health benefits of expanding Medicaid. Of the 49 total segments, only one -- or 2.0 percent -- mentioned the potential health benefits that correlate with expanding Medicaid.  CBPP: Expanding Medicaid has “substantially improved rural hospitals’ finances.” CBPP found that expanding Medicaid has “substantially improved rural hospitals’ finances,” partially because “the Medicaid expansion significantly reduced rural hospitals’ uncompensated care costs.” Additionally, CBPP stated that expanding Medicaid has “improved all hospitals’ operating margins” and “excess margins … but the effect was particularly pronounced in rural areas.” From the CBPP report (citations removed):  Health coverage gains in states that expanded Medicaid to low-income adults have substantially improved rural hospitals’ finances. First, the Medicaid expansion significantly reduced rural hospitals’ uncompensated care costs — services for which hospitals are not reimbursed by an insurer or the patient. Between 2013 and 2015, rural hospitals’ uncompensated care costs fell 43 percent in Medicaid expansion states, compared to 16 percent in non-expansion states. Uncompensated care costs among rural hospitals declined as a share of total costs from 5.3 percent to 3.2 percent in expansion states, while only declining from 6.8 percent to 6.1 percent in non-expansion states. Uncompensated care costs have been shown to strain hospital budgets, reduce profit margins, and contribute to hospital closings. The Medicaid expansion also significantly increased Medicaid revenue among rural hospitals. Since 2013, Medicaid revenue as a share of total hospital revenue rose by 33 percent in rural hospitals in expansion states, compared to just 1.1 percent among rural hospitals in non-expansion states. That 33 percent increase equates to $2 million in higher annual revenue to the average rural hospital due to the Medicaid expansion. The Medicaid expansion improved all hospitals’ operating margins (i.e., the difference between their revenue from providing services to patients and their total operating expenses) and excess margins (the difference between revenue from all sources, including donations, parking fees, vending machines, etc., and total operating expenses), but the effect was particularly pronounced in rural areas. Rural hospitals in expansion states increased their operating margins by 4.0 percentage points more, and their excess margins by 2.3 percentage points more, than rural hospitals in non-expansion states. Gains were particularly pronounced among small rural hospitals with fewer than 100 beds in expansion states, where operating margins rose by 4.5 percent. The Medicaid expansion led to smaller gains in operating and excess margins in urban areas, of 1.0 percentage points and 0.9 percentage points, respectively. [Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 6/23/17]  Only three segments mentioned the potential financial benefits for rural hospitals. Of the 49 total segments, only three -- or 6.1 percent -- mentioned the financial benefits for rural hospitals in states that expanded Medicaid.  Families USA: Expanding Medicaid leads to “higher educational attainment” for children. In a blog post, Families USA summarized a report finding that expanding Medicaid allows children “to reap the benefits associated with health coverage,” which go beyond health care and include “higher educational attainment and greater economic opportunities for children, and the creation of a more skilled workforce.” From the July 8, 2014, blog post:  The expansion of Medicaid gives parents options for affordable health coverage. When more parents enroll in health insurance, so do their kids, allowing them to reap the benefits associated with health coverage. These benefits extend beyond access to health care, as the Cornell and Harvard researchers note in their study: “[T]he long-run returns to providing health insurance access to children are larger than just the…gains in health status.” Those returns include higher educational attainment and greater economic opportunities for children, and the creation of a more skilled workforce. With these findings, it should be clear to policymakers that not only does expanding Medicaid close the coverage gap – it also increases the payback on their education investment. [Families USA, 7/8/14]  No segments mentioned the educational benefits for children of expanding Medicaid. Of the 49 total segments, none mentioned the educational benefits for children in states that expanded Medicaid.  Robert Woods Johnson Foundation: States that expanded Medicaid “report financial benefits through savings and revenue gains.” “As a result of Medicaid expansion, states continue to report financial benefits through savings and revenue gains,” a study by the Robert Woods Johnson Foundation found. As the report explained, the saving and revenue “can be used to finance other state spending priorities or to offset much, if not all, of the state costs of expansion.” [Robert Woods Johnson Foundation, March 2016]  Only three segments discussed the budgetary benefits for states that expanded Medicaid. Of the 49 total segments, only three -- or 6.1 percent -- mentioned budgetary benefits states received after expanding Medicaid.  KFF: “Research suggests that Medicaid expansion improves the affordability of care and financial security among the low-income population.” The Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) summarized research that “suggests that Medicaid expansion improves the affordability of care and financial security among the low-income population.” Among the studies, KFF noted, several found “expansion states have experienced greater reductions in unmet medical need because of cost than non-expansion states.” Additionally, “multiple studies found larger declines in trouble paying medical bills in expansion states relative to non-expansion states.” [Kaiser Family Foundation, 6/20/16]  No segments mentioned increased financial security for low-income people in states that expanded Medicaid. Of the 49 total segments, none mentioned the increased affordability of care and financial security low-income people found in states that expanded Medicaid.  NY Times: Expanding Medicaid “could lower insurance prices for everyone else.” The New York Times’ Margot Sanger-Katz summarized a study by the Department of Health and Human Services which found “insurance in the marketplace for middle-income people cost less in the places that had expanded Medicaid” in 2015. From the August 25, 2016, article:  The Obama administration for years has been pleading with states to expand their Medicaid programs and offer health coverage to low-income people. Now it has a further argument in its favor: Expansion of Medicaid could lower insurance prices for everyone else. A new study published by in-house researchers at the Department of Health and Human Services compared places that have expanded their Medicaid programs as part of Obamacare with neighboring places that have not. They found that, in 2015, insurance in the marketplace for middle-income people cost less in the places that had expanded Medicaid. By comparing counties across state borders, and adjusting for several differences between them, the researchers calculated that expanding Medicaid meant marketplace premiums that were 7 percent lower. [The New York Times, 8/25/16]  No segments mentioned the correlation between Medicaid expansion and lower premiums. Of the 49 total segments, none mentioned the correlation between states that expanded Medicaid and states that had lower premiums.  State Health Reform Assistance Network: States that expanded Medicaid have the “greatest opportunity” to address opioid addiction. “Medicaid is the most powerful vehicle available to states to fund coverage of prevention and treatment for their residents at risk for or actively battling opioid addiction,” according to a report by the State Health Reform Assistance Network, a project of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. From the July 2016 report:  States are grappling day to day with the vast and deadly public health crisis. Medicaid is the most powerful vehicle available to states to fund coverage of prevention and treatment for their residents at risk for or actively battling opioid addiction. Through federal flexibility, states can create strategies that meet their specific needs, designed to augment other efforts underway. The greatest opportunity to address this crisis is in those states that have elected to expand Medicaid, given the greater reach of the program, additional tools available, and the increased availability of federal funds. [State Health Reform Assistance Network, July 2016]  No segments mentioned the impact expanding Medicaid has on opioid addiction. Of the 49 total segments, none mentioned the impact Medicaid expansion has on addiction treatment for opioid use.  GAO: Medicaid expansion enrollees in three states “could more easily access treatment” for mental or behavioral health issues than when uninsured. A report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that in Iowa, Washington, and West Virginia, “compared to being uninsured, expansion enrollees could more easily access treatment, such as community-based mental health services and behavioral health prescription drugs.” [United States Government Accountability Office, June 2017]  No segments mentioned the impact of expanding Medicaid on mental and behavioral health treatment. Of the 49 total segments, none mentioned the impact of Medicaid expansion on mental health treatment.  Sinclair stations were less likely to cover the Medicaid expansion ballot initiative than other networks    Sarah Wasko / Media Matters    Sinclair-owned networks aired only eight segments about the potential Medicaid expansion over the course of eight months. Over the eight-month study period, the two Sinclair-owned stations in Portland, ME, CBS affiliate WGME and Fox Broadcasting Co. affiliate WPFO, aired merely eight segments discussing the initiative to expand Medicaid in Maine. In contrast, the two stations not owned by Sinclair, ABC affiliate WMTW and NBC affiliate WCSH, aired 30 segments and 11 segments on the topic, respectively. [Portland Press Herald, 7/30/17]  Methodology  Media Matters searched iQ media for mentions of “Medicaid” and all iterations of the word “expand” on the ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox Broadcasting Co. affiliates in Portland, ME.

For most of America, the impact would be minimal. The proposed bill would make the interest deduction available on mortgage debt of up to $500,000 — half the current ceiling. But that is still more than double the median home price in the United States of roughly $200,000. Fewer than 3 percent of home mortgages are more than $500,000, according to data from CoreLogic.  But if the idea holds — and history suggests that will be difficult — it will echo loudly through higher-priced cities on the coasts. “The impact on the market is going to be recognizable,” said Ure R.

1325,2924,11,2,2017,2017-11-02,Vox,"How cosmic rays revealed a new, mysterious void inside the Great Pyramid","Today, the journal Nature has published a finding that sounds like the setup to a Nicolas Cage movie. A team of physicists and engineers has discovered a previously unknown “void” in the Great Pyramid at Giza in Egypt. And they did it with the help of cosmic rays created at the edge of space.  The “ScanPyramids Big Void,” as scientists are calling it, is around 98 feet long and about 50 feet high. The investigators don’t know what’s inside this void or what its purpose is. Nor do they have any way to currently access it.  But it’s a huge finding. “No very big structure has not been discovered inside the Khufu pyramid since the Middle Ages,” Mehdi Tayoubi, co-founder of the nonprofit that led the research, told reporters Wednesday.  The Great Pyramid, also known as Khufu’s pyramid, was built around 2560 BC to ensure the immortality of the Pharaoh Khufu after his death. The pyramid is one of the wonders of the ancient world, and it’s one of three at the site at Giza (along with the Great Sphinx).  Khufu wasn’t just a king — he was thought to be a god. And so his death commanded something spectacular. At 455 feet, his pyramid stood as the world’s tallest man-made building until the year 1300. That’s 3,800 years. The pyramid was about as old to the ancient Romans as the Romans are to us. And throughout the rise and fall of civilizations, the pyramids have remained a fascination. Even today, they still contain mysteries — like the newly identified void.  But archaeologists say that while it’s still hard to say how archaeologically significant the void is, it’s likely an intentional design element.  “When you’re dealing with creating a monument to house the immortal remains of an individual who bridges heaven and Earth, and whose ascendance to the stars helps assure the perpetual prosperity of Egypt, I don’t think [this void] was a cost-cutting measure,” Adam Maskevich, an archaeologist who was not an author on the paper, explains. (The New York Times explains the void could have been an engineering necessity to lessen the weight of the structure.)  And scientists suspect it’s there because of cosmic rays.  How cosmic rays found the void  For two years, the ScanPyramids project, a collaboration between the Heritage Innovation Preservation project in Egypt, Cairo University, and the Egyptian government, has been using advanced techniques from the world of particle physics to learn more about the pyramids.  “Just because a mystery is 4,500 years old doesn’t mean it can’t be solved,” the ScanPyramids project explains.  Subtle techniques from physics are particularly helpful for exploring priceless ancient treasures like pyramids. You can’t knock out walls in the pursuit of a new discovery. So the ScanPyramids team takes a nondestructive approach.  Here’s the simplest way to describe what they did: It’s like they took an X-ray of the structure with cosmic rays.  Recall that when you go for an X-ray, radiation passes through your body. But this radiation gets partially stopped by the denser parts of your body (i.e., bones), while the soft tissue lets most of them pass on through. The X-ray machine is essentially picking up on the shadow of X-rays cast by your bones.  With the pyramid scan, the scientists used not X-rays but cosmic rays. These are sprays of high-energy subatomic particles that shower us every day.  Kyle Cranmer, a particle physicist at New York University, explains how cosmic rays form. It starts with huge energetic events like exploding stars. These events shoot jets of atomic nuclei across the universe at speeds nearing the speed of light. When these high-energy particles reach Earth, they slam into our atmosphere like shotgun pellets and “hit the nuclei of other atoms” in our atmosphere, Cranmer says.  When those atomic nuclei from space hit those atoms in our atmosphere at near the speed of light, they burst open, spilling out the subatomic particles that make up all the matter in the universe: electrons, positrons, neutrinos, muons, and so on. (This is exactly what scientists try to replicate with particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider.)  Some of these particles are very short-lived: They fall apart in a fraction of a second. But muons — which are a heavy version of the electron — are heavy and stable enough to reach the ground.  “They [muons] are going through us right now — thousands going through us every second,” Cranmer says. (You can actually build your own cosmic ray detector at home, and it really doesn’t seem all that hard. Even your smartphone can be turned into a cosmic ray detector.)  Those muons rocket down to Earth at 98 percent the speed of light — so fast they experience the time dilation predicted by Einstein’s theory of special relativity. They’re supposed to decay in just 2 microseconds, which would mean they’d barely get 2,000 feet down from the top of the atmosphere before dying. But because they’re moving so fast, relative to us, they age much more slowly. (A similar thing happens to Matthew McConaughey’s character in Interstellar.)  When they hit objects on the ground, they act exactly like X-rays: Dense objects absorb them; less dense objects let them pass through. The ScanPyramids team used photographic plates sensitive to muons. These photographic plates were placed inside the already-explored chambers of the pyramid and around the outside of the structure. The data from each plate was then combined to make a map of the void.  And the researchers found that the muon pattern observed in these photographic plates looked a lot like the pattern of muons from the pyramid’s grand gallery. That makes them confident that what they are observing is truly an empty space and not just a region of less dense rock.  The team previously had success using these techniques to map the (already known) internal structure of the Bent Pyramid, a smaller pyramid in Egypt. No new voids were found on that investigation.  Okay, so what might be the purpose of this void?  The Great Pyramid is a wonder of the ancient world built around 2400 BC; experts still don’t know exactly how it was constructed. The void is completely sealed off from the known passageways in the pyramid. There’s no way to currently get to it. And so Nature’s finding opens more questions than it provides answers.  “This is an exciting new discovery, and potentially a major contribution to our knowledge about the Great Pyramid,” Peter Manuelian, a Harvard Egyptologist not involved in the research, says in an email.  A new chamber could provide clues to how the pyramid was constructed. Or, more tantalizingly, it could contain treasure. The Great Pyramid was ransacked and looted millennia ago. This void could represent the last untouched portion of the structure.  But it’s too soon to say any of this. “Most people want to know about hidden chambers, grave goods, and the missing mummy of King Khufu. None of that is on the table at this point,” Manuelian says.  The ScanPyramids team currently has no concrete plan to get inside the void, and they have much more work to do to pinpoint its location in the pyramid. The muons only give a blurry, rough sketch.  “For the time being we cannot allow ourselves [to start drilling bore holes into the void],” says Hany Helal, vice president of the Heritage Innovation Preservation Institute, which runs the ScanPyramid project. “We need to continue the research with nondestructive techniques, which will allow us to have a complete picture of what is inside.”  Once there’s consensus on the exact dimensions of the void and its location, then a team can drill a small hole and deploy a robot drone to explore it.  “We can’t allow for trial and error,” Helal says.

The proposal, which was touted as a ""game changer,"" would add $1.5 trillion to the nation's debt over the next decade as Republicans largely abandoned fiscal discipline in a plan that could secure a legislative achievement for President Trump and score a political win ahead of next year's midterm elections.

A summary of the plan, which was made available to reporters ahead of its public release, would also reduce the cap on the popular deduction to interest on mortgages to $500,000 for newly purchased homes. The current cap is $1 million.  The plan also limits the deductibility of local property taxes to $10,000 while eliminating the deduction for state income taxes. Republicans in high-tax states such as New York and New Jersey had come out strongly against it.  “I view the elimination of the deduction as a geographic redistribution of wealth, picking winners and losers,” New York Republican Rep. Lee Zeldin said. “I don’t want my home state to be a loser, and that really shouldn’t come as any surprise.”  Called the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the GOP plan would also leave the top individual tax rate at 39.6 percent.  The child tax credit will rise to $1,600 from $1,000, though the $4,050 per child exemption would be repealed.  The legislation is the first major revamp of the U.S. tax code in three decades and has been a top legislative and political priority of Republicans.  “This is the beginning of the end of this horrible tax code in America,” Rep. Kevin Brady told Fox News.  House Speaker Paul Ryan touted the plan as a break for the middle class.  “It is for the families who are out there living paycheck to paycheck who just keep getting squeezed,"" he said.  President Trump called the legislation ""another important step toward providing massive tax relief for the American people"" and added, ""We are just getting started, and there is much work left to do.""

For this reason, we have zero sympathy for Perez. He’s as dirty as they come…  He tried to dodge an opportunity to address Donna Bazile’s Thursday piece in Politico that touted “Hillary Clinton’s secret takeover of the DNC.”  Trending: AMERICA’S BIGGEST LOSER Explains Why Multiple Sexual Assault Claims Against Bill Clinton Are Not As Serious As Kavanaugh’s…Calls For CIVIL WAR! [VIDEO]  Perez appeared on CNBC today where, after focusing primarily on the GOP tax reform proposal, host Carl Quintinella asked the DNC chairman about Brazile’s allegations…Ouch!    Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court? Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?  Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court? * Yes, he will be confirmed. No, he will not be confirmed.        THE IMPLOSION OF THESE GRIFTERS IS FUN TO WATCH…  Brazile claimed in the piece that the DNC was put on a “starvation diet” and became dependent on Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign for survival.  HAHA! “HAVE YOU READ THE PIECE?”  “I can’t let you go, Tom, since you’re with us, without asking if you‘ve read Donna Brazile’s piece about the DNC that’s in Politico today. Any comment at all?” Quintinella asked.  DID YOU NOTICE THE DODGE? “WELL HEY, WE’RE MOVING FORWARD”  “Well hey, we’re moving forward; we’re building, you know. I’ve been asked that question a number of times since I started,” Perez started.  The DNC chairman continued by talking about the Democrats’ plans to create a transparent nomination process for 2020.  “And, one of my goals here as DNC Chair is to make sure that the nominating process for 2020 is a process that’s totally fair and transparent for everybody,” Perez said.  He continued to avoid addressing the Brazile allegations directly, instead focusing on what the DNC will do moving forward.  “We’re going to set the primary debate schedule well in advance of when we know who the candidates will be there,” he said. “We have to make sure that everything is fair and open, and everybody has a fair shake. That’s what we’re going to do.”",1.8571428571428572,7,"[0.5, 1.5, 5.0, 0.5, 1.5, 0.5, 3.5]"
