1756,10/6/17,,12,31,2099,Is There Any Reason Not to Get a Flu Shot?,"Q. Is there any reason someone should not get a flu shot?  A. Health officials urge all Americans 6 months and older to get an annual flu shot — except for those who have ever had a severe or life-threatening allergic reaction to an influenza vaccine or vaccine component. Individuals who have had severe allergic reactions to a flu vaccine “should not get the vaccine again,” said Dr. Lisa Grohskopf, a medical officer with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  For years, people with egg allergies were also warned to avoid flu shots, since eggs were used to help make the vaccine. But the current recommendation is to go ahead and be vaccinated, Dr. Grohskopf said. Though eggs may still be used in the manufacturing process, the amount of egg protein present in the vaccine is so small it is unlikely to cause a reaction, Dr. Grohskopf said. Even when someone has a severe egg allergy, she said, “we still recommend they be vaccinated, but have it done in a medical setting with a provider present, who can recognize and manage an emergency reaction.” Influenza vaccination is also recommended during pregnancy, to protect both the mother and baby.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/well/live/is-there-any-reason-not-to-get-a-flu-shot.html
1763,8/5/19,,12,31,2099,This cartoon explains why predicting a mass shooting is impossible,"In the wake of mass shootings, many people wonder how they could have been prevented. Were there warning signs that should have been heeded? Was the person mentally ill? Did he or she hold extremist views?  It’s a question we’re bound to ask after awful attacks like the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 dead. President Donald Trump’s response, in part, was to call for increased focus on mental health care to potentially prevent similar attacks. (Though, as Dylan Matthews explains, it’s largely a myth that poor mental health is associated with mass violence.)  The sad truth is that the only personal factors that reliably correlate with mass shooters are being young and being male. There are a lot of angsty young men in this country. That makes prediction hard.  But what makes prediction even harder is just how rare these instances of mass shooting are. Yes, America has a gun violence problem. But the vast majority of people will never commit such a crime. Even if we said one in a million people will become mass murderers, that would be too high an estimate. There are 323 million people in the United States.  The fact that there are so few mass shooters and so many more harmless people makes it actually mathematically impossible to predict who might become a mass shooter.  New York magazine’s Jesse Singal made this point after the shooting at Umpqua Community College in 2015. “It would be nice to think we could sidestep the gun-control issues,” he wrote, and focus on quantifying the mental health and behavioral warning signs in would-be shooters.  But that would be an exercise in futility. Last year, Sanjay Srivastava, a psychologist at the University of Oregon, walked us through a thought experiment to consider.  ”Even with very good detection procedures, when you’re talking about rare events, [prediction models] do not work the way you might think,” he said.  Even a prediction model that’s 99 percent accurate would be of no use.  Let’s see why.  Imagine scientists invent a machine that can predict who will commit an act of terrorism or mass murder  This is science fiction, clearly. But if we could invent such a machine, we’d want it to analyze the intricate regions of a person’s brain and then determine his intent and willingness to commit a mass crime.  In addition to mind reading, we’d want it to track a person’s online behavior, social connections, and purchasing decisions and use that data to determine who is a would-be mass killer.  For the purposes of this example, let’s assume it works absurdly well.  This machine is 99 percent accurate  This 99 percent accuracy is also science fiction. We’re not even that good at predicting the weather, let alone the complexities of human behavior.  But you’d have faith in a system that was 99 percent accurate, wouldn’t you?  It would mean that it would correctly identify mass shooters 99 percent of the time and correctly identify peaceful citizens 99 percent of the time.  This sounds pretty good. Let’s see how well it analyzes 100,000 people.  Let’s assume that there’s actually one future mass shooter lurking in this group of 100,000 people.  The machine is 99 percent accurate, so it labels 99 percent of these “harmless” people correctly. Hooray!  More good news: The machine should also theoretically correctly identify the mass shooter.  So from our initial group of 100,000 people, we’re left with a list of 1,001 potential mass shooters  What? I thought this thing was 99 percent accurate! What junk!  Well, it is 99 percent accurate. But that means it will falsely label one out of every 100 people a mass shooter.  In a group of 100,000 people, we’d be left with 1,001 potential mass shooters: 1,000 false positives and one correct guess.  It’s likely the machine did correctly guess who the mass shooter will be. But he’s hidden among the false positives.  If we ran this machine on all US citizens, it would identify around 3.2 million people as mass shooters  What does the government do with this information? Monitor all 3.2 million potential killers? Wiretap all their homes?  This isn’t feasible.  In the wake of the horrendous shooting in Norway in 2011 that left more than 70 people dead, the Swedish Defense Research Agency looked into whether it would be possible to monitor social media to identify would-be mass shooters. Here’s what the agency wrote in a 2014 paper:  To produce fully automatic computer tools for detecting lone wolf terrorists on the Internet is, in our view, not possible, both due to the enormous amounts of data (which is only partly indexed by search engines) and due to the deep knowledge that is needed to really understand what is discussed or expressed in written text or other kinds of data available on the Internet, such as videos or images.  The lesson here is that it’s much easier to look backward and assume the warning signs were there and could have been spotted.  ”But that’s going the wrong way — it’s hindsight, not prediction,” Srivastava said.  ”Spend some time online and realize just how many young men there are saying angry things on the internet. Which ones are really dangerous, and which ones are just exercising their constitutional right to say angry things? The math just isn’t on your side.”  Prediction won’t work, so what will? Well, there’s an answer, but it’s not going to make a lot of people happy. Considering the mathematical hurdles of predicting killers, maybe stricter gun control is actually the easier option to reduce gun violence.",https://www.vox.com/2016/6/15/11934794/cartoon-predicting-a-mass-shooting-mathematically-impossible
1771,10/9/17,,12,31,2099,North Korea: What would a nuclear attack look like?,"One single reliable warhead fired by North Korea could destroy densely populated cities, killing millions.  Those who aren’t killed in a nuclear blast would be left with devastating injuries while their cities would be flattened with vital infrastructure destroyed.  A detailed analysis by 38 North, at the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, has revealed what would happen if Kim Jong-un did the unthinkable and actually fired a nuclear weapon.  In A Hypothetical Nuclear Attack on Seoul and Tokyo: The Human Cost of War on the Korean Peninsula, Michael J Zagurek paints a terrifying picture of the damage it could cause.  Assuming North Korea has 25 operational nuclear weapons with warhead yield ranges from 15 to 250 kilotons timed for airburst at optimal altitude, Zagurek runs through seven different scenarios.  The warhead yield ranges are based on current and possible future capabilities and the estimates of casualties were also based on the size of the city and population density.  In the most extreme estimate of a 250kt weapon being used, Seoul and Incheon which has a combined population of 24,105,000 would have 783,197 fatalities, and 2,778,009 injuries.  Tokyo and Yokohama with a combined population of 37,900,000 would have 697,665 fatalities and 2,474,627 injuries.  Maps showing four blast areas from a 250 kt airburst detonation also show how far the fallout and blast would reach.  North Korea has launched 98 ballistic missiles since 2011, including 19 this year.  However it remains unclear exactly how many warheads it possesses and how advanced they are.  Nuclear disarmament campaigner John Hallam said the analysis was fairly authoritative.  Mr Hallam speculated the DPRK (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) had between 40 and 60 warheads.  He also said he believed it will be a while before North Korea hit its nuclear goals.  “I’m also inclined to think that it will be a while before they fit a 250Kt warhead to more than one or two rockets,” he said.  “So 38 North analysis being based to a large extent on smaller warheads is not unreasonable — but the number of larger warheads will clearly rise over time.”  Mr Hallam said it was reasonable to assume Seoul and Tokyo were obvious targets but the analysis didn’t include an ability to strike US west coast cities.  “If that ability does exist, then it’s also possible for them to strike Sydney, which doesn’t mean they necessarily will — the highest priority target in Australia, indeed almost in the world — is Pine Gap, critical for US command and control,” he said.  “If US cities become part of the equation which they will in a year or two if they are not now, then that body count will be higher.”  He also pointed out the analysis didn’t take into account US President Donald Trump’s threat to wipe out the DPRK, which would increase the body count even further.  Mr Hallam said there would also be fallout which would also add to the huge casualty toll.  “It would be necessary to take into account the effects of fallout drifting in one direction all over South Korea, and in the other direction, into Manchuria,” he said.  “Maybe once Seoul has been leveled, which can be done without use of nukes at all, a little fallout from the rubble bouncing in the DPRK is of lesser consequence, but it needs to be taken into account somehow.”  Meanwhile Mr Trump said his administration’s goal was for North Korea to denuclearise.  “We cannot allow this dictatorship to threaten our nation or our allies with unimaginable loss of life,” he said.  “We will do what we must do to prevent that from happening. And it will be done, if necessary, believe me.”  The President had been discussing Iran and North Korea with US military leaders and posed for a photo with them before declaring the moment “the calm before the storm”.  “You guys know what this represents?” Mr Trump said after journalists gathered in the White House state dining room to photograph him and First Lady Melania Trump with the uniformed military leaders and their spouses.  “Maybe it’s the calm before the storm,” he said.  When asked what storm, Mr Trump replied: “You’ll find out.”  - with Reuters  This story originally appeared in news.com.au.",http://www.foxnews.com//tech/2017/10/09/north-korea-what-would-nuclear-attack-look-like.html
1773,10/9/17,,12,31,2099,The placebo effect has an evil twin that makes you feel pain,"The placebo effect is one of the most mystifying phenomena in medicine. When we expect a pill to make us feel better, it does. If we see others get better while using a medicine, we will too.  Doctors even see a placebo response in patients who are told they are on a placebo. And the more invasive, expensive, and drastic the placebo intervention, the greater the healing effect. Fake surgeries — where doctors make some incisions but don’t actually change anything — make people feel better than placebo pills alone.  But the placebo effect has an evil twin: the nocebo. It can kick in when negative expectations steer our experience of symptoms and create side effects where none should occur.  This means, incredibly, that you can get side effects from a sugar pill. And sometimes these side effects are so severe that patients drop out of clinical trials, as a 2013 paper in Nature Reviews explains. A review of fibromyalgia drug trials revealed that 72 percent of people who left the trial did so because they felt severe side effects while on placebo.  Or take statins, the most prescribed class of drug in America. They work to lower blood cholesterol and help prevent heart attacks. But people commonly report muscle aches while on the drug. Sometimes the aches are painful enough that people stop taking the drugs, which then puts them at risk for heart disease. Evidence suggests that the muscle aches might be a big nocebo.  There’s been a lot of recent scientific work trying to find ways to maximize the placebo effect, so that doctors can squeeze out the maximum therapeutic benefit from drugs. But scientists are also learning there are ways to minimize or maximize the nocebo effect too.  A fascinating October study in Science shows one possible way: When patients are led to believe one drug is less expensive than another, they’re also less likely to report painful side effects.  How expensive-looking packaging can alter perception of side effects  In the experiment published in Science, participants were told they were taking part in a study to test out a new anti-itch cream. They were also told the anti-itch cream had the side effect of making people more sensitive to heat.  The experimenters wondered: Could they manipulate the power of the nocebo effect, and make participants feel more or less pain after using the cream by priming them with an expectation?  In placebo studies, more expensive, involved procedures in which participants are aware of the higher cost and complexity tend to produce a higher placebo response. The researchers here wondered if the same applied to nocebo.  Half the participants were led to believe the drug was expensive. How: It came in a sleek blue packaging and was called “Solestan” — reminiscent of the expensive brand-name drugs you may see advertised on TV.  The other half of the participants were led to believe they were testing an inexpensive generic cream called “Imotadil-LeniPharma Creme,” which came in ugly orange-and-white packaging. It’s giving me a rash just looking at it.  A survey found that the participants did, indeed, rate the blue-packaged drug as costing more than the one in the stripped-down packaging. But in reality, both creams were the same placebo schmear, which contained no active drug whatsoever.  To test the side effect question, the researchers spread some cream on the participants’ arms. Then they hooked up that patch of skin to a device that delivered some mild heat. To fool the participants, they also hooked up another patch of untreated skin to the same machine. But they only turned up the heat on the patch of skin that had the cream. This trick was to ensure that the participants believed they were experiencing the side effect.  Then the trials began. Participants in both the expensive and inexpensive cream groups were exposed to the exact same levels of heat. The scientists kept asking: How much did that hurt?  There was a big, clear, unmistakable difference. The participants who had the “expensive” cream thought it hurt a lot more.  And what’s more: The effect increased over time. The more participants used the “expensive” cream — the more trials they underwent in the study — the more pain they felt.  How is this possible?  Like the placebo effect, the nocebo effect is influenced by expectations. And that’s what the researchers think is happening here. People guess a more expensive medication should be more potent and lead to more skin problems.  “The most likely explanation is that participants infer that expensive medication contains a more potent and effective agent and, consequently, produces more side effects,” the researchers conclude.  Some researchers suspect the nocebo effect is partly fueling the gluten-free diet fad. People have developed a negative expectation that eating gluten will make them feel bad. And so it does, even though they may not have any biological gluten sensitivity.  What researchers have realized in the past two decades is that the placebo and nocebo effects don’t just change how we talk about symptoms. Neuroscience studies find evidence that they actually change the way we perceive pain in the brain. And that’s what the researchers in this latest Science paper found too. An fMRI scan of the participants’ brains and spinal cords (which processes our pain response) provided evidence that not only were these participants saying they felt more pain, but they were experiencing it differently too.  Given the real therapeutic power of the placebo effect, there’s been a small but growing thread of research looking into whether it can be harnessed to help treat diseases. It’s surprisingly promising. Through placebo conditioning, it may be possible to maintain the same level of drug effectiveness while taking less of the drug. Overall, this research forces doctors to consider that the context in which medicine is given can make a big difference in how people feel.  But it’s still hard to know the best way to harness the placebo effect and downplay the nocebo effect. This Science study shows the healing power of the placebo isn’t limitless — because where placebo lurks, nocebo may lurk too.",https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/10/9/16435802/nocebo-effect-medicine-placebo
1803,10/9/17,,12,31,2099,"Columbus Memory Still Honored in Nation’s Capitol, Groups ‘On the Offensive’ to Defend his Legacy","Patriotic American organizations carried on the tradition, dating back to 1912, of honoring the memory of the discoverer of the New World at the Columbus Monument outside Washington, DC’s, Union Station, Monday.  The political climate surrounding the federal Columbus Day holiday and the memory of the man who sailed across the Atlantic did nothing to dampen the spirit of those who gathered to mark his achievements and significance.  “The only thing different was the weather,” J.P. McCusker, President of the National Christopher Columbus Association (NCCA) told  News, downplaying the impact of the recent controversies over Columbus’s legacy.  McCusker was also unfazed by calls by Antifa and other left-wing groups to disrupt what they wish to re-christen “Indigenous Peoples’ Day,” despite Park Service Police having told him they were stepping up security around Washington in light of recent vandalism incidents. “They’re trying to take history and rewrite it … they’re trying to make the heroes of yesterday the villains of today,” McCusker said of Columbus Day opponents.  The NCCA played the leading role in putting on the annual ceremony and was joined by, among others, the National Park Service, the Knights of Columbus, the Order Sons of Italy in America, the National Italian American Foundation, and the National Society Daughters of the American Revolution.  Statements were given by President Donald Trump and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser in recognition and support of the Columbus Day holiday for the crowd in front of the monument. A local Fairfax County, Virginia, high schooler read her contest-winning essay on hardships Columbus faced on his history-changing voyage without the benefit of modern maritime technology. The groups involved, as well as the ambassadors of Italy and Spain, where Columbus began his journey, later laid wreaths.  In recent weeks, the NCCA felt it necessary to launch a new website defending the legacy of Columbus in light of the escalation of the far-left’s campaign against traditional American history. McCusker told  News there was a “marked increase” in anti-Columbus agitation. “Columbus has been coming under attack for the last few years,” he said. “The oldest statue of Columbus in the world, in Baltimore, was vandalized, and we see other statues being vandalized.”  “We wanted to take the offensive. In years gone by we’ve been on the defensive,” McCusker explained. “When they’re accusing Columbus of genocide? He didn’t commit genocide. He’s accused of starting slavery. Slavery was in [the Americas] long before Columbus was … He’s being accused of things that just didn’t happen.”  McCusker preferred to focus on the undisputed, remarkable achievement that made Columbus famous and the American nation possible. “When he set sail, there were no navigational charts. He set out into the blue convinced that if he sailed west, he could get to the east … he brought to this hemisphere Christianity and he brought the Europeans … he started something that’s become the greatest country in the world.”  “We have nothing against the indigenous citizens,” McCusker concluded. “They want their day; we’re all for it. We just don’t want them to take Columbus Day.”",http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/10/09/columbus-memory-still-honored-in-nations-capitol-groups-on-the-offensive-to-defend-his-legacy/

President Trump Offers Congress Hard-Line Deal On Immigration…Shines Spotlight On Democrats' Agenda To Put Votes Before American Citizens ,"If Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer were under the impression that they were leading the negotiations on DACA, the border wall and issues related to illegal immigration, that all changed today. The Democrats failure to protect our nation from criminals and terrorists, and to protect the earnings of hard-working Americans, will be laid bare for all to see if they don’t agree to President Trump’s latest proposal to Congress.  AP– President Donald Trump has told congressional leaders that his hard-line immigration priorities must be enacted in exchange for extending protection from deportation to hundreds of thousands of young immigrants, many of whom were brought to the U.S. illegally as children.  Trump’s list of demands included overhauling the country’s green-card system, a crackdown on unaccompanied minors entering the country, and building his promised wall along the southern border.    Many were policies Democrats have said explicitly are off the table and threaten to derail ongoing negotiations over legislation protecting young immigrants known as “Dreamers.” They had been given a reprieve from deportation and the ability to work legally in the country under President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which Trump ended last month.        *    Email *  Name      In a letter to House and Senate leaders released by the White House Sunday, Trump said the priorities were the product of a “a bottom-up review of all immigration policies” that he had ordered “to determine what legislative reforms are essential for America’s economic and national security.  “These findings outline reforms that must be included as part of any legislation addressing the status of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients,” he wrote, adding that: “Without these reforms, illegal immigration and chain migration, which severely and unfairly burden American workers and taxpayers, will continue without end.”  Trump announced last month that he was ending the DACA program, but he gave Congress six months to come up with a legislative fix before recipients began to lose their status. Trump suggested at the time that he was eager for a deal, telling reporters, “I have a love for these people and hopefully now Congress will be able to help them and do it properly.”  He’d also tweeted that if Congress was unwilling to find a fix, he would “revisit this issue!” in six months. –",https://100percentfedup.com/brilliant-president-trump-offers-congress-hard-line-deal-immigrationshines-spotlight-democrats-agenda-put-votes-american-citizens/

The messages suggest that the meeting was not set up to pass on damaging information about Hillary Clinton on behalf of the Russian government.  Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya believed she was meeting President Donald Trump’s oldest son to discuss the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 sanction law aimed at top Russian officials, and did not have information on behalf of the Kremlin to pass on to the Trump campaign, according to the emails.  In an email chain between music publicist Rob Goldstone and Veselnitskaya, she asks to invite Russian-born lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin to the meeting, saying he was “working to advance these issues with several congressmen,” the Wall Street Journal reported.  “He has invaluable knowledge about the positions held by the members of the Foreign Relations Committee that will be important to our discussion,” she adds. Akhmetshin has worked to overturn the Magnitsky Act.  Following a New York Times report in July, Trump Jr. was accused of taking the meeting, organized by Goldstone, knowing that the attorney had damaging information on Clinton coming from the Russian government.  Goldstone said at the time that he could set up a meeting to provide “very high level and sensitive information” compromising Clinton’s election chances as part of “Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.”  “If it’s what you say, I love it,” Trump Jr. wrote in response to the request for the meeting.  Following the controversy, Don Jr. defended himself, saying Veselnitskaya did not have any information and in fact wanted to focus on other non-election-related issues. She echoed his view on multiple occasions, saying the Magnitsky Act -- a U.S. attempt to punish Russian officials after the death of a whistleblower -- had always been the reason for the meeting.  The emails were released by Scott Balber, an attorney for Aras Agalarov, who helped to organize the meeting with Trump Jr.  Balber said the emails were released to contradict Goldstone’s remarks and bolster the case that the meeting in fact had nothing to do with the Kremlin’s attempt to collude with the Trump campaign.  He also told the Journal that the Russian lawyer has been fighting the Magnitsky Act for years and reached out to numerous Russian authorities.  As part of her effort against the sanction law, she had a five-page set of talking points, including one reference to Clinton, suggesting a U.S. company, Ziff Brothers Investments, had avoided taxes in Russia and donated to the Democratic Party, possibly Clinton.",http://www.foxnews.com//politics/2017/10/11/trump-tower-meeting-wasnt-about-clinton-dirt-emails-show.html

Well, actually Hillary really didn’t come out and make a statement, true to form, Hillary hid behind her former State Department communications director, Nick Merrill, as he posted a response on behalf of Hillary about the monster predator, and one of her top donors to her presidential campaign, the virulently anti-Trump, Harvey Weinstein.  Perhaps the delay in the statement was due to the pressure from Americans for Democrats to return or donate campaign contributions from the disgraced scumbag Hollywood kingpin.    From Deadline: Something in the neighborhood of $1.8 million was raised at Harvey Weinstein’s star-packed fundraiser for Hillary Clinton in New York City Monday night, sources tell Deadline. The event for 50 or so Clinton supporters at Weinstein’s Manhattan home drew some major Hollywood names, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lopez, Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick, Candice Bergen, Bethenny Frankel and designers Vera Wang and Tory Burch.        *    Email *  Email      Don’t hold your breath waiting for Hillary to return the $1.8 million that Weinstein and his co-hosts Jennifer Lopez, Sarah Jessica Parker, Matthew Broderick and Leonardo DiCaprio raised for Crooked Hillary’s presidential campaign.

1875,10/11/17,,12,31,2099,9 Republicans Co-Sponsoring More Gun Control for Law-Abiding Americans,"Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-FL) introduced gun control aimed at law-abiding Americans on Tuesday. His bill has nine Republican co-sponsors, which means nine Republicans are willing to punish every law-abiding American for the behavior of one criminal in Las Vegas.  And they are doing all this to ban bump stocks, a product the ATF evaluated and approved in 2010.  The ATF approved the stocks because they are accessories for semiautomatics rather than conversion devices that turn semiautomatics into fully automatic weapons. Curbelo’s bill gets around the ATF’s approval by explicitly banning certain accessories for AR-15s, even if those accessories “[do] not convert the semiautomatic rifle into a machine gun.”  And like the Democrat bill–put forward by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA)–Curbelo’s bill is already broader than bump stocks alone. In other words, it is a ban that will keep on giving for the Democrats and other gun control proponents.  Here are the nine Republicans who are co-sponsoring Curbelo’s bill:  Rep. Peter King (R-NY) Rep. Leonard Lance (R-NJ) Rep. Patrick Meehan (R-PA) Rep, Ed Royce (R-CA) Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ) Rep. Erik Paulsen (R-MN) Rep. Ryan Costello (R-PA) Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL) Rep. Charlie Dent (R-PA)  The push to ban bump stocks is especially rich in light of the fact that using the devices probably made the Vegas attacker less effective than he would have been without them. After all, bump stocks are made for novelty rather than precision. For this reason, U.S. Army Sergeant First Class special forces soldier Tony Cowden suggests the Vegas attacker could have been deadlier if he had shot slower with a rifle not outfitted with a bump stock:  Bump stocks may have made Paddock less deadly https://t.co/90ddK51Y8w pic.twitter.com/eC42rf8k11 — Justin Miller (@justinjm1) October 4, 2017  Moreover, the effect one achieves with a bump stock can be achieved with an index finger and a belt-loop; no bump stock device needed. So what will Republican gun controllers do if they ban bump stocks and realize that people are still having fun with their rifles via blue jean belt loops? Will they ban belt loops?  In summary–Bump stocks are accessories, not conversion kits. They are novelties that reduce accuracy by producing a short, rapid-fire effect that can be achieved using nothing more than a finger and belt loop. For these reasons, Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) stresses that bump stock gun control is part of a larger misdirection that creates a “slippery slope” Democrats can exploit for more gun control in the future. Yet Reps. Peter King, Leonard Lance, Patrick Meehan, Ed Royce, Chris Smith, Erik Paulsen, Ryan Costello, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and Charlie Dent are rallying behind Curbelo’s gun control bill.

1884,10/11/17,,12,31,2099,Report: North Korean Hackers Targeted U.S. Power Grid,"According to a new report from security firm FireEye, “actors likely affiliated with the North Korean government” have attempted to hack American electric companies, in what appears to be “early-stage reconnaissance” for a possible future cyber attack.  FireEye’s analysis states that any such large-scale attack “might take months to prepare” if the reconnaissance had not been detected, so the threat was not necessarily “imminent.”  “We have not observed suspected North Korean actors using any tool or method specifically designed to compromise or manipulate the industrial control systems (ICS) networks that regulate the supply of power. Furthermore, we have not uncovered evidence that North Korean linked actors have access to any such capability at this time,” the report adds.  The hackers were evidently using “spear phishing” techniques, which essentially involve fabricating realistic-looking emails from trusted sources to trick users into opening malware-laced attachments or click links to virus-spreading websites.  Many of the largest data breaches in recent times are thought to have involved spear phishing, rather than the brute-force system penetration most people envision when they think of cyber attacks. Among other advantages, spear phishing can allow intruders to lurk inside compromised systems for extended periods undetected since they gained entry with legitimate passwords stolen from phishing victims.  FireEye recalls that North Korean hackers are believed to have planted malware in South Korean energy companies in 2014, but they did not damage or disable the power grid – they stole some sensitive documents and exposed them, “as part of an effort to exaggerate the access they had and embarrass the South Korean government.” A similar information-warfare strategy may have been in motion against American electric companies.  On the other hand, the report describes North Korea’s cyber espionage squads as “bold,” determined to “demonstrate national strength and resolve,” and largely devoid of “concern for potential discover and attribution of their operations.” North Korea is one of several nations that appears interested in developing the capability to disrupt power grids, either to attack the morale and economic strength of adversary nations during broader conflicts or to intimidate and deter potential opponents.  FireEye’s chief technology officer for the Asia-Pacific region, Bryce Boland, told CNN that North Korea “almost certainly has the capability to conduct disruptive and potentially destructive attacks, as well as more traditional cyber espionage operations.”  Boland added that North Korea’s isolation and generally backward economy give it advantages in cyberwar because it “has little connectivity and relatively limited reliance on technology.”  North Korean defector Kim Heung-kwang explained to CNN that Pyongyang aggressively cultivates and trains computer experts, managing a network of 250 elite computer schools and harvesting the most talented students for cyber warfare training at two special schools in Pyongyang. Kim added that some of the top graduates are sent to secretly work with China’s elite “Bureau 121” hacker squad.  Bloomberg Technology quotes South Korean defense estimates that North Korea now boasts an army of about 1,700 state-sponsored hackers, plus over 5,000 support staff.  NBC News cites its own previous reporting on North Korea’s interest in cyber attacks against U.S. infrastructure and quotes former FBI counterintelligence director C. Frank Figliuzzi calling FireEye’s report “a signal that North Korea is a player in the cyber-intrusion field and is growing in its ability to hurt us.”  Robert Lee, a cybersecurity consultant for the U.S. power industry, assured NBC that while infrastructure corporates are duly concerned about hacking threats, America’s adversaries are “far from being able to disrupt the electric grid.”  Although Lee said the electric grid is more secure than some of the more alarmed critics believe, Figliuzzi countered that some private utility companies are better equipped for cyberwar than others, and hostile powers like North Korea will “start looking for the weakest link.”",http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/10/11/report-north-korean-hackers-targeted-u-s-power-grid/

A potential primary challenger to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.) is signaling his intent to enter the race for the Senate seat she has held since 1992.    California Democratic state senate president Kevin de León will throw his hat into the ring to challenge Feinstein in the 2018 race, according to three sources who spoke to CNN. The 84-year-old senator announced Monday she would run for reelection, causing consternation on the progressive left even as she tried to get out ahead of de León.        *    Email *  Name      In the state senate, de León represents Los Angeles and has helped pass measures directed at President Donald Trump, positioning himself as one of the president’s fiercest critics. The California state legislature has opposed Trump’s agenda by becoming a so-called sanctuary state, as well as trying to force him to release his tax returns and even passing a resolution calling for him to apologize for “racist and bigoted behavior.”  Feinstein, however, took criticism from the left in August for expressing the hope that Trump would change to be more cooperative with Democrats.  “I just hope he has the ability to learn and to change, and if he does, he can be a good president,” she said, receiving boos from the San Francisco audience. She later said she is “under no illusion that it’s likely to happen and will continue to oppose his policies.”  De León will likely be one of multiple contenders for Feinstein’s seat. A source said Democratic mega-donor and environmentalist Tom Steyer is “very much looking at the Senate race,” and in a letter Wednesday he also called on Democrats to impeach Trump.  California has an open primary in which the top two vote-getters, regardless of party, face off in the general election. The primary will be held on June 5, 2018.

Fonda told Maher that one of the benefits of being a celebrity is that you can bring attention to things that need to be addressed, she then went on to refer to President Trump as the “Predator in Chief”. Of course, Hanoi Jane had no evidence whatsoever to back up such a hideous claim, yet, she made the claim anyhow. As it turns out, Hanoi Jane actually knew about a certain sexual predator who actually assaulted a much younger actress only one year ago. That younger actress was Rosana Arquette, who shared her horrible experience with the “celebrity” Jane Fonda. Fonda, who bragged about having so much power to bring attention to important issues, did absolutely nothing about it.  Hypocrite Hanoi Jane would rather stay mum about an actual sexual predator who was harming so many young women in her industry, than risk being ostracized in Hollywood. It was better to just stick to the “hate Trump” script and get along with the other sickening hypocrites in Hollywood than to expose a serial sexual predator who should’ve been stopped years ago if there weren’t so many self-serving and shallow human beings running around Hollywood.          *          Watch:  Hanoi Jane’s very comfortable trashing President Trump who she believes can’t hurt her career, but when it comes to the mega-Democrat donor, and Hollywood kingpin producer, Harvey Weinstein, all bets are off..

The accusations, including from some of the world’s most famous actresses, range from inappropriate massages to rape and date back nearly three decades.  While Fonda says she wasn’t harassed by Weinstein, she was told of his abuse last year by one of his victims.  I found out about Harvey a year ago and I’m ashamed I didn’t say anything back then,’ she told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour in an interview to air Friday.  When asked why she didn’t speak up back then, the 79-year-old actress said: ‘I was not that bold. I guess it hadn’t happened to me and I didn’t feel it was my place.’  She was informed of Weinstein’s transgressions by Rosanna Arquette – one of the many women who have since spoken out against the movie mogul.  ‘It came as a shock and a great disappointment,’ Fonda said.  ‘I only met Harvey when I was old and Harvey goes for young because that’s more vulnerable.’  She added that she was proud of the victims for speaking out but it wasn’t a unique or isolated case and specifically mentioned Bill Cosby’s history.  ‘This is not unique, this goes on at the most horrendous high levels,’ she said.  ‘I’m glad it’s coming out, I’m so proud of those fellow actors that are speaking up.

1949,10/13/17,,12,31,2099,Trump won’t pull out of ‘worst’ Iran nuclear deal _ for now,"President Donald Trump on Friday angrily accused Iran of violating the landmark 2015 international nuclear accord, blaming the Iranians for a litany of sinister behavior and hitting their main military wing with anti-terror penalties. But Trump, breaking his campaign pledge to rip up the agreement, did not pull the U.S. out or re-impose nuclear sanctions.  He still might, he was quick to add. For now, he’s tossing the issue to Congress and the other world powers in the accord, telling lawmakers to toughen the law that governs U.S. participation and calling on the other parties to fix a series of deficiencies. Those include the scheduled expiration of key restrictions under “sunset provisions” that begin to kick in in 2025, as well as the omission of provisions on ballistic missile testing and terrorism.  Without the fixes, Trump warned, he would likely pull the U.S. out of the deal — which he has called the worst in U.S. history — and slap previously lifted U.S. sanctions back into place. That would probably be a fatal blow for the accord.  “Our participation can be canceled by me, as president, at any time,” Trump declared in a carefully delivered speech read from a teleprompter in the Diplomatic Reception Room at the White House. He added later, speaking of Congress, “They may come back with something that’s very satisfactory to me, and if they don’t, within a very short period of time, I’ll terminate the deal.”  Under U.S. law, Trump faces a Sunday deadline to certify to Congress whether Iran is complying with the accord. That notification must take place every 90 days, a timetable that Trump detests. Since taking office, he has twice reluctantly certified that Iran is fulfilling its commitments.  On Friday, he said he would not do so again.  Trump alone cannot actually terminate the accord, which lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for concessions regarding its nuclear program. But withdrawing the U.S. would render the deal virtually meaningless.  That would be risky, though, and could badly damage U.S. credibility in future international negotiations. The accord was struck after 18 months of negotiations between the Obama administration, Iran, Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the European Union and then endorsed by a unanimous vote in the U.N. Security Council.  Trump’s main national security aides have all argued for staying in the deal. So have key allies in Europe who are leery of altering an accord that they believe has prevented Iran from assembling an arsenal of atomic weapons.  Overseas reaction to Friday’s speech was swift.  Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said that his country would continue to stick to the nuclear deal and that the U.S. was isolating itself, “more lonely than ever,” by condemning the accord.  Indeed, the leaders of Britain, Germany and France urged Trump in a joint statement not to do anything rash.  “We encourage the U.S. administration and Congress to consider the implications to the security of the U.S. and its allies before taking any steps that might undermine the (deal), such as re-imposing sanctions on Iran lifted under the agreement,” they said. Still, they added, “Independent of the (deal) we need to make sure that our collective wider concerns are being addressed.”  In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Trump and said the U.S. president had created an opportunity to “fix this bad deal” and roll back Iran’s aggression. Netanyahu has long warned that the accord failed to address Iran’s support for militant groups who act against Israel.  Trump opened his speech by reciting a long list of grievances with Iran dating back to the 1979 Islamic Revolution and the seizure of the U.S. Embassy and American hostages in Tehran. He then noted terrorist attacks against Americans and American allies committed by Iranian proxies, such as Hezbollah, and Iran’s ongoing ballistic missile tests.  “We cannot and will not make this certification” that Iran is complying with the accord, he said. “We will not continue down a path whose predictable conclusion is more violence, more terror and the very real threat of Iran’s nuclear breakout.”  But “decertifying” the deal stops well short of pulling out and simply moves the issues over to Congress. Lawmakers now have 60 days to decide whether to put the accord’s previous sanctions back into place, modify them or do nothing.  Republicans face a heavy lift in rallying GOP lawmakers and Democrats behind legislation that would make the accord more stringent and please Trump. Some GOP senators, like Marco Rubio of Florida, question whether the pact can be fixed.  Further complicating matters, a GOP lawmaker who will be at the center of what’s sure to be a stormy debate is Bob Corker of Tennessee, who recently compared Trump’s White House to “an adult day care center” and said the president could be setting the U.S. on a path toward World War III.  Ahead of Trump’s speech, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the administration wants lawmakers to come up with legislation that would automatically re-impose sanctions that were lifted under the deal should Iran cross any one of numerous nuclear and non-nuclear “trigger points.”  Those would include illicit atomic work or ballistic missile testing; support for Syrian President Bashar Assad, Lebanon’s Hezbollah movement and other groups that destabilize the region, or human rights abuses and cyber warfare, Tillerson said.  Also Friday, Trump said he was hitting Iran’s Revolutionary Guard with sanctions for supporting terrorism. But the U.S. is not adding the Guard to the formal U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations. That step would force the U.S. to take even further steps against the Guard that Tillerson says could be problematic.  ___  AP writers Deb Riechmann and Richard Lardner contributed to this report.","https://www.apnews.com//a660d3fd7e93484f82095122de8d4ff8/Trump-speech-to-vilify-Iran-over-nuke-deal,-non-nuke-issues"

1985,10/14/17,,12,31,2099,Global finance leaders warn against complacency,"White House senior adviser Ivanka Trump accompanied by World Bank President Jim Yong Kim speaks at the forum Taking Women-Owned Business to the Next Level, on the sidelines of the World Bank/IMF annual meetings in Washington, Saturday, Oct. 14, 2017. ( AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Global finance leaders on Saturday appealed to central bankers to stick as long as possible with low-interest rate policies that have made borrowing attractive and helped safeguard an improving but still fragile world economic recovery.  Declaring the “recovery is not complete” even eight years after the 2008 financial crisis, the 189-nation International Monetary Fund wrapped up its fall meetings with a communique warning “there is no room for complacency” as nations confront new challenges to global growth from a range of threats, including cyber-security attacks and more violent weather patterns linked to climate change.  The meetings also dealt, at least on the sidelines, with efforts to better understand the policy implications of the Trump administration’s more forceful “America First” agenda.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he had productive discussions during nearly 20 one-on-one meetings with other countries plus the joint sessions of the IMF and World Bank policy committees, as well as two days of talks centered on the Group of 20 major industrial countries.  Donald Trump won the presidency with pledges to toughen enforcement of U.S. trade laws and trim huge U.S. trade deficits with nations such as China and Mexico, which Trump has accused of unfair trade practices that have cost millions of American manufacturing jobs.  Mnuchin said he agreed with an assessment of German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble that the discussions this week were more relaxed than the initial talks held earlier this year, when the Trump team had first taken office, because there was a better understanding of Trump’s goals.  “We believe in free and fair and reciprocal trade,” Mnuchin told reporters Saturday, saying the Trump administration is simply trying to make sure U.S. workers and companies are treated fairly in trade deals with other nations.  Mnuchin said he carried in his pocket a list of all the G-20 nations and the size of the trade balances the United States has with each of those nations. With most of the G-20 countries, the United States is running a trade deficit.  Schauble, the chairman of the G-20 finance group this year, said he believed the backlash against globalization was giving way to a greater understanding that the path toward rising prosperity for all depends on greater cooperation among countries.  But the Trump administration so far has been highly skeptical of various multilateral organizations. This week, the United States pulled out of UNESCO, the United Nations’ cultural agency. It has scrapped an Asia-Pacific trade deal and is threatening to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. And it is has balked at providing additional capital to the World Bank unless the anti-poverty agency rethinks the way it distributes loans.  In his speech Saturday to the IMF policy group, Mnuchin said he wanted to see the IMF be a more “forceful advocate” for strong global growth by imposing more stringent surveillance on the economic policies being pursued by its member countries and by taking a hard look at changes that needed to be made by countries running large trade surpluses.  While the IMF communique called on major central banks to protect the global recovery by being cautious in withdrawing the support it has had in place since the 2008 financial crisis, in many cases the trend seems to be moving in the opposite direction.  In the United States, the Federal Reserve has raised short-term interest rates twice this year and is beginning to reduce its large portfolio of bonds, a move that could push long-term rates higher. In Europe, the euro currency has risen since spring on expectations that the European Central Bank will withdraw its long-standing stimulus program. The ECB meets Oct. 26.  “Monetary policy should remain accommodative, where inflation is still below target and output gaps” still exist, the communique said.  On Saturday, Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and a White House adviser, appeared with World Bank President Jim Yong Kim to launch a World Bank initiative to support women entrepreneurs. The World Bank fund has raised $350 million, which is designed to allow the World Bank to deploy at least $1 billion in capital to finance women-owned businesses.  Ivanka Trump told the audience she wanted to “spend a lot of time offering any value that I can as a mentor.”","https://www.apnews.com//83f1dd641a844512a96e831d4091a5c5/IMF,-World-Bank-push-back-against-globalization's-detractors"

SHERYL SANDBERG: CONGRESS SHOULD RELEASE FACEBOOK ADS TO THE PUBLIC  While he noted that the Like button succeeds at some things like drawing attention to a friend’s interests or acting as a catalyst for “positive sentiment,” it also results in gobs of “time wasted” when looking at videos that “don’t nourish your life” or are just constant distractions that are unproductive and disruptive.  This topic was recently highlighted in The Guardian, which said that smartphone use (and technology in general) is not just addictive, but it contributes to “continuous partial attention,” wreaking havoc on people’s ability to focus and potentially making them dumber.  “One recent study showed that the mere presence of smartphones damages cognitive capacity – even when the device is turned off,” the article noted.  Many of these early technologists are now “weaning themselves off their own products” and teaching their children to put down iPhones, iPads, and laptops, the Guardian added. However, the problem is large technology companies often define success as “time spent on site,” Rosenstein wrote.  Rosenstein is now co-founder of a workplace software startup, known as Asana, and is currently working on an app that seeks to address some these issues.  ZUCKERBERG BLASTED FOR VR TOUR OF HURRICANE-RAVAGED PUERTO RICO  Use versus abuse  ""You need to define addiction. A lot of people just like to use the technology a lot"" but aren't necessarily addicted, Nir Eyal, author of ""Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products,"" who has taught at Stanford Graduate School of Business and Design School, told .  ""If you throw around this word 'addiction,' it really hurts people. It disempowers people to take control of it. 'It's not my fault, it's the technology's fault.'"" Eyal said, adding if you shirk personal responsibility, you're more likely to relapse.  But companies do have a ""moral imperative"" to at least try to help real addicts. ""We have personally identifiable information who is using and who is abusing,"" he said.  For example, a company could have a policy where ""if you use our product more than X number of hours per week, we're going to reach out to and ask if we can help you,"" he said. And if they are receptive and accept the offer for help, then the company can step in, he said.  ""Whining about this to a company is not going to stop anything. To whine to a company like Facabook or Google to make their product less good is a fool's errand,"" he added. ""They are not going to change how great their products in terms of how engaging they are.""",http://www.foxnews.com//tech/2017/10/13/facebooks-like-button-creator-has-second-thoughts-calls-it-time-waster.html
2003,10/15/17,,12,31,2099,"Trump too tough on Iran, North Korea, Clinton says","With his tough talk and hardline stances on Iran and North Korea, President Donald Trump is damaging America’s credibility abroad – and could provoke a nuclear-arms race in East Asia, Hillary Clinton says.  Trump's recent threat to decertify the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, “makes us look foolish and small and plays right into Iranian hands,” Clinton said last week.  ""That is bad not just on the merits for this particular situation, but it sends a message across the globe that America's word is not good,"" said Clinton, who spoke in advance of Trump's announcement Friday that he wants Congress and the other nations that negotiated the deal to toughen the requirements for Iran.  ""This particular president is, I think, upending the kind of trust and credibility of the United States' position and negotiation that is imperative to maintain.""  ""This particular president is, I think, upending the kind of trust and credibility of the United States' position and negotiation that is imperative to maintain."" — Hillary Clinton  For his part, Trump says that Clinton, as secretary of state under former President Barack Obama, helped negotiate a “terrible” deal with Iran.  Getting tough on Iran is the right approach, the president said.  “We will not continue down a path whose predictable conclusion is more violence, more terror and the very real threat of Iran’s nuclear breakout,” Trump said Friday, according to the Washington Times. “Iran is not living up to the spirit of the deal.”  Clinton also denounced Trump's bellicose language toward North Korea, saying his verbal aggression has rattled U.S. allies.  ""We will now have an arms race — a nuclear arms race in East Asia,"" Clinton predicted. ""We will have the Japanese, who understandably are worried with missiles flying over them as the North Koreans have done, that they can't count on America.""  Clinton stressed that a diplomatic solution was preferred, and suggested the inflammatory rhetoric played into Kim Jung Un's hands. She bemoaned Trump's public undercutting of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson when he tweeted ""Save your energy, Rex"" after the nation's top diplomat had suggested negotiations.  “Diplomacy, preventing war, creating some deterrents is slow, hard-going, difficult work,” said Clinton, who declined to answer when asked whether Tillerson should resign. ""And you can't have impulsive people or ideological people who basically say, 'Well, we're done with you.'""  Trump on Sept. 21 signed an executive order calling for a new round of economic sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.  The president said the actions were aimed at “a complete denuclearization of North Korea,” the Washington Times reported.  “North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile development is a grave threat to peace and security in our world,” Trump said. “It is unacceptable that others financially support this criminal rogue regime.”  Clinton, who recently released a book that recounts her election defeat to Trump, has been an aggressive critic of the president.  In an interview with Britain’s BBC on Friday, Clinton called Trump a “sexual assaulter.”  Clinton made the comments when asked about the allegations of sexual assault made against Democratic mega-donor and Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.  “This kind of behavior cannot be tolerated anywhere, whether it's in entertainment, politics,” Clinton said. “After all, we have someone admitting to being a sexual assaulter in the Oval Office.”  In the same interview, Clinton referred to the sexual transgressions of her husband – former President Bill Clinton – as being “clearly in the past,”  reported.  Clinton’s comments on Iran and North Korea were scheduled to air Sunday on CNN. The White House did not immediately return a request to respond to her remarks.

2008,8/9/18,,12,31,2099,It’s easy to become obese in America. These 7 charts explain why.,"It’s no secret that Americans have gotten much, much bigger over the past few decades. The signs are all around us, from XXXL clothing sizes to supersize movie seats and even larger coffins.  According to an analysis from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the average American man now stands at 5-feet-9 1/4 inches tall and weighs 196 pounds — up 15 pounds from 20 years ago. For women, the change has been even more striking: The average female today stands 5-feet-3 3/4 inches and weighs 169 pounds. In 1994, her scale read 152 pounds  The latest CDC estimates now show that, as of 2016, 40 percent of US adults and 19 percent of youth were obese.  This data on the state of our weight comes from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES), a combination of interviews and physical examinations that's considered the gold standard measurement. Since the 1980s, the NHANES has been charting obesity rates — and extreme obesity rates — as they've soared.  Alongside the rise in obesity, we’ve also seen growing rates of associated chronic disease — like diabetes, heart disease, and metabolic syndrome.  Clearly it’s gotten easier and easier to gain weight, and harder and harder to avoid it.  Atkins. Paleo. Keto. Do any of these diets work in the long term? We looked at the influence of marketing, food environments, and genes to explain why so many diets fail for Explained, our weekly show on Netflix. Watch now on Netflix.  So what’s going on here? There’s an obvious answer — we eat more than we burn off. But increasingly public health experts agree that we are not consciously choosing to overeat.  ""The food environment is a strong predictor of how we eat,"" says Scott Kahan, director of the National Center for Weight and Wellness and a faculty member at both Johns Hopkins and George Washington University. ""And in America, the unhealthiest foods are the tastiest foods, the cheapest foods, the largest-portion foods, the most available foods, the most fun foods.""  But why talk about how our food environment enables overeating with words when we can show it with charts? Let’s do it.  1) We eat out — a lot  Americans are cooking less and less and eating away from home more and more. And that’s leading us to chow down more than we would if we were home.  More than half of our food dollars are now being spent on restaurants and convenient on-the-go meals. In 2015, for the first time, Americans spent more money eating away from home than they did on groceries.  Sure, it’s possible to have a small, healthy meal at a restaurant. But researchers have found that people typically eat 20 to 40 percent more calories in restaurants compared with what they’d eat at home.  To understand why that happens, consider data from this recent study in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. The authors examined the nutrition content of more than 360 dinner entrees at 123 non-chain restaurants in San Francisco, Boston, and Little Rock between 2011 and 2014. The restaurant dishes contained 1,200 calories, on average — about half of the 2,000 or 2,500 calories recommended for moderately active women and men in an entire day.  2) Portion sizes have gone up, up, up  When we eat out, we’re not being served modest plates. The average restaurant meal today is more than four times the size of typical 1950s fare, according to the CDC.  These supersize portions are reflected in our daily calorie intake. The average American’s total caloric intake grew from 2,109 calories in 1970 to 2,568 calories in 2010. As Pew Research put it, that’s ""the equivalent of an extra steak sandwich every day.""  3) We guzzle sugary beverages on an unrivaled scale  People who drink soda have more obesity, Type 2 diabetes, tooth decay, and other health problems compared with people who don't -- the research on this is clear. And Americans are drinking way, way too much of the sweet stuff. According to Euromonitor’s most recent data, Americans remain the world leaders when it comes to per capita sales of soft drinks.  That said, one of the biggest public health wins of recent decades has been a slow shift away from soda in the United States.  With more awareness about the strong correlation between drinking sweet, fizzy drinks and obesity and tooth decay, sales of beverages like Coca-Cola and Pepsi have slumped.  But we may still be getting hoodwinked by other, equally sugary beverages. According to Euromonitor’s analysis of US retail beverage sales over the past five years, while the soda category is shrinking, juice sales have held steady, and sales of energy and sports drinks have been growing.  4) Healthier foods can cost more  The federal government recommends 1 1/2 to 2 cups of fruit and 2 to 3 cups of vegetables per day. According to the CDC, Americans in every state barely hit these minimum targets.  Fewer than 10 percent of American adults ate enough vegetables in 2013. Fewer than 15 percent consumed the recommended amount of fruit.  The Americans who aren’t eating broccoli don’t have a vendetta against it. Instead, there is a range of economic and social factors that make eating enough fruits and vegetables really hard.  Let’s start with cost: As you can see in the chart, when it comes to how many calories you get per dollar, sugar, vegetable oils, and refined grains deliver a higher bang for the buck than fruits and vegetables. In the long run, nutrients in food (like fiber, vitamins, and minerals) matter more for health than calories alone. But if your household income is low, you’re probably going for the cheapest, highest-calorie options.  5) Our vegetables consist mainly of potatoes and tomatoes  To make things more complicated, there’s a supply problem. We’re told to eat nutrient-dense foods like broccoli and Brussels sprouts instead of energy-dense foods like soda and french fries, yet there aren’t enough nutrient-dense foods to go around. Researchers have pointed out that if Americans actually followed the US dietary guidelines and started to eat the volume and variety of produce health officials recommend, we wouldn’t have nearly enough to meet consumer demand.  As of 2013, potatoes and tomatoes made up half of the legumes and vegetables available in this country, according to the US Department of Agriculture. And when we do eat tomatoes and potatoes, they’re often accompanied by so much sugar, fat, and salt that we’re propelled to overeat.  6) Too many of our meals are like dessert  American breakfast is often nothing more than disguised dessert. And we keep eating sugar throughout the day — in cupcakes, soda, even salad dressing.  So many of the additional calories in our diet that weren’t there a few decades ago are coming in the form of sugar. Back in 1977, the average adult got 228 calories per day from sugar in food and drinks. By 2010, it was up to 300 calories a day. Added sugar consumption increased almost as much — 20 percent — among kids.  Between 2003 and 2012, sugar consumption in adults and kids has come down a bit. But it’s still way too high.  ""Added sugars increase excess energy and reduce nutrient density in our diets, often contributing to weight gain and obesity,"" said Elyse Powell, one of the researchers at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill who crunched these numbers.  7) We’re bombarded with ads for unhealthy food  Sugary, oily foods are engineered to be consumed often and in big portions. But we’re not just influenced by their irresistible taste. The food industry is also terrific at marketing its products to us — and turning us into loyal consumers.  A 2006 report by the Institute of Medicine helped establish how the rise in obesity among kids corresponds to increasing marketing of unhealthy food and drinks to them. Since then, public health researchers have tracked food advertising — and have discovered how in some ways, this problem just keeps getting worse.  The UConn Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity found that in 2014, food companies spent $1.28 billion to advertise snack foods on television, in magazines, in coupons, and, increasingly, on the internet and mobile devices. Almost 60 percent of that advertising spending promoted sweet and savory snacks, while just 11 percent promoted fruit and nut snacks. And advertising of sweet snacks increased 15 percent, even from 2010 to 2014, according to Rudd’s analysis.  According to Jennifer Harris, director of marketing initiatives for the Rudd Center and lead author of the Rudd report, the public health community has pressured food companies to change how they advertise their products to kids. And there’s been some progress — 10 years ago, she says, companies argued that all of their products were healthy and there was no reason kids shouldn’t be eating them. ""Now there’s recognition that the marketing does affect kids’ diets in harmful ways. Now the discussion is around what’s healthy and what’s unhealthy. Now we’re in the details.""  But instead of promoting healthier foods, Harris says that companies have mostly reformulated their existing products to make them only slightly less unhealthy.  ""The sugar in kids' cereals has gone from an average of 12 to 13 grams to 9 to 10 grams,"" says Harris. ""But the cereal industry has products that do qualify as healthy, and yet they don’t advertise them to kids. The healthy cereals are advertised to parents, not kids.""  How the food environment could support healthful eating instead  With the expansion of our waistlines over the past 30 years, the factors in our environment that promote obesity — some of them outlined here — have come into focus. To reverse the trend, health officials have begun experimenting with a number of different policies.  First and foremost is taxation. Taxes helped wean people off cigarettes, and public health researchers think they may reduce consumption of fatty, sugary junk food. US cities (Berkeley and Seattle) and several countries (including the UK, France, Hungary, Chile, and Mexico) are experimenting with taxes on junk foods like soda. So far, the (very preliminary) research suggests the taxes may be helping to get low-income families off the sugary stuff — a win since those are the families most at risk of diet-related diseases.  Another tactic researchers argue should be widely tested is putting a warning labels and symbols on junk foods. There’s ample evidence that many people can’t make sense of the traditional food labels on the back of food packages: they too often require math, and some knowledge of nutrition. What’s more, they don’t always contain information about “nutrients of concern,” like added sugar. So countries like Chile have been experimenting with easier-to-understand warning labels on foods.  A variety of healthier foods — especially fruits and vegetables — also need to be made more affordable and readily available to Americans. To this end, nonprofits like Wholesome Wave have been working with government to offer fruit and vegetable subsidies for the poor, and even experiment with produce prescriptions (which are essentially vouchers handed out by doctors to patients with problems with food access).  Big food companies need to clean up their offerings, working with health experts to create alternatives that aren’t chockablock with fat, salt, and sugar. Kahan noted that many obesity researchers like him are working more closely with the industry. ""A lot of big players have made real specific declarations of making healthier products, smaller portions,"" he said.  The status of fruits and vegetables also needs to be lifted up, so that we see these options in our foodscape instead of only billboards for greasy hamburgers and candy. Here, too, there’s movement. A number of celebrities and even Olympic athletes have been working with nonprofit organizations and grocery stores to appear in colorful advertisements peddling everything from apples to tomatoes.  So progress is happening slowly, but it’ll take time to understand what, if any, impact this has on our health. As Kahan said, ""Transforming the food industry is one of the real uphill battles that will have to be fought over the next few decades.""",https://www.vox.com/2016/8/31/12368246/charts-explain-obesity

Bad idea…  Here’s the promotion for Lopez from the Children’s Diabetes Foundation on Twitter:  We are excited to announce that commedian & acotor @georgelopez will be the emcee for this year's #CarouselBall! https://t.co/cO9eHKviPO pic.twitter.com/aCpAI9F22a — CDF (@CDFdiabetes) September 21, 2017        *            Comic George Lopez was booed off stage at a gala for juvenile diabetes in Denver last week, over an anti-Donald Trump routine that fell flat with the crowd.  We’re told the flap began when Trump backer and Liberty Media CEO Greg Maffei donated $250,000 but requested that Lopez cool it with the anti-Trump jokes at the Carousel Ball.  An attendee at the event — where tables sold from $5,000 to $100,000 to benefit the Barbara Davis Center for Diabetes — commented on a YouTube video that “George was asked nicely to stop making Trump jokes by a man in front row [Maffei] who just donated $250K.” But “George doesn’t, continues. Gets booed.”  We’re told that Lopez responded to Maffei, “Thank you for changing my opinion on old white men, but it doesn’t change the way I feel about orange men.”  Trying to recover and sensing the audience turn, Lopez said, “Listen, it’s about the kids . . . I apologize for bringing politics to an event. This is America — it still is. So I apologize to your white privilege.”  We’re told Lopez also told a joke about Trump’s proposed border wall with Mexico, saying, “I guess you can get some Mexicans to do it cheaper and they wouldn’t crush the tunnels ­underneath.”  When the audience did not respond well, he quipped, “Are you El Chapo people?” in reference to the drug kingpin who has used tunnels to evade authorities.  Lopez then announced a video segment — but he did not return to the stage, and a local newscaster took over the hosting duties.

Albright College in Reading cut Gyree Durante from its team after he took a knee during the Star-Spangled Banner, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.        *    Email *  Name      According to the paper, the school promised consequences if players took actions different than those made in a special agreement.  The team’s “leadership council” decided that the squad would take a knee during the pregame coin toss, but stand for the national anthem.  “I knew the consequences. I knew that if I took a knee, that there would be a good chance that I would be kicked off.” “I didn’t like the whole taking a knee during the coin toss, I just thought it defeated the whole purpose of kneeing for the anthem. I get the whole team unity thing, but at the end of the day, I also thought that we should be allowed to be individuals, and express ourselves.” “The week before, I was watching NFL football, and I happened to see some of the remarks by President Trump about, uh, regarding NFL players taking a knee during the anthem, and he said that they should be fired, they should be kicked off and things like that. I already knew that it was an issue with, all of the racial and social injustice and you know, police brutality among African Americans and things like that. But when I heard the President say something about it, and, it was very negative, it just kinda struck a nerve with me and it made me think, if this is how the President feels, then Idefinitelyy need to take a need and protest this.” (Go here for video)  After Durante knelt, the Division III Lions went on to lose to Delaware Valley University, from nearby Doylestown, by 41-6.

2026,10/14/17,,12,31,2099,Northern Michigan University offers marijuana degree,"A university in Michigan is offering an unusual degree — in marijuana.  Northern Michigan University in Marquette began its medical plant chemistry program this semester, with about a dozen students in the first class, the Detroit Free Press reported . The program combines chemistry, biology, botany, horticulture, marketing and finance.  It’s an unusual program. Other universities offer classes on marijuana policy and law. And places such as Oaksterdam University, Cannabis College, and Humboldt Cannabis College, all in California; and THC University, the Grow School and Clover Leaf University in Denver offer certificates in a variety of disciplines. But Northern Michigan’s program is unique because the university is offering a four-year degree addressing the science and business behind growing marijuana.  “When they hear what my major is, there are a lot of people who say, ‘Wow, cool dude. You’re going to get a degree growing marijuana,’” said Alex Roth, a sophomore in the program. “But it’s not an easy degree at all.”  Brandon Canfield, an associate chemistry professor at Northern Michigan, said students don’t grow marijuana plants in the program, but instead look to other plants that are traditionally recognized with medicinal value but aren’t illegal to grow. Students learn how to measure and extract the compounds in the plants that can be used for medicinal purposes, then transfer that knowledge to marijuana, which has been used to treat a variety of illnesses, including chronic pain, nausea, seizures and glaucoma.  Canfield said he got the idea while attending the American Chemical Society’s annual meeting in San Diego last year.  “It was my off day and I saw there was a cannabis chemistry group that was putting on a whole series of talks,” he said. “I heard all about the need for analytical chemists and all sorts of interesting talks. That was the initial spark.”  University officials say the program fills a need because 29 states have legalized medical marijuana, including eight states where marijuana is also legal for recreational use.  “Many of the states are legalizing different substances and they’re really looking for quality people to do the chemistry and the science,” said university trustee James Haveman. “And it’s the university’s responsibility to produce those kinds of students for those kinds of jobs.”  In Michigan, voters in 2008 approved the use of marijuana to treat certain illnesses, but the law has confused many and has led to significant legal disputes, including over how to obtain and store the drug. The state is developing a new regulatory system aimed at increasing oversight and imposing new taxes on the industry.

Jessica Tunis told the AP that she put her mother’s name and picture up on Facebook as a plea for help, after she heard her say “I’m going to die” over the phone as her home caught fire in the Journey’s End Mobile Home Park. Tunis said that she was initially concerned about making a post. “At first, I don’t know what I was thinking, but I wanted to respect my mother’s privacy… I didn’t want to spread her all over the place,” she said.  Tunis’ post gained over 100 comments, from friends and strangers, giving prayers and support, suggestions of places to look, with some even going out to look for her mother themselves. “I’ve had people going to shelters for me because of Facebook,” Tunis said.  Her post was one of many seen on Facebook after the fires, with family unable to trace down their loved ones, hoping they were only in an area with downed communication lines, and not one of those who did not survive. Approximately 200 people were reported missing to the authorities in Northern California.  Messages on Facebook searching for missing people are relatively common after natural disasters. Similar posts were seen after the recent hurricanes Harvey, Rita and Maria, and after the shooting in Las Vegas last week. Facebook also has its own feature, Safety Check, for those in affected areas to tell everyone that they are safe. Safety Check was first introduced after the tsunami in Japan of 2014, and was primarily used for natural disasters. But after the Paris terror attacks of 2015, Mark Zuckerberg deemed it would also be used in “many other important conflicts.”",http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2017/10/11/facebook-used-after-disasters-to-search-for-family-members/
2064,10/15/17,,12,31,2099,Insider Q&A: US Bank’s Terry Sandven on stocks’ flip-flop,"This photo provided by U.S. Bank Wealth Management shows Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist for U.S. Bank Wealth Management. Sandven explains to The  how investors’ views of the market have evolved and doubled back in the 11 months since the 2016 election. (Courtesy of U.S. Bank Wealth Management via AP)  NEW YORK (AP) — On the surface, the stock market may not have looked any different in September than it did earlier in the year. But even though indexes continued to climb, the market went through a shift.  Starting in late August, banks and industrial companies rose and the dollar got stronger. The Russell 2000 index has climbed 11 percent from mid-August as smaller, U.S.-focused companies made big gains. That’s a change from the way stocks have behaved for much of this year: technology companies and other corporations that do a lot of their business overseas had been soaring as the dollar weakened, and low interest rates have hampered financial company stocks. But if the September pattern sounds familiar, it should: it’s the same trend that dominated the market from the November presidential election through President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January.  Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist for U.S. Bank Wealth Management, explains how investors’ views of the market have evolved and doubled back in the 11th months since the election. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.  Q: Why has the market changed direction in the last few weeks?  A: Tax reform seems to be gaining steam, and that’s boosted sentiment as well as expectations for President Trump’s pro-growth agenda. With tax reform you’re likely to see earnings favorably impacted, and a pro-growth agenda tends to be favorable for small caps as well. So the Russell 2000 has been on a tear. Tax reform tends to be U.S.-centric and is likely to boost earnings, which obviously is favorable for the broad market. Secondly, should a tax reform come to pass and result in an elevated dollar, that could conversely put some pressure on earnings for multinational companies.  Q: So in a lot of ways, stocks are making the same moves they made about a year ago. How is this move different from that one?  A: Following the November election (investors anticipated) a pro-growth agenda, expectations for inflation, deregulation and tax cuts. The pro-growth agenda now is gaining some steam again. The key difference between now and then is we have greater visibility on earnings. Earnings for the S&P 500 are tracking for about a 10 percent increase year over year and in 2018 we’re seeing that same kind of growth. The whole global economy is improving, which means higher earnings and higher earnings mean higher stock prices. We still don’t see a looming recession or ramping inflation. Stocks still provide an opportunity for investors to get yield as well.  Clearly the equity market valuations are elevated, but we think there is valuation support in an environment where inflation is low. But while our outlook remains constructive, clearly risks remain. You do have a flattening yield curve, there’s political wrangling and low expectations on balance and you’ve got geopolitical tensions.  Q: Are there other reasons for those gains, like improvement in the economy?  A: There’s still much to like about the U.S. equity market. Earnings are increasing and generally restrained inflation and low interest rates provide support. The large caps are somewhat in pause mode ahead of third-quarter (earnings) reports. We’re seeing consensus expectations for about a 5-percent increase in earnings year over year and higher earnings still warrant higher stock prices. We like the macroeconomic and fundamentals backdrops.  Q: Have you advised investors to make any changes in response to this market shift?  A: Our message has been the same, really. That is that we like equities over fixed-income securities and we like U.S. stocks over international even though international growth is improving. Nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are in positive territory year to date, (which) implies a market that’s likely to trend higher.

2070,10/16/17,,12,31,2099,"Tax reform needs to keep R&D investment here in the US, not overseas","As President Donald Trump redoubles his efforts to fulfill campaign promises on tax reform, a critical part of his program is in jeopardy of being discarded, as a result of the efforts of uninformed or self-interested business lobbies.  The measure under attack is a proposal to increase taxes on importers of foreign goods and reduce taxes on exporters of American goods. It must be restored if tax reform is to achieve its objectives of stimulating investment, preventing American companies from continuing to off-shore R&D and manufacturing, and avoiding increases in the deficit.  The fundamental problem to be fixed by overall tax reform is that American companies pay the highest taxes in the developed world. As a result, U.S.-based multinationals have been moving their headquarters, research and development, and manufacturing activities overseas to lower-tax locales, forcing us to import goods that we used to produce at home.  Companies that do stay home get to keep such a small share of returns on their capital that they cannot afford to make investments that would be good for everyone.  This has other cascading effects. Research and development (R&D) is one of the most important categories of investment, in that it drives growth in productivity and wages as well as profits and output. Without R&D and the innovations it produces, our standard of living would hardly be better than it was at the end of the nineteenth century.  According to the National Science Foundation, business R&D spending is now three times as large as government R&D, but since 2010 the basic research share of R&D has declined. Basic research is the place where innovations start, and needs the most encouragement.  Lowering tax rates would improve the profitability of all long-term investments, and the payoffs from R&D are among the most long-term of all.  As happens too often in Washington, the one liner – border adjustments raise prices – seems to be winning, because it takes three sentences to prove it is wrong. And few politicians have a high enough opinion of the electorate to take that chance.  Another tax reform proposal, to eliminate the deductibility of interest paid by corporations, would level the playing field for high-tech companies with large R&D budgets, because these high-risk investments cannot be financed with loans. Failures are as common as success in the early stages of innovation, and require investors to spread those risks across a portfolio of projects rather than lenders who require collateral and assurance of repayment.  The subsidy that the current tax code provides to banks and lenders by making interest but not dividends deductible therefore directs investment away from just the kind of innovative companies whose discoveries drive growth.  Finally, the R&D tax credit is one of the two current business tax credits retained in the reform proposals.  Unfortunately, these provisions are not sufficient to make the U.S. competitive with the inducements offered by other countries to attract R&D activities to their shores. That difference was to be taken care of by border adjustment provisions in the original tax reform plan, which was presented to Congress by House Speaker Paul Ryan and Chairman Kevin Brady of the House Ways and Means Committee.  What the measure sought to redress is the fact that other countries try to attract R&D centers by offering extremely low tax rates on income generated by R&D activities, including income from patents and licensing of new products as well as income from manufacturing them.  The kicker is that the R&D and manufacturing must be done in the country offering the tax breaks.  When U.S. companies relocate overseas in response to these inducements, they avoid almost all taxes by hiring workers and keeping profits overseas while exporting manufactured goods back to the United States.  Not only that, companies that remain home must pay these off-shoring companies to use the patents that they registered overseas. Even if some of the new products are manufactured in the U.S., a large part of the profits are thereby siphoned off to other countries.  The border adjustment was intended to fix this by eliminating the opportunity to deduct payments for imports, including payments for foreign patents, from business income.  At the same time, it would level the playing field with companies doing business in these low-tax nations by making income from exports tax-free.  The whole package of lower taxes, a level playing field in capital markets, continued R&D tax credits and the border adjustment would provide powerful incentives to invest in R&D within the United States and to produce here the new and better goods that are the fruits of R&D.  Unfortunately, the lobbying campaign against the border adjustment was underway long before anyone had a chance to explain how it would work.  Executives from Walmart, Target, and other big retail chains and off-shoring manufacturers like Nike descended en masse on Republican senators of the states in which they had headquarters to extract promises to oppose the border adjustments.  Their pitch was that the border adjustment would drive their prices up by 25 percent, because almost everything they sold was imported.  The damage had been done by the time Chairman Brady and a number of economists correctly pointed out that the brunt of the import adjustment would be borne primarily by foreign companies which would have to adjust their prices downward in order to maintain market share for the foreign-made products they sell into the United States.  Any residual upward pressure on prices in the U.S. would for the same reason be absorbed by retailers and other importers or quickly be neutralized by an increase in the value of the dollar in import transactions.  In other words, no real increase in consumer prices would be likely to occur.  As happens too often in Washington, the one liner – border adjustments raise prices – seems to be winning, because it takes three sentences to prove it is wrong. And few politicians have a high enough opinion of the electorate to take that chance.  We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reform the tax code in a way that will stimulate innovation and productivity growth for decades to come.  It is imperative that we not only move forward with tax reform, but ensure that it retains all the key provisions necessary to keep R&D happening here.  That includes the border adjustment.",http://www.foxnews.com//opinion/2017/10/16/tax-reform-needs-to-keep-r-d-investment-here-in-us-not-overseas.html

The ruling, by United States Circuit Judge William C. Bryson of the Eastern District of Texas, does not mean that generic versions of the drug will be available soon, however. Allergan said that it would appeal the decision, and the Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved copycat versions of the drug.  Still, the decision was a setback for the company, whose stock dipped more than 5 percent on the news. Restasis is Allergan’s second best-selling product, behind the wrinkle treatment Botox, bringing in nearly $1.5 billion in 2016.  In September, Allergan took the highly unusual step of paying the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe in upstate New York to take possession of the patents, which then were leased back to the company. The tactic was a way to protect the company from a patent challenge — separate from the federal court case — that is underway in an administrative proceeding before a unit of the United States Patent and Trademark Office.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/health/allergan-restasis-patent-.html

Behar suggested that Eminem was being brave because literally no one in Hollywood or the music industry has taken such a stand, “That’s why you need to give him [Eminem] credit because very few people in the industry will go out and say, ‘I don’t care if you don’t support me. This is more important than, than my popularity.’ I have never seen it, frankly.” Really Joy? What planet have you been living on for the past 2 years?  Co-host Sonny Hostin told the adoring liberal crowd, “I was actually at the hair salon watching the BET awards and the salon just um, roared when that happened.” She went on to condemn Trump for using Twitter and other means of communication to express his conservative views and then told the excessively liberal panel that, “I just thought it was very brave.”  Trending: DIRTY POLITICS: LEAKED AUDIO Exposes Attempted Cover-Up Of Dem Leader’s Sponsorship Of Bussed In Protesters  That’s when Meghan McCain, who appeared to be silently seething, as she listened to these morons speak to viewers as though they’re speaking to an audience who’s been living on an alternate planet, or don’t have any access to real news finally spoke up, saying, “Actually, It’s more socially acceptable to be a liberal in Hollywood.”        *    Email *  Name      That’s when Whoopi lost it…  Whoopi made a complete fool of herself when she embarrassingly attempted to prove that Meghan McCain doesn’t understand history and that communism in Hollywood was really a right-wing movement. Huh? Whoopi then doubled down and suggested in her condescending tone that a simple trip to Amazon to purchase a few books should help Meghan to understand the history of Hollywood, that of course, only Whoopi truly understands. Whoopi then embarrassed herself again when she tried to prove how many conservatives are working in Hollywood. The first example she used was comedian Tim Allen, whose top-rated show, “Last Man Standing” was just clearly canceled by ABC for political reasons. Whoopi then attempted to think of a second conservative actor and stumbled to finally land on Tom Selleck who hasn’t acted in a major movie or television show for decades. Selleck’s career peaked in the 1990’s. Outside of his occasional appearances on “Friends” as Monica’s boyfriend, Selleck’s career has been almost non-existent.  Meghan tried to explain to the panel that liberals are treated horribly in Hollywood and that it’s more socially acceptable to be a liberal in Hollywood than a conservative. She said that she lived in Los Angeles and that she was never more harassed than when she was living there. Meghan told that cast that it’s more popular to be an Obama and Hillary, and even Bernie supporter.  Whoopi then embarrassed herself again, when she tried to convince the panel that Meghan’s assertion that conservatives are blacklisted in Hollywood is ridiculous. Whoopi laughed and corrected McCain saying, ‘Except that all of the conservatives in Hollywood are working. They’re the ones that are working.” She tried to recall some examples of conservatives working in Hollywood. The first example she used was comedian Tim Allen, whose top-rated show, “Last Man Standing” was recently canceled by ABC for his political views.

The interview with local Australian TV has several delusional moments that reveal her continued bitterness and downright psychosis when it comes to the 2016 election loss to Donald Trump.    “I think Assange has become a nihilistic opportunist who does the bidding of a dictator,” Clinton said, apparently referring to Russia’s Vladimir Putin.        *          When the interviewer noted many people view Assange as a “martyr for free speech and freedom of information.”…Clinton wasn’t having it and shot back:  “I mean, he’s a tool of Russian intelligence. If he’s such a martyr for free speech, why doesn’t WikiLeaks ever publish anything coming out of Russia?”  The interviewer then did something our American media never does. She challenged Clinton with this question:  “Isn’t he just doing what journalists do which is publish information when they get it?”  HERE’S WHERE HILLARY GOES OFF THE RAILS:  “I don’t think so,” Hillary snapped. “I think for number one, it’s stolen information, and number two, if all you did was publish it, that would be one thing,” she asserted, before claiming there was a “concerted operation between WikiLeaks and Russia and most likely, people in the United States to, as I say, weaponized that information.”  Hillary Clinton says Julian Assange is a “tool of Russian intelligence”  HERE’S WHERE ASSANGE NAILS HILLARY:  Assange came back at Clinton with a PERFECT description of her “cold creepiness”. He tweeted out that people should “watch closely” and see that there is something “much darker” than the lying and “menacing glares”:    “There’s something wrong with Hillary Clinton. It is not just her constant lying,” he tweeted.  “It is not just that she throws off menacing glares and seethes thwarted entitlement. Watch closely. Something much darker rides along with it. A cold creepiness rarely seen.”  The interviewer goes on to ask Hillary about Fox News:  In more from the interview, it’s clear Hillary needs some therapy. She claims that Jim Comey “shivved her”. That is a prison term for being murdered with a knife. What the heck made her use that term? Now that’s REALLY creepy!

2122,10/17/17,,12,31,2099,House Republicans seek Mueller hearing testimony,"House Republicans have formally asked leaders of the Senate and House judiciary committees to convene public hearings to bring Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his legal team “out of the shadows” to testify on the Russia meddling probe.  Texas Republican Rep. Brian Babin, who began drafting a letter on the matter and gathering signatures over the summer, apparently has sent it -- with the support of 18 House colleagues.  The Oct. 13-dated letter was sent to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va.  In the letter, Babin asks that one or both committees hold one or more hearings with Mueller and his team, while acknowledging that some questions regarding sensitive information from the case should not be addressed.  However, he argues that Americans deserve information and accountability because, “They are, after all, paying for it.”  “This team has sweeping authority and an open-ended mission, yet they are allowed to operate largely in secret,” the letter states.  Co-signers on the letter include Reps. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., and Trent Franks, R-Ariz.  Mueller’s team has for roughly five months been conducting the investigation into Russian inteference and possible collusion with Trump associates during the 2016 presidential campaign.  Babin’s office shared the letter with  on Tuesday, one day after President Trump again denied any such accusations.  “There’s been absolutely no collusion,” the president said Monday at a Rose Garden press conference. “They ought to get to the end of [the investigation] because the American people are sick of it.”  Babin, a two-term congressman, argues in the four-paragraph letter that every nominee for U.S. attorney must be vetted and confirmed by the Senate. However, Mueller and his legal team -- “who are arguably just as empowered” -- have given Congress no such opportunity, he writes, while raising concerns about ""possible conflicts"" and ""political bias.""  Several members of Mueller’s team have given to campaigns or political action committees associated with Democratic politicians like Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama.  Mueller, a former FBI director, was appointed in May after Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the probe.  Mueller’s probe has reportedly moved into looking into the financial records of Trump and members of his campaign team, including those of former campaign manager Paul Manafort, whose home was raided by FBI agents looking for related documents.

The late Robert Morin, a 50-year staff member of the Dimond Library at the University of New Hampshire, shocked the community after his passing when they learned that he had left his entire $4 million fortune to the school. Morin, who was also a graduate of the university, asked that $100,000 of his fortune go directly to the library. He told his financial advisor that he trusted the school to “figure out what to do with” the rest.  Administrators drew the ire of students and alumni when they announced that they had decided to use $1 million of Morin’s gift for a video scoreboard for the school’s newly renovated football stadium. Community members weren’t happy with the decision, arguing that the stadiums $25 million budget should have been more than enough.  “Apparently, $25 million just wasn’t enough,” wrote one graduate, arguing that the decision is “a complete disgrace to the spirit and memory of Robert Morin.”  Another University of New Hampshire alumnus echoed the same sentiment: “I am not inherently opposed to some of the money going to the football program. I am opposed to it going to a scoreboard which, in the age of planned obsolescence, will be out of date in 5? 10? Years.”  “Use it to endow a scholarship for a player who wants to go to grad school maybe. … Pay it forward; make it meaningful,” she added.  Administrators at the University of New Hampshire tried to justify the decision by claiming that Morin became a passionate fan of the school’s football team in the last 15 months of his life. “In the last 15 months of his life Morin lived in an assisted living center where he started watching football games on television, mastering the rules and names of the players and teams,” the school wrote in a 2016 press release.  An investigative piece on the controversy published this week by Deadspin argues that the university used Morin as a marketing prop. “It was on measures like this that UNH cheated Morin by treating him less like a human being than a marketing prop,” author Craig Fehrman wrote. “This treatment had started early, of course, during those initial PR huddles, and it only got worse once a real backlash to the scoreboard emerged.”  “The librarian’s fandom had absolutely nothing to do with the scoreboard,” Fehrman added, “but through a careful and shameless juxtaposition, UNH implied that it had.”  Fortunately, $2.5 million from the gift will go towards a new career center for University of New Hampshire students and alumni.",http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2017/10/16/university-of-new-hampshire-uses-librarians-4-million-donation-for-football-stadium/

2143,10/17/17,,12,31,2099,MESSAGE TO HOLLYWOOD GOES VIRAL ,"This is the best yet! A message to Hollywood that went viral. It covers most of the things we think of when we think of the hypocrisy that runs rampant there:    Hollywood:        *    Email *  Phone      You lecture us about our carbon footprints while flying on private jets.  You preach feminism while brutalizing women.  You castigate violence while making millions off it in your movies.  You condemn guns, with armed bodyguards at your side.  You are the problem, not us.  WELL SAID!  LIBERAL HOLLYWOOD HAD THE WORST SUMMER IN 25 YEARS:  With the list of Hollywood actors and entertainers that Americans have decided to boycott over their sickening public hate for our President, is it really any wonder we’re seeing the worst box office numbers in 25 years?  Meryl Streep used her allotted time for accepting her lifetime achievement award at the Golden Globes to trash President Trump. At the start of her dramatic speech, Streep bemoaned to her fellow liberals that Hollywood “belong to one of the most vilified segments in America right now”. It appears that she hit may have actually the nail on the head. The problem with arrogant actresses like Meryl Streep who falsely believe that because they’ve been gifted with exceptional acting abilities, that Americans should fall in line with their radical political beliefs or we are ignorant.  ""As my friend…Princess Leia said to me once: take your broken heart, make it into art."" #MerylStreep pic.twitter.com/GzOHo7O729 #GoldenGlobes — Richard Hine (@richardhine) January 9, 2017  And then there’s Robert DiNero, who called candidate Trump “a punk,” “a pig” and “an idiot.” Only days before the election, DiNero angrily admitted that he would like to assault our soon to be President, claiming, “I’d like to punch him in the face”.  The list of Hollywood losers who have made vile, unfounded and even threatening remarks against a man who has put his very successful life on hold in an effort to save our nation is vast. The list of Hollywood losers who have said they would like to harm our President is also rather significant, starting with Madonna who got a visit from the secret service after she told a large, adoring group of women at the Women’s March in DC, that she’d like to blow up the White House.  And then there’s “comedian” Kathy Griffin, who saw her career literally blow up after making an ISIS style video holding up a decapitated and bloodied head of President Trump.  Is Hollywood’s rapidly declining appeal really so surprising to most Americans who are 100% FED UP with their hate for middle-America?  As Hollywood wraps up the all-important summer box-office season this Labor Day weekend, a sobering reality has gripped the industry.  The number of tickets sold in the United States and Canada this summer is projected to fall to the lowest level in a quarter-century.  The results have put the squeeze on the nation’s top theater chains, whose stocks have taken a drubbing. AMC Theatres Chief Executive Adam Aron this month called his company’s most recent quarter “simply a bust.”  Such blunt language reflects some worrisome trends. Domestic box-office revenue is expected to total $3.78 billion for the first weekend of May through Labor Day — a key period that generates about 40% of domestic ticket sales — down nearly 16% from the same period last year, according to comScore. That’s an even worse decline than the 10% drop some studio executives predicted before the summer began. –LA Times  Breitbart – Even before this catastrophic Labor Day weekend is factored in (more on this below), the domestic 2017 box office is in hideous shape. This year is –6.3% behind 2016 and continues to fall behind 2015, 2013, and 2012.  If you figure in inflation, those numbers are even worse. For example, in 2012 the average ticket cost $7.96. Today it is almost a full dollar more at $8.89. Yeah, things are that bad and will look even worse on Tuesday.  With no apparent faith in their own product, this is the first Labor Day in 25 years where a new title has not been released on more than 1,000 screens. Over this weekend last year, the box office hauled in nearly $130 million. This year will do about a third of that.  Summer attendance is at a 25-year low.  The summer box office is down a whopping –16% compared to 2016.  Can a handful of titles — It, Kingsman 2, Bladerunner 2, Thor 3, Justice League, Star Wars 8 — save an entire year? Doubtful. Pull out of a dive? Maybe. Still, we are talking about only six big titles over four months, which is about on par with last year’s Passengers, Rogue One, Doctor Strange, Fantastic Beasts, Inferno, Sully, and Magnificent Seven.",https://100percentfedup.com/message-hollywood-goes-viral/
2145,10/17/17,,12,31,2099,JOHN MCCAIN EXPLODES ON YOUNG FOX REPORTER: Calls Him 'Dumb' And 'Stupid' For Asking If His Votes Are Protest of Trump  ,"WOW! The truth hurts! John McCain becomes a total ass when asked by Fox reporter Peter Doocy if his votes are a protest of President Trump:    IN CASE TYOU DIDN’T CATCH THAT:  Senator John McCain: “Why would you say something that stupid? Why would you ask something that dumb? Huh? My job as a United States senator as a senator from Arizona which I was just reelected to. You think that I would somehow behave in a way that I would block everything just because of some personal disagreement? That’s a dumb question.”        *          Doocy’s question really isn’t too far off. We could begin with McCain’s shocking vote for keeping Obamacare. Since then, the war of words between President Trump and McCain has only gotten more heated.  OUR LATEST ON THE FEUD BETWEEN THE SENATOR AND THE PRESIDENT:  President Trump hit back at Senator John McCain in a pointed statement that should make it clear that Trump isn’t playing around with globalist RINO McCain anymore. You can’t blame Trump because McCain just keeps nipping at his heels with swipes trying to undermine Trump’s policies. RINO McCain famously demolished the latest effort to repeal and replace Obamacare in a dramatic show during the vote. McCain came onto the floor at the end of the Senate vote and voted no with a dramatic thumbs down motion.  McCain has been at odds with Trump since Trump questioned McCains status as a war hero. It seems McCain has had it out for Trump ever since.  Another bombshell on the McCain/Trump feud hypothesizes that the Trump Dossier could have come from McCain.  The latest slam to Trump happened just last night during a speech McCain gave. McCain called out Trump’s nationalism but it didn’t take long for Trump to respond:  President Donald Trump on Tuesday issued a warning shot after Republican Sen. John McCain questioned “half-baked, spurious nationalism” in America’s foreign policy.  Trump said in a radio interview with WMAL in Washington that “people have to be careful because at some point I fight back.” The president added “I’m being very, very nice but at some point I fight back and it won’t be pretty.”  MANY QUESTIONS RAISED ON MCCAIN’S STORY OF CAPTIVITY  Trump could be referring to new questions about McCain’s captivity in Vietnam. McCain has always been touted as a war hero for decades but many of the men who served when he did have raised questions about McCain.  McCain, a former Navy pilot who spent 5½ years in a Vietnam prisoner of war camp and is battling brain cancer, offered a simple response to Trump: “I have faced tougher adversaries.”  In Philadelphia on Monday night, the six-term Republican senator from Arizona received an award for a lifetime of service and sacrifice to the country. In addition to recalling his more than two decades of military service and his imprisonment during the war, McCain took a moment to go a step further than the night’s other speakers, who lamented what many described as a fractured political climate.  MCCAIN’S GLOBALIST WORD SALAD:  “To abandon the ideals we have advanced around the globe, to refuse the obligations of international leadership for the sake of some half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems,” he said, “is as unpatriotic as an attachment to any other tired dogma of the past that Americans consigned to the ash heap of history.”  He continued: “We live in a land made of ideals, not blood and soil.”  Former Vice President Joe Biden presented McCain with the Liberty Medal. Though members of opposing parties, the two men worked together during their time in the Senate. Former President Barack Obama, who defeated McCain in his bid for the presidency in 2008, congratulated the senator on the award in a tweet Monday night.  “I’m grateful to @SenJohnMcCain for his lifetime of service to our country.

2176,10/19/17,,12,31,2099,Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar explained what happens when humongous stars die,"All things die, even stars. When stars run out of hydrogen — the fuel that sustains the nuclear fusion reactors at their cores — they become unstable and collapse in on themselves. But not all stars collapse in the same way. Some of the most massive ones explode into a supernova and then collapse down into neutron stars, or black holes. We know this because of the work of astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, who would be 107 Thursday and is honored with a Google Doodle.  Chandrasekhar — an Indian-born scientist who spent 50 years at the University of Chicago — is most famous for coming up with the theory that explains the death of the universe’s most massive stars.  Before Chandrasekhar, scientists assumed that all stars collapsed into white dwarfs when they died. He determined this isn’t so.  On a long sea voyage from India to England in 1930 at the age of 19, he worked it out. According to the science of quantum mechanics, there are forces within the very atoms of the white dwarf star that counteract the force of gravity. Chandrasekhar determined this force would be overwhelmed if the star were massive enough.  He determined that any star remnants 1.4 times more massive than our sun would be too massive to form a stable white dwarf. After the limit, the force of gravity would cause the white dwarf to collapse.  “This discovery is basic to much of modern astrophysics, since it shows that stars much more massive than the Sun must either explode or form black holes,” NASA explains.  (For a more technical description of Chandrasekhar’s methodology, check out this great PBS story.)  This figure — 1.4 times the mass of our sun — is now known as the “Chandrasekhar limit,” and it’s key to understanding the evolution of stars in our universe. Beyond this limit, stars at the end of their lives either explode into a supernova or explode and then collapse into a neutron star or even a black hole.  Neutron stars are some of the weirdest objects in the universe. They’re small — just 15 or so miles across — but contain a mass equal to the sun. A teaspoon of neutron star weighs around 10 million tons. They’re so dense that the only things that can exist inside of them are neutrons, which are protons and electrons fused together. (The LIGO gravitational wave observatory just witnessed two of them crashing into each other. Subsequent observations showed that this collision actually contained the right energy and conditions to create heavy elements like gold and platinum.)  At the time of his discovery in the 1930s, Chandrasekhar didn’t know what, exactly, these massive stars would turn into once they spent all their fuel.  Initially, his idea was met with ridicule.  Sir Arthur Eddington, a physicist whose experimental work was key in proving Einstein’s theory of general relativity, openly mocked Chandrasekhar’s theory at a meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1935.  ""The star has to go on radiating and radiating and contracting and contracting until, I suppose, it gets to a few kilometers' radius, when gravity becomes strong enough to hold the radiation and the star can at last have peace,"" Eddington said, inadvertently describing the very thing Chandrasekhar’s limit would explain: the creation of black holes. “I think there should be a law of Nature to prevent a star from behaving in this absurd way!” he added. (There isn’t.)  This incident was so embarrassing for the young Chandrasekhar that he almost quit the field, the New York Times explains. (Chandrasekhar and Eddington would eventually make amends.)  Of course, scientists would go on to find more and more evidence of the existence of black holes and neutron stars. And for his work, Chandrasekhar won half of the 1983 Nobel Prize in physics. His theory represents one of the very early, important steps in our understanding of black holes and neutron stars.  And today his name adorns one of NASA’s prized space telescopes: The Chandra X-ray Observatory, whose data has contributed to the most spectacular images we have of dying stars exploding into supernovas.  This is the Crab Nebula, the result of a supernova explosion 4,500 light-years away from Earth.  Chandrasekhar was a prolific writer — he published more than a dozen textbooks on a range of topics in physics — and a devoted teacher (having once regularly driven a 100-mile round trip just to teach a class with two students), the University of Chicago explains. He was also the editor of the prestigious Astrophysical Journal for two decades. He passed away in 1995.  When he accepted the Nobel Prize in 1983, Chandrasekhar chose to read aloud a poem he had memorized from his youth in India. It was by Rabindranath Tagore, an Indian who won the Nobel prize for literature in 1913.

2181,11/15/17,,12,31,2099,There’s a highly successful treatment for opioid addiction. But stigma is holding it back.,"“I’m sick of going to funerals.”  If you ask Jordan Hansen why he changed his mind on medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction, this is the bottom line.  Several years ago, Hansen was against the form of treatment. If asked back then what he thought about it, he would have told you that it’s ineffective — and even harmful — for drug users. Like other critics, to Hansen, medication-assisted treatment was nothing more than substituting one drug (say, heroin) with another (methadone).  Today, not only does Hansen think this form of treatment is effective, but he readily argues — as the scientific evidence overwhelmingly shows — that it’s the best form of treatment for opioid addiction. He believes this so strongly, in fact, that he now often leads training sessions for medication-assisted treatment across the country.  “It almost hurts to say it out loud now, but it’s the truth,” Hansen told me, describing his previous beliefs. “I was kind of absorbing the collective fear and ignorance from the culture at large within the recovery community.”  Hansen is far from alone. Over the past few years, America’s harrowing opioid epidemic — now the deadliest drug overdose crisis in the country’s history — has led to a lot of rethinking about how to deal with addiction. For addiction treatment providers, that’s led to new debates about the merits of the abstinence-only model — many of which essentially consider addiction a failure of willpower — so long supported in the US.  Related How to stop the deadliest drug overdose crisis in American history  The Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation, which Hansen works for, exemplifies the debate. As one of the top drug treatment providers in the country, it used to subscribe almost exclusively to the abstinence-only model, based on an interpretation of the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous popularized in American addiction treatment in the past several decades. But in 2012, Hazelden announced a big switch: It would provide medication-assisted treatment.  “This is a huge shift for our culture and organization,” Marvin Seppala, chief medical officer of Hazelden, said at the time. “We believe it’s the responsible thing to do.”  From the outside, this might seem like a bizarre debate: Okay, so addiction treatment providers are supporting a form of treatment that has a lot of evidence behind it. So what?  But the growing embrace of medication-assisted treatment is demonstrative of how the opioid epidemic is forcing the country to take another look at its inadequate drug treatment system. With so many people dying from drug overdoses — tens of thousands a year — and hundreds of thousands more expected to die in the next decade, America is finally considering how its response to addiction can be better rooted in science instead of the moralistic stigmatization that’s existed for so long.  The problem is that the moralistic stigmatization is still fairly entrenched in how the US thinks about addiction. But the embrace of medication-assisted treatment shows that may be changing — and America may be finally looking at addiction as a medical condition instead of a moral failure.  The research is clear: Medication-assisted treatment works  One of the reasons opioid addiction is so powerful is that users feel like they must keep using the drugs in order to stave off withdrawal. Once a person’s body grows used to opioids but doesn’t get enough of the drugs to satisfy what it’s used to, withdrawal can pop up, causing, among other symptoms, severe nausea and full-body aches. So to avoid suffering through it, drug users often seek out drugs like heroin and opioid painkillers — not necessarily to get a euphoric high, but to feel normal and avoid withdrawal. (In the heroin world, this is often referred to as “getting straight.”)  Medications like methadone and buprenorphine (also known as Suboxone) can stop this cycle. Since they are opioids themselves, they can fulfill a person’s cravings and stop withdrawal symptoms. The key is that they do this in a safe medical setting, and when taken as prescribed do not produce the euphoric high that opioids do when they are misused. By doing this, an opioid user significantly reduces the risk of relapse, since he doesn’t have to worry about avoiding withdrawal anymore. Users can take this for the rest of their lives, or in some cases, doses may be reduced; it varies from patient to patient.  The research backs this up: Various studies, including systematic reviews of the research, have found that medication-assisted treatment can cut the all-cause mortality rate among addiction patients by half or more. Just imagine if a medication came out for any other disease — and, yes, health experts consider addiction a disease — that cuts mortality by half; it would be a momentous discovery.  “That is shown repeatedly,” Maia Szalavitz, a longtime addiction journalist and author of Unbroken Brain: A Revolutionary New Way of Understanding Addiction, told me. “There’s so much data from so many different places that if you add methadone or Suboxone in, deaths go down, and if you take it away, deaths go up.”  That’s why the biggest public health organizations — including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and the World Health Organization — all acknowledge medication-assisted treatment’s medical value. And experts often describe it as “the gold standard” for opioid addiction care.  The data is what drove Hansen’s change in perspective. “If I wanted to view myself as an ethical practitioner and doing the best that I could for the people I served, I needed to make this change based on the overwhelming evidence,” he said. “And I needed to separate that from my personal recovery experience.”  Medication-assisted treatment is different from traditional forms of dealing with addiction in America, which tend to demand abstinence. The standards in this field are 12-step programs, which combine spiritual and moralistic ideals into a support group for people suffering from addiction. While some 12-step programs allow medication-assisted treatment, others prohibit it as part of their demand for total abstinence. The research shows this is a particularly bad idea for opioids, for which medications are considered the standard of care.  There are different kinds of medications for opioids, which will work better or worse depending on a patient’s circumstances. Methadone, for example, is only administered in a clinic, typically one to four times a day — but that means patients will have to make the trip to a clinic on a fairly regular basis. Buprenorphine is a take-home drug that’s taken once or twice a day, but the at-home access also means it might be easier to misuse and divert to the black market.  One rising medication, known as extended-release naltrexone or its brand name Vivitrol, isn’t an opioid — making it less prone to misuse — and only needs to be injected once a month. But it also requires full detoxification to use (usually three to 10 days of no opioid use), while buprenorphine only requires a partial detoxification process (usually 12 hours to two days). And instead of preventing withdrawal — indeed, the detox process requires going through withdrawal — it blocks the effects of opioids up to certain doses, making it much harder to get high or overdose on the drugs.  The first US-based study comparing naltrexone and buprenorphine found that once people get on either, they are similarly effective. But that comes with a major caveat: It was much harder to get people started on naltrexone than buprenorphine because naltrexone requires a detox period. So buprenorphine is, on average, more accessible and effective than naltrexone — although results can vary from individual to individual.  One catch is that even these medications, though the best forms of opioid addiction treatment, do not work for as much as 40 percent of opioid users. Some patients may prefer not to take any medications because they see any drug use whatsoever as getting in the way of their recovery, in which case total abstinence may be the right answer for them. Others may not respond well physically to the medications, or the medications may for whatever reason fail to keep them from misusing drugs.  This isn’t atypical in medicine. What works for some people, even the majority, isn’t always going to work for everyone. So these are really first-line treatments, but in some cases patients may need alternative therapies if medication-assisted treatment doesn’t work. (That might even involve prescription heroin — which, while it’s perhaps counterintuitive, the research shows it works to mitigate the problems of addiction when provided in tightly controlled, supervised medical settings.)  Medication can also be paired with other kinds of treatment to better results. It can be used in tandem with cognitive behavioral therapy or similar approaches, which teach drug users how to deal with problems or settings that can lead to relapse. All of that can also be paired with 12-step programs like AA and NA or other support groups in which people work together and hold each other accountable in the fight against addiction. It all varies from patient to patient.  Why medication-assisted treatment is not just replacing one drug with another  The main criticism of medication-assisted treatment is that it’s merely replacing one drug with another. Former Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price echoed this criticism, saying, “If we’re just substituting one opioid for another, we’re not moving the dial much. Folks need to be cured so they can be productive members of society and realize their dreams.” (A spokesperson for Price later walked back the statement, saying Price supports all kinds of treatment.)  On its face, this argument is true. Medication-assisted treatment is replacing one drug, whether it’s opioid painkillers or heroin, with another, such as methadone or buprenorphine.  But this isn’t by itself a bad thing.  Under the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, it’s not enough for someone to be using or even physically dependent on drugs to qualify for a substance use disorder, the technical name for addiction. After all, most US adults use drugs — some every day or multiple times a day — without any problems whatsoever. Just think about that next time you sip a beer, glass of wine, coffee, tea, or any other beverage with alcohol or caffeine in it, or any time you use a drug to treat a medical condition.  The qualification for a substance use disorder is that someone is using drugs in a dangerous or risky manner. So someone with an opioid use disorder would not just be using opioids but potentially using these drugs in a way that puts him or others in danger — perhaps by feeling the need to commit crimes to obtain the drugs or using the drugs so much that he puts himself at risk of overdose and inhibits his day-to-day functioning. Basically, the drug use has to hinder someone from being a healthy, functioning member of society to qualify as addiction.  The key with medication-assisted treatment is that while it does involve continued drug use, it turns that drug use into a much safer habit. So instead of stealing to get heroin or using painkillers so much that he puts his life at risk, a patient on medication-assisted treatment can simply use methadone or buprenorphine to meet his physical cravings and otherwise go about his day — going to school, work, or any other obligations.  Yet this myth of the dangers of medication-assisted treatment remains prevalent — to deadly results.  In 2013, Judge Frank Gulotta Jr. in New York ordered an opioid user arrested for drugs, Robert Lepolszki, off methadone treatment, which he began after his arrest. In January 2014, Lepolszki died of a drug overdose at 28 years old — a direct result, Lepolszki’s parents say, of failing to get the medicine he needed. In his defense, Gulotta has continued to argue that methadone programs “are crutches — they are substitutes for drugs and drug cravings without enabling the participant to actually rid him or herself of the addiction.”  This is just one case, but it shows the real risk of denying opioid users medication: It can literally get them killed by depriving them of lifesaving medical care.  The myth is also a big reason why there are still restrictions on medication-assisted treatment. For example, the federal government still caps how many patients doctors can prescribe buprenorphine to, with strict rules about raising the cap. This limits how accessible the treatment is. A HuffPost analysis found that even if every doctor who can prescribe buprenorphine did so at the maximum rate in 2012, more than half of Americans with opioid use disorders could not get the medication.  That’s on top of barriers to addiction treatment in general. According to a 2016 report by the surgeon general, just 10 percent of Americans with a drug use disorder obtain specialty treatment. The report attributed the low rate to severe shortages in the supply of care — which can lead to waiting periods of weeks or even months.  The medications used in treatment do carry some risks  None of this is to say that the medications used in these treatments are without any problems whatsoever.  Methadone is tied to some misuse and thousands of deadly overdoses a year — although mostly when it’s used for pain, not addiction, treatment, because it’s more regulated in addiction care.  Buprenorphine is safer in that, unlike common painkillers, heroin, and methadone, its effect has a ceiling — meaning it has no significant effect after a certain dose level. But it’s still possible to misuse, particularly for people with lower tolerance levels. And there are some reports of buprenorphine mills, where patients can get buprenorphine for misuse from unscrupulous doctors — similar to how pill mills popped up during the beginning of the opioid epidemic and provided patients easy access to painkillers.  Naltrexone, meanwhile, can heighten the risk of overdose and death in case of full relapse. Overdose and death are risks in any case of relapse, but they’re particularly acute for naltrexone because it requires a full detox process that eliminates prior tolerance. (Although this would typically require someone to stop taking naltrexone, since otherwise it blocks the effects of opioids up to certain doses.)  But when taken as prescribed, the medications are broadly safe and effective for addiction treatment. For regulators, it’s a matter of making sure the drugs aren’t diverted into misuse, while also providing good access to people who genuinely need them.  The fight over medication-assisted treatment is really about how we see addiction  Behind the arguments about medication-assisted treatment is a simple reality of how Americans view addiction: Many still don’t see it, as public health officials and experts do, as a disease.  With other diseases, there is no question that medication can be a legitimate answer. That medication is not viewed as a proper answer by many to addiction shows that people believe addiction is unique in some way — particularly, they view addiction as at least partly a moral failing instead of just a disease.  I get emails all the time to this effect. Here, for example, is a fairly representative reader message: “Darwin’s Theory says ‘survival of the fittest.’ Let these lost souls pay the price of their criminal choices and criminal actions. Society does not owe them multiple medical resuscitations from their own bad judgment, criminal activity, and self-inflicted wounds.”  This contradicts what addiction experts broadly agree on. As Stanford psychiatrist and Drug Dealer, MD author Anna Lembke put it, “If you see somebody who continues to use despite their lives being totally destroyed — losing their jobs, losing loved ones, ending up in jail — nobody would choose that. Nobody anywhere would ever choose that life. So clearly it is beyond this individual’s control on some level.”  Many Americans may understand this with, say, depression and anxiety. We know that people with these types of mental health problems are not in full control of their thoughts and emotions. But many don’t realize that addiction functions in a similar way — only that the thoughts and emotions drive someone to seek out drugs at just about any cost.  Some of the sentiment against medications, as Hansen can testify, is propagated by people suffering from addiction. Some of them believe that any drug use, even to treat addiction, goes against the goal of full sobriety. They may believe that if they got sober without medications, perhaps others should too. Many of them also don’t trust the health care system: If they got addicted to drugs because a doctor prescribed them opioid painkillers, they have a good reason to distrust doctors who are now trying to get them to take another medication — this time for their addiction.  The opioid epidemic, however, has gotten a lot of people in the addiction recovery world to reconsider their past beliefs. Funeral after funeral and awful statistic after awful statistic, there is a sense that there has to be a better way — and by looking at the evidence, many have come to support medication-assisted treatment.  “I remember sitting there,” Hansen said, speaking to his experience at a funeral, as a mother sang her dead son a lullaby, “thinking that we have to do better.”",https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/7/20/15937896/medication-assisted-treatment-methadone-buprenorphine-naltrexone
