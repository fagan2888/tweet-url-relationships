60,8/30/17,,12,31,2099,Tax reform now -- failure to act could mean minority status for GOP in 2019,"Republicans in Congress are at a make or break moment and everyone knows it. Moments like these don’t come around very often in politics. President Donald Trump, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell all agree that the time has come to seize on real and lasting tax reform, which will lead to job creation and fuel our economic engine for future generations. Republicans, as well as any Trump-state Democrats seeking to help hardworking American taxpayers with this pro-growth legislation, need to come together. We must get a robust tax reform bill signed into law this year.  The American people know that Republicans control the White House and both Houses of Congress, and looking at the first six months of the 115th Congress have little to show for it. If Congress doesn’t act, it will appear that the campaign rhetoric was just that – all talk. We have a President of the United States asking Congress to send a tax reform package to his desk. Year after year during the Obama Administration, Republican leaders in Congress said “just wait until we have a Republican president. Then things will be different.” McConnell and Ryan must produce a historic tax reform package that members of their respective caucuses can get behind. Inaction on tax reform could very well mean minority status in 2019. Make no mistake about it; the American people expect action. It’s true that Democrats are being obstructionists, but folks around the country want Republicans to get the job done and keep their promise.  When overly burdensome taxes and regulations are cut for American entrepreneurs, American businesses, and American workers, amazing things happen.  The American people believe all Republicans are in agreement that tax reform is critical. That’s why American families and job creators want to know when it’s going to happen and so does President Trump. Republicans on Capitol Hill from across the political spectrum, from the most moderate to the most conservative, all acknowledge that tax reform and tax relief were key campaign promises in 2016 that helped catapult them to victory and majority status in both chambers of Congress.  Republicans also agree on the importance of tax reform and tax cuts when it comes to growing the economy. President Trump’s uplifting economic message paved the way for his victories in states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Upon taking office, the President’s economic optimism and executive orders on deregulation have caused the Dow Jones industrial average to skyrocket to historic highs, paved the way to one million new jobs created in six months and 2.6 percent growth in the second quarter, and made the unemployment rate shrink to its lowest level since 2001. But job creators in businesses large and small are expecting tax reform from Congress in 2017 so they can plan for the future.  When President Ronald Reagan’s economic recovery act was signed into law in 1981, it created decades of unprecedented economic growth. It’s a recent roadmap to success that must be learned from. When overly burdensome taxes and regulations are cut for American entrepreneurs, American businesses, and American workers, amazing things happen. It’s called American Exceptionalism and President Reagan knew that better than anyone. Republican Senators from Ted Cruz and Mike Lee to Susan Collins and John McCain know that too. It’s time for these leaders to come together and deliver on much-deserved tax reform and tax relief.  Failure is not an option. The economy is on the launch pad ready to fire its engines at full capacity. America just needs the tax package signed into law to achieve historic levels of growth. Job creators are waiting for Congress to press the ignition button. It’s time for them to act.",http://www.foxnews.com//opinion/2017/08/30/tax-reform-now-failure-to-act-could-mean-minority-status-for-gop-in-2019.html
142,8/31/17,,12,31,2099,Global stocks advance ahead of US data run,"This Oct. 4, 2014, file photo, shows the facade of the New York Stock Exchange. U.S. stocks are quiet early Wednesday, Aug. 30, 2017, as technology companies rise while energy companies continue to fall as investors sort through the ongoing damage caused by Harvey. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)  LONDON (AP) — Upbeat economic figures from around the world helped shore up global stock markets on Thursday ahead of a raft of U.S. data that could determine the scale of upcoming rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.  KEEPING SCORE: In Europe, Germany’s DAX rose 0.6 percent to 12,072 while Britain’s FTSE 100 advanced 0.7 percent to 7,419. The CAC 40 in France was 0.7 percent higher too at 5,091. U.S. stocks were poised for a steady opening with Dow futures and the broader S&P 500 futures up 0.2 percent.  US DATA: Following jitters at the start of the week over North Korea’s firing of a missile over Japan, the mood has improved somewhat with most investors monitoring a raft of economic data that culminates with Friday’s U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for August. That could help shape market expectations over the pace of interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.  ANALYST TAKE: “Of course, Friday’s jobs report is widely regarding as the most important data release each month due to the insight it offers on hiring, wages and therefore potential future inflation pressures,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA. “Today’s data though is arguably equally important, if not more so at the moment, as it contains the latest inflation numbers — as per the Fed’s preferred measure — as well as income and spending figures.”  EUROZONE INFLATION: Inflation across the 19-country eurozone struck a four-month high of 1.5 percent in the year to August largely because of higher energy costs, in a development that’s unlikely to alter expectations that the European Central Bank will play it safe at next week’s policy meeting. The increase was anticipated in financial markets, but inflation remains below the European Central Bank’s goal of just below 2 percent.  CHINA MANUFACTURING: An official gauge of Chinese factory activity improved for a 13th straight month in August. The preliminary version of the purchasing managers’ index from the China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing and the National Bureau of Statistics rose to 51.7 from July’s 51.4 on a 100-point scale on which numbers above 50 show activity expanding. An index of new orders rose to 53.1 from July’s 52.8.  ASIA’S DAY: The Shanghai Composite Index was unchanged at 3,360.81 while Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.7 percent to 19,646.24. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng shed 0.4 percent to 27,970.30 and Seoul’s Kospi lost 0.4 percent to 2,363.19. Sydney’s S&P-ASX 200 advanced 0.8 percent to 5,714.50.  ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude rose 28 cents to $46.24 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange while Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 35 cents to trade at $51.08 in London.  CURRENCIES: The euro was down 0.4 percent at $1.1837 while the dollar rose 0.3 percent to 110.55 yen.","https://www.apnews.com//80a5e651466740b5be62fdabb4a2f516/Asian-stocks-mixed-after-China-factories,-Wall-Street-gains"
191,8/31/17,,12,31,2099,US consumer spending up 0.3 percent in July,"Consumer spending increased in July at the fastest pace in three months, while incomes grew by the largest amount since February, both encouraging signs for future economic growth.  Consumer spending rose 0.3 percent in July, the best showing since April, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. It followed 0.2 percent advances in both May and June. Incomes in June grew 0.4 percent, the best showing since February. The strength came from a strong 0.5 percent rise in wages and salaries, reflecting the healthy 209,000 gain in employment in July.  Economists said the report showed that Americans are feeling confident enough to boost their spending, which accounts for 70 percent of the country's economic activity.  ""Consumer spending looks rock solid,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. ""The consumer continues to do the heavy lifting when it comes to economic growth as corporations hold back investment plans until they see what tax reform proposals make it through Congress.""  Rupkey said he was expecting consumer spending to support overall economic growth of around 2.8 percent in the current July-September quarter.  A key inflation gauge favored by the Federal Reserve posted a tiny 0.1 percent increase in July. Over the past 12 months, it is up just 1.4 percent, still well below the Fed's 2 percent target.  Inflation has been running below the Fed's target for five years and has fallen farther from the 2 percent mark since early this year. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has blamed the slowdown on temporary factors, but minutes of the Fed's July meeting showed a growing concern that the slowdown in price increases might reflect developments that are more long-lasting.  The Fed raised a key interest rate in March and June of this year and signaled that it expected to hike rates one more time in 2017. The Fed next meets in September. But private economists believe the central bank will hold off on any further hikes until they see signs that inflation has resumed rising.  Thursday's spending report showed a strong 0.6 percent increase in purchases of durable goods such as autos and a solid 0.5 percent rise in demand for non-durable goods such as food and clothing. Spending on services such as utilities and doctor's visits rose 0.2 percent.  The government reported Wednesday that the overall economy, as measured by the gross domestic product, grew at a solid 3 percent rate in the April-June quarter, the best quarterly growth rate in two years. The government had initially reported GDP growth at a slower 2.6 rate in the second quarter but that figure was revised higher in large part because of a stronger gain in consumer spending.  The report on incomes and spending showed that the saving rate in July slipped to 3.5 percent of after-tax income, the lowest level since it stood at 3.2 percent last December.",http://www.foxnews.com//us/2017/08/31/us-consumer-spending-up-0-3-percent-in-july.html
196,8/31/17,,12,31,2099,Fox host: Democrats are afraid of tax reform because the economy will grow so much that they won’t win any elections,"KELLYANNE CONWAY: The man who works behind me here, President Trump, he's at his desk, pen in hand, ready to sign into law repeal and replacing Obamacare. He hasn't given up on that because he knows 29 million Americans don't have health insurance. He knows that Obamacare made many of their situations worse for many of them who were lied to about keeping their plans and doctors. They are without care. He stands ready to do fundamental tax reform, and he went yesterday, before Congress even gets back into session from their very long vacation where they got an earful from constituents for not getting things done. He's ready.  BRIAN KILMEADE (CO-HOST): Yeah, I have no idea why they keep going on vacation. It is just, it's criminal. They have to work for a living.  CONWAY: It's good work if you can get it.  KILMEADE: Yeah. This is basically -- what the president's doing, a lot of people wanted him to do for health care, absent [House Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell [(R-KY)]. He's going to go outline his plan, and he's going to reportedly be active in doing it. And he gave some basics. He said I'm going to have three income tax brackets instead of seven. I'm going to look to get a 15 percent corporate tax cut, I'm going to repeal the estate tax, no alternative minimum tax. Having said that, I'm thinking, OK, that's a good framework, I wonder how it's going to be hashed out, details to come. It didn't stop [House Minority Leader] Nancy Pelosi [(D-CA)] from coming out immediately and said, ""Instead of offering the American people a plan for real job-creating tax reform, President Trump is pushing billionaires-first trickle-down tax scheme that hands out massive tax cuts to the wealthiest, at the expensive of American families."" I sense she is against something she doesn't even been presented with yet. I mean, that is just the wrong attitude. That's the anti what we're seeing in Texas. Do you think there might be on some level a fear among Democrats that if tax reform is passed for America, the economy will grow at such a rate it will be impossible for them to win an election?  CONWAY: You hit it correctly. That's what I see. And this is what happened in the past when Ronald Reagan gave us fundamental tax reform. He was more popular and helped his vice president get a third term, get his third term, frankly. But what is Nancy Pelosi's plan? She's talking about Donald Trump's plan for tax reform. What is her plan?",https://www.mediamatters.org/video/2017/08/31/fox-host-democrats-are-afraid-tax-reform-because-economy-will-grow-so-much-they-won-t-win-any/217814
695,9/10/17,,12,31,2099,Insider Q&A: Higher pay needed to support stronger growth,"Sluggish pay raises have been an Achilles' heel for American workers since the Great Recession ended more than eight years ago — and a major headwind for faster economic growth.  As a result, many people are spending less than they otherwise would. That trend, in turn, contributes to slower overall growth in the U.S. economy, because consumers account for roughly 70 percent of economic activity.  Dan North, chief economist for Euler Hermes North America, part of the world's oldest and largest credit insurance company, spoke recently with The Associated Press about how income after taxes — what analysts call disposable personal income — isn't keeping pace with consumer spending growth.  ___  Q: What are the factors driving U.S. economic growth right now?  A: We think for the entire year we're likely to see GDP growth of around 2 percent. But consumers have a few headwinds. First of all, real disposable personal income growth is increasing at just 1.3 percent. That's very slow. Consumer spending is increasing at a faster rate. If you look at personal consumption expenditures, that's rising at 2.7 percent. As a result, consumers have to dip into their flow of savings to pay for items.  Without income growth, it's hard for consumption growth to continue. The big story is we don't have enough income. Consumer confidence has soared since the election. But consumers often say one thing and do another. To spend, you need the willingness and ability. Consumers are saying they have the willingness, so it would seem. But that's not enough. You've got to have the ability to spend, too.  Q: What would unlock stronger income growth?  A: The low unemployment rate doesn't tell the whole story. Our participation rate — the share of people with jobs or looking for work — is quite low as well. We need more people at work. And we need those people to be earning higher wages.  You might think that the low unemployment rate would lead to higher wage growth, but it hasn't. One reason is that productivity has been very weak. When you have weak productivity, you have weak wage growth.  Q: What role to baby boomers and millennials play in all of this?  A: This demographics of the aging workforce is really tough. What's happening is we have baby boomers who are leaving the workforce at a rate of 10,000 every day. They probably will keep doing that for the next 12 years or so. We can't replace them fast enough, and employers can't find the right people with the right skills to fill those jobs.  One way to address that is to have more skilled legal immigration. President Trump took a step in the right way with a proposal to focus on bringing in more skilled immigrants. But then then he took a step backward by planning to cut down the number immigrants being admitted.  Q: Can businesses get enough access to credit?  A: Small and medium businesses have a desire to expand, but there is still caution on pulling the trigger. So there is a lack of loan demand. You see the numbers where the growth in commercial loans may not be strong, but you look at the banker survey and say, well, a lot of businesses aren't really interested in getting credit yet. That's kind of hampering the expansion of credit.  ___  Answers are edited for length and clarity.",http://www.foxnews.com//us/2017/09/10/insider-q-higher-pay-needed-to-support-stronger-growth.html
811,9/12/17,,12,31,2099,Median U.S. Household Income Up for 2nd Straight Year,"The good news is that income inequality, by some measures, is no longer increasing.  The details of the report help to explain the reasons. Household incomes increased because more people were working, and the gains in employment have been concentrated among workers with less education, driving income gains on the lower rungs of the economic ladder.  “Households are doing better because more people are working and more people are working full time,” said Jed Kolko, chief economist at the jobs site Indeed.com.  But the increases in household income also reflected investment gains. The share of income that came from sources other than wages increased markedly last year, to 21.8 percent, from 21.1 percent in 2015. That kind of income flows mostly to households on the upper rungs of the ladder.  Income inequality is at a very high level by historical standards. Some economists see evidence that the uneven distribution of income and wealth is an impediment to economic growth.  It also means the lives of Americans are increasingly different, depending on their economic fortunes. For example, mortality rates are climbing for middle-aged white Americans with no more than a high school education, a trend that the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, described this year as “very shocking.”  The Fed has curtailed its efforts to stimulate economic growth, concluding that monetary policy has done what it can. The Fed is expected to announce next week, after a meeting of its policy-making committee, that it will begin to reduce its bond holdings, a final legacy of its stimulus campaign.  While the distribution of income didn’t change last year, the rising tide lifted more people from poverty. The Census Bureau reported that 12.7 percent of households lived in poverty in 2016, representing a total of 40.6 million people. That was down from 13.5 percent of households and 43.1 million people in 2015. But the rate remains slightly higher than the 12.5 percent rate in 2007, before the recession, and significantly higher than the 11.3 percent rate in 2000.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/business/economy/income-rebound-recession.html
822,9/12/17,,12,31,2099,"The new iPhone X, explained","At its debut Apple Park public event today, Apple unveiled a host of new products including the iPhone 8, iPhone 8S, Apple TV 4K, and third-edition Apple Watch.  But the most exciting product on the list is the new iPhone X (the name is a sly nod to the tenth anniversary of the iPhone as well as to the fact that everyone knows it’s the coolest letter in the alphabet), the highest-end phone in Apple’s lineup priced at an eye-popping starting point of $999.  This represents a change in strategy, on a number of levels, from the basic formula that Apple has used for its mobile phone business. And Apple’s mobile phone business is not just the most successful mobile phone business in the world, it’s essentially the most successful business of any kind in the world — so any change in approach is noteworthy. Why mess with success?  The iPhone’s success paradox  Not every successful product is “the best” product in its category.  The point of Ikea furniture or a Toyota Camry isn’t to be the greatest, most high-end offering in the realm of houseware or sedans, the point is to meet a practical consumer need at an attractive price. There are Ferraris and Porsches in the marketplace, too, but making “the best” car isn’t necessarily a more successful business strategy than making a good enough car at a reasonable price.  But the iPhone is different. From the day it was first introduced, it was positioned in the market as the best phone in the world. But it’s also become the best-selling phone in the world. And like any marquee smartphone, it needs to be updated and upgraded every year.  This gives Apple a big problem. Year after year, any new ideas they want to bring to the iPhone need to be capable of being manufacturing on a massive scale in a relatively compressed timeline. That’s hard to do and, in practice, it means that certain things simply can’t be done. And that means risking the iPhone’s quality leadership.  In concrete terms, low-power OLED screens are spreading in the Android world and they provide real user benefits in terms of increased battery life and the ability to take the display edge-to-edge. But nobody has yet figured out how to manufacture really high-quality OLED screens at the volume Apple needs to meet the consumer demand for iPhones.  The solution is the iPhone X. It’s essentially a Lexus to the iPhone’s Toyota — pairing the OLED screen with a few other high-end touches while containing substantially the same guts and commanding a premium price. Most people probably won’t want to shell out a thousand bucks or more for a smartphone, but that’s fine because Apple couldn’t make this phone in high volume anyway. The outer frontiers of quality require scarcity, and high prices turn scarcity into profits.  Apple risks losing the Coca-Cola factor  Andy Warhol once said that “what’s great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest.” He took as his example Coca Cola.  “You know that the president drinks Coca Cola, Liz Taylor drinks Coca Cola, and just think, you can drink Coca Cola, too,” he said. “A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking. All the Cokes are the same and all the Cokes are good. Liz Taylor knows it, the president knows it, the bum knows it, and you know it.”  The iPhone isn’t exactly priced to appeal to the poorest people in the world, but it operates on broadly the same principle. Middle-class consumers all around the world can and do own the very same smartphone that celebrities and presidents and billionaires use. A brand-new iPhone is certainly a premium product — you can get a perfectly serviceable Android phone for $200 — but it’s also a mass market product, an “affordable luxury” that lets regular people achieve phone parity with the elite.  iPhone X changes all that. The anticipation now is that most iPhone buyers won’t be getting the best phone in the world, they’ll be settling for the iPhone 8.  The most interesting Apple launch in years  In the plane of pure reason, the iPhone X shouldn’t be a big deal. Either consumers will buy a $1,000 phone and Apple will make some extra money or else they won’t and Apple won’t repeat the experiment. Either way, the iPhone 8 will be the big financial driver.  But consumer purchasing decisions don’t happen on the plane of pure reason.  The risk for Apple is that people who are willing to pay $750 for the best phone in the world may not feel like shelling out that much cash to have the second-best phone in the world. If the best phone in the world is out of your price range and you’re a value buyer now, maybe you decide that the real value proposition is that $200 Android. Or simply not upgrading your phone at all. The best phone is a powerful idea that potentially transcends narrow cost-benefit analysis. Voluntarily surrendering your mass market product’s status as the best is a risky move.  Of course it’s also a risk with considerable upside for Apple. But in a world where the past few iPhones felt like sure things and Apple seemed to have decisively pulled ahead of its major competitors, the fact that there’s a risk at all makes this the most exciting iPhone launch in years.",https://www.vox.com/2017/9/12/16290308/iphone-x
884,9/12/17,,12,31,2099,Apple iPhone event live updates,"At its debut Apple Park public event Tuesday, Apple is expected to unveil a range of new hardware and software products — including three new iPhones, a new Apple TV, and two new Apple Watches.  Check here for updates as specific products are announced. So far it’s just been a Beatles song followed by a tribute to Steve Jobs, paired with the introduction of the new Steve Jobs Theater in the company’s new headquarters.  Next up, a discussion of the virtues of the new Apple Park campus and Angela Ahrendts discussing Apple’s retail operations.  Apple Watch Series 3  Apple announced Watch OS 4, new operating software for its line of watches that focuses on expanding Apple Watch’s various fitness and health capabilities.  They also announced a new version of the Apple Watch — Series 3 — that comes with a cellular data chip, meaning the watch functions independently from the phone. A person probably wouldn’t want to do this in most circumstances, but for a lot of exercise uses, it’s important. With the Series 3 watch, for example, you can take a run without your phone and rely on the watch for streaming music and also make sure that you won’t miss an important text message or phone call.  Old bands will be compatible with the new watches, and they will cost $399. There is also going to be a non-cellular Series 3 watch for $329 and a price drop on the old Series 1 watch to $249.  Apple TV 4k  Apple's little black puck that you plug into your television has fallen slightly behind the technical curve of competing offerings from Amazon, Roku, and others. That's changing today with Apple's announcement of a new, more powerful box, powered by the same custom A10X Fusion chip that powers the iPad Pro and the ability to display 4k video and meet the contemporary High Dynamic Range standard.  It's basically a full-fledged small desktop computer at this point, a further hint that Apple has real ambitions for the device as a gaming platform — though the previous iteration of this product largely failed to live up to potential in this regard.  iTunes is also going to start selling 4k movies and, even better, will automatically upgrade previously purchased HD content to 4k quality.  iPhone 8 and 8 Plus  As expected, Apple is releasing updates to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus — called the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. They have louder speakers with deeper bass, new screens that feature the TrueTone color-correction technology previous only available on iPads, and a powerful new A11 chip that promises to be both more powerful and more energy-efficient than its predecessor.  As previously the Plus model is physically larger, with a bigger screen and longer battery life, and also features a superior two-lens camera.  The iPhone 8 also features what Apple is calling “wireless” charging — a feature that already exists on the Apple Watch and that still features wires. The difference is that instead of plugging a wire into the phone, you’ll be able to inductively charge it via contact with a charging pad — a somewhat more convenient and elegant method.  Pricing starts, as usual, at $699 for iPhone 8 and $799 for iPhone 8 Plus, but the minimum storage tier has gotten more generous than it was for the iPhone 7.  iPhone X  Last but by no means least, there’s the iPhone X (Apple pronounces the “X” as “ten”) which features a new Super Retina OLED display. It’s a 2436x1125 display with 2.7 million pixels, adding up to the highest pixel density the iPhone has ever achieved. It runs from edge to edge with no bezel.  The home button is gone from this bezel-free phone, and can be awakened with an arbitrary tap or by raising the phone. You bring up the home screen with a wipe.  Instead of TouchID, you are going to identify yourself to the phone via a new facial recognition system that Apple calls Face ID. The same “true depth” camera that allows Face ID to work will also let users create animated emoji (“animoji”).  It costs $999 with 64GB of storage, and there’s an upgraded option with 256GB of storage.

1019,9/5/17,,12,31,2099,"In honor of Labor Day, Fox & Friends let an obscure acupuncturist lie about raising the minimum wage","Fox News used an unqualified crank to push discredited right-wing media myths about the economic costs of raising the minimum wage in response to Fight for $15 rallies held across the country on Labor Day.  On the September 5 edition of Fox News’ Fox & Friends, co-host Steve Doocy hosted Kevin McNamee, an obscure chiropractor and acupuncturist, to discuss rallies held in Boston, Chicago, Milwaukee, and Oakland where demonstrators called for raising the minimum wage. McNamee claimed raising minimum wages takes profits away from business owners and hurts the economy. He further claimed that Seattle, WA, -- a frequent target of anti-minimum wage attacks -- had seen companies in the hospitality sector go out of business, which in turn led to job losses, as a result of the city’s minimum wage increase, concluding “it’s not rocket science here.”  McNamee’s only prior experience with economic policy arguments relating to the minimum wage appears to be a letter to the editor that appeared in The New York Times in May 2015, which serial minimum wage misinformer Mark Perry mentioned in an American Enterprise Institute blog post. In the letter, McNamee bizarrely declared his acupuncture business was “not a charity” and that he did not wish reduce his personal profit by paying his employees living wages.  Counter to McNamee and Fox News’ assertions, actual economic research has found raising the hourly minimum wage neither hurt small businesses nor lead to job loss. Looking at minimum wage increases over a 20-year period, researchers at Cornell University found that raising the regular and tipped minimum wage for workers in the restaurant and hospitality industries has ""not had large or reliable effects"" on the number of people working in those industries. Furthermore, since Seattle started phasing in increases to the city’s minimum wage in April 2015, the metro area has continued to grow and add jobs. From the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis:  Fox has repeatedly pushed myths that raising the minimum wage kills jobs and hurts the economy, and has given business owners a platform to bemoan paying workers a living wage. Despite Fox’s years-long misinformation campaign, a majority of Americans support raising the federal minimum wage and states and municipalities have continued to increase their minimum wages.",https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2017/09/05/In-honor-of-Labor-Day-Fox---Friends-let-an-obscure-acupuncturist-lie-about-raising-the-min/217839

Ballmer says he started his new venture, USAFacts, as a way to “suck out all the data” collected by government agencies and shoot it back out to the public in a digestible form. (AP Photo/Stephan Savoia, File)  PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Steve Ballmer says he started his new venture, USAFacts, as a way to “suck out all the data” collected by government agencies and shoot it back out to the public in a digestible form. The former Microsoft CEO, philanthropist and LA Clippers owner talked with The  about data —and the way people and machines collect it.  The interview has been edited for length and clarity.  Q: Microsoft is making a big push now on artificial intelligence. Do you think they’re doing enough?  A: We made a huge investment. People love to change the name over time. If you go back, we were doing speech recognition. Speech recognition’s a form of AI. We were doing computer vision. It’s a form of AI. We’ve been doing machine learning. It’s a form of AI.  Before all that, we were actually calling it AI and doing a bunch of AI. So I would say we’ve been working pretty coherently and consistently since the early ’90s.  The thing that has really changed in AI is the amount of data you can collect to inform the machine so it can get smarter in its learning. Search engines were really the first big, high-popularity AI systems. Now we have digital assistants like Cortana, Alexa, Siri. Self-driving cars are basically machine-learning AI engines. They learn to recognize where other cars are and what actions to take.  So there are a variety of things now that are popping. But it’s an investment Microsoft was making, certainly when I was there, and, by everything I read, as an external, third-party shareholder, the company continues to make good and important investments.  Q: What was your impetus for starting USAFacts?  A: I’m a numbers guy. I’m retired and my wife was talking with me about our philanthropic stuff and I highlighted that government has the most significant role. And that just got me interested in the broader issue of, where does our tax base come from? Where does it go to? Who’s it benefiting? That wound up being a separate interest from the rest of our philanthropy.  Q: There’s been concern that funding for the U.S. Census Bureau could be scaled back. How would that affect what you’re doing?  A: We use Census Bureau data. We don’t create any of our own data. We’re mostly repackaging. It’s fundamental for us that we continue to get the kind of data that the country gets, not only out of the every-10-year census, but there are a bunch of other surveys the Census Bureau runs that are very important.  Q: Is that something you plan to weigh in on?  A: I’m going to weigh in on the fact that we need the data. Sometimes you need better tools and better systems and sometimes you need more people, more budget. I don’t know about that because I don’t run the department. But I do know the outcome. The production of census data is super-important. I will certainly be an advocate for that.",https://www.apnews.com//8c68f30e8d0b4f7e9376d01422ca26be/Insider-Q&A:-Steve-Ballmer-on-data-for-the-people

The Standard & Poor's rating agency cut China's credit rating on Thursday, Sept. 21, 2017 due to its rising debts, highlighting challenges faced by Communist leaders as they cope with slowing economic growth. (AP Photo/Andy Wong)  BEIJING (AP) — China’s Finance Ministry on Friday criticized the cut in the Standard & Poor’s rating agency’s credit rating on Chinese government borrowing as a “wrong decision” and said it ignores the country’s economic strength.  S&P announced the change Thursday, citing rising debt it said increased financial risk. The move added to warnings China’s debt burden might drag on economic growth or threaten the financial system. It followed a similar downgrade by Moody’s Investors Service in May.  The timing is awkward for the ruling Communist Party, which wants to project an image of stability ahead of a twice-a-decade congress next month at which President Xi Jinping is due to be named to a second five-year term as leader.  S&P followed its China downgrade a day later by cutting its credit rating for Hong Kong, citing risks posed by their close ties. The agency said Friday it was reducing its long-term rating on Hong Kong by one notch, to AA+ from AAA, reflecting potential spillover risks.  It said Hong Kong has a good economic outlook, sizable fiscal reserves and credible monetary policy, but that China’s downgrade is “exerting a negative impact” on Hong Kong because of “strong institutional and political ties” between them.  The Finance Ministry complained S&P ignored China’s stable economic growth and reform efforts. It noted official data showed the economy grew by 6.9 percent in the first half of 2017 over a year earlier and government revenue rose by nearly 10 percent.  “The Standard & Poor’s downgrade of China’s sovereign credit rating is a wrong decision,” the ministry said on its website. “This misreading neglects China’s good fundamentals and development potential.”  Total Chinese nongovernment debt rose last year to the equivalent of 257 percent of annual economic output, according to the Bank for International Settlements. That is unusually high for a developing country and up from 143 percent in 2008.  Communist leaders have cited reducing financial risk as a priority this year. They have launched initiatives to reduce debts owed by state companies, including by allowing banks to accept stock as repayment on loans. But private sector analysts say they are moving too slowly.  S&P lowered its rating on China’s sovereign debt by one notch from AA- to A+, still among its highest ratings.  “A prolonged period of strong credit growth has increased China’s economic and financial risks,” said S&P in a statement. That has supported economic growth but “also diminished financial stability to some extent.”  The downgrade could raise Beijing’s borrowing costs slightly but is more significant for its impact on investor sentiment.  “The new rating is still squarely investment grade — there is no real concern about the possibility of default,” said Mark Williams of Capital Economics in a report.  “However, credit continues to expand at a faster pace than output, which points to significant ongoing misallocation of resources,” said Williams. “State sector reforms have continued to disappoint and so the hidden risks on bank balance sheets have continued to build.”  Chinese economic growth fell from 14.2 percent in 2007 to 6.7 percent last year, though that still was among the world’s strongest.  The government is trying to make the economy more productive by giving market forces a bigger role. It is trying to shrink bloated industries such as steel and cement in which supply exceeds demand, which has depressed prices and led to financial losses.  Beijing is trying to steer the economy to slower, more sustainable growth based on domestic consumption instead of investment and exports. But growth has dipped faster than planners wanted, raising the risk of politically dangerous job losses. Beijing has responded by flooding the economy with credit.  Official efforts to rein in debt “could stabilize the trend of financial risk,” S&P said. “However, we foresee that credit growth in the next two to three years will remain at levels that will increase financial risks gradually.”",https://www.apnews.com//743f86862f5a4b85844dcc10f96e3f8c/China-criticizes-S&P-credit-rating-cut-as-'wrong-decision'

The letter came two weeks after Facebook revealed to Congress that a Russian account had paid for 3,000 ads between June 2015 and May 2017.  In the letter, they urge the FEC to take “immediate steps” to fixing what they see is a critical issue:  We encourage the Federal Election Commission to take immediate steps to understand the threats posed to our democratic process by foreign influenced internet and social media advertisement, and to promulgate new guidance on how advertisement platforms can better prevent foreign nationals from illicitly spending in future U.S. elections.  Representative John Sarbanes, the current chair of the House Democrats’ Democracy Reform Task Force, argued that the letter was an “opportunity for the FEC to step up and show what it’s made of, to show its mettle,” and that “this could be the finest hour to respond to this threat to American democracy.” Senator Kirsten Gillibrand had stronger words when she told CNN that Russian companies are not “above the law and it is illegal for foreign countries to undermine or participate in our elections, so buying those Facebook ads is illegal.”  The letter has been signed by 16 Democratic Senators, including Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris, and four Democratic Representatives. There are no Republican signatories on the letter.  However, there are already concerns on the left that nobody is doing enough at the moment regarding the advertisements. Chris Nolan, a Democratic political ad executive, told Axios that he was worried that the potential response from the FEC and any legislation passed by Congress would not be sufficient to tackle the “threat”:  The problem with the FEC and potential regulation talk from members of Congress is that they aren’t going far enough and it seems like they’re taking a TV filter and applying it to ad spends on digital.  It remains to be seen whether the FEC, who is comprised of three Republicans, one Independent and one Democrat will even follow up on the letter at all. The FEC has been asked to respond by October 4.",http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2017/09/26/democrats-push-for-ban-on-political-ads-from-foreign-companies-on-social-media/
1368,9/27/17,Yes,12,31,2099,5 reasons why 3 STDs are roaring back in America,"We don’t talk much about chlamydia, gonorrhea, or syphilis, in part because it can seem like they’re not big health issues anymore. But it turns out more and more Americans may be quietly suffering from these once nearly eliminated STDs.  According to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were nearly 2.3 million cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis reported in the United States in 2017 — the highest cumulative number ever recorded, and one that surpassed a 2016 record high.  The leaps in cases over the last few years are truly eye-popping. Between 2013 and 2017, the rate of:  Gonorrhea increased by 67 percent to 555,608 cases  increased by to 555,608 cases Syphilis increased by 76 percent to 30,644 cases  increased by to 30,644 cases Chlamydia increased by 22 percent to 1.7 million cases  To appreciate just how astonishing the trends are, consider that as recently as a decade ago, these STDs were at historic lows or near elimination, with more and better screening and diagnostics to help identify cases and get people into treatment.  Syphilis can show up on the body in sores and rashes. Gonorrhea and chlamydia can lurk with no symptoms. They’re all generally easy to cure with a timely antibiotics prescription, but when left untreated, they can lead to infertility or life-threatening health complications. That’s what makes screening and access to health care so important.  The increase in cases between across all three diseases was significant, and represents changing disease dynamics.“We are sliding backward,” said Jonathan Mermin, director of CDC’s National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, in a statement. “It is evident the systems that identify, treat, and ultimately prevent STDs are strained to near-breaking point.”  African Americans and men who have sex with men have traditionally been the populations most plagued by gonorrhea and syphilis (and they’re still disproportionately affected). But other groups are now catching up too, especially women and babies in contracting syphilis.  So what’s behind the spread of these diseases here? There’s no single explanation. Like most health trends, it’s complicated. But here are a few ideas, according to experts:  1) There’s been a rise in condomless sex among men who have sex with men: Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men are generally more at risk for STDs than women and men who have sex with women only. (The majority of new syphilis and gonorrhea cases occurred among men, and in particular, men who have sex with men.) And there’s been some concern about a shift toward riskier sexual behaviors in this group — like not wearing condoms — that may be contributing to the rise in STDs.  The reason for this shift has been explained by everything from the success in treating HIV (and therefore making sex less scary) to the advent of PrEP (pills that can prevent HIV). A systematic review published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases found that some PrEP users are having more risky sex — and are being diagnosed with more sexually transmitted infections.  HIV and syphilis are also interlinked: Some half of men diagnosed with a new syphilis infection also have HIV. And as these diseases spread in particular populations, like men who have sex with men, there’s a greater risk of them moving even further.  “The fear, which I share, is that we won’t contain syphilis among men who have sex with men,” Matthew Golden, director of the Public Health for the Seattle and King County HIV/STD control program, told  in 2017. “And if the epidemic in men who have sex with men gets big enough, which is what is happening, there are enough people who have sex with both men and women that it won’t be possible to contain it.”  2) STDs are spreading more broadly and into populations that weren’t traditionally affected — like babies: A 2017 CDC report on STDs in America showed that more women are getting syphilis these days, and they’re passing it to their babies. When an expectant mother is infected with the disease, and goes undiagnosed and untreated, the bacteria can get into her bloodstream and move through her placenta to her baby. Congenital syphilis is associated with serious health consequences, like stillbirths and neonatal deaths.  In 2016, there were 628 cases of congenital syphilis, an increase of 27.6 percent from 2015 — and that number includes 41 related deaths. According to the CDC, much of the rise was driven by increases in cases in the Western US. Between 2012 and 2016, Western states saw an astounding 366 percent rise in congenital syphilis.  The large increase has to do, in part, with the fact that many Western states have recently had few syphilis cases in women. “We were starting from almost nothing [in Washington],” said Golden. But that’s changing, and with more women getting the disease, their babies are at risk too.  3) With the rise of dating apps, sex is more readily available and more anonymous — and that makes it harder for health investigators to track outbreaks: Health experts increasingly view apps and sites such as Tinder, Grindr, and OkCupid as enablers of high-risk sex, helping people meet and hook up more efficiently than ever before. The impact of these sites is so profound they are also transforming the way health officials track and prevent outbreaks.  “We used to think about what we can do with bathhouses and sex clubs to make sure people’s risk was reduced,” said Dan Wohlfeiler, director of Building Healthy Online Communities, a public health group that works with apps to support STI prevention, told  in 2017. These places, after all, had become important meeting points for men who have sex with men — the group most affected by the HIV epidemic.  Today, the public health focus has shifted to what some have called “digital bathhouses.”  “Many people worry about the impact of dating apps on HIV and STD transmission, but don’t recognize the potential of apps to be a key partner for prevention,” said Dan Wohlfeiler, the director Building Healthy Online Communities, a consortium of public health agencies working closely with owners of apps and dating sites.  4) The numbers may be higher because we may be better at detecting cases in some groups: The rise in chlamydia — which overwhelmingly causes no symptoms but can lead to infertility in women — may be an artifact of better detection and screening. The CDC keeps finding that rates of chlamydia are highest among young women, the group that’s been targeted for routine chlamydia screening. So an increase could just mean more testing.  5) Cuts to public health funding mean fewer STD clinics: Public health in the US — which includes operating STD clinics where people can get tested and into treatment — is historically underfunded. (As of 2012, only 3 percent of the health budget went to public health measures; the rest went mostly to personal health care.) And since the global financial crisis, public health funding has really taken a battering. There are 50,000 fewer public health jobs since 2008, and many STD clinics have had to reduce their hours or shut down.  STD clinics were a traditional safety net for people with these diseases. If those clinics continue to be harder to reach or vanish, finding and treating STDs will become even more difficult — and the diseases will continue to spread.  So in some ways, the STD increases across the country may have less to do with a changing sexual landscape, and more to do with more limited access to sexual health care. With Trump’s proposed public health budget cuts, the problem may be poised to get worse.  “It’s not a coincidence STDs are skyrocketing — state and local STD programs are working with effectively half the budget they had in the early 2000s,” said David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, in a statement today. “If our representatives are serious about protecting American lives, they will provide adequate funding to address this crisis. Right now, our STD prevention engine is running on fumes.”",https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/9/27/16371142/2016-record-year-syphilis-gonorrhea-chlamydia

1435,9/8/17,Yes,12,31,2099,2 gonzo ideas for slowing down a hurricane that might actually work,"As heavy winds from Hurricane Michael begin to lash Florida’s Gulf Coast, forecasters are urging residents of the panhandle, Big Bend, and Nature Coast to prepare for life-threatening storm surge and flooding.  With so much potential devastation, one may wonder whether anything can be done to stop Michael in its tracks.  It’s quite a daunting challenge, given that the average hurricane’s wind energy equals about half of the world’s electricity production in a year. The energy it releases as it forms clouds is 200 times the world’s annual electricity use.  The heat energy of a fully formed hurricane is “equivalent to a 10-megaton nuclear bomb exploding every 20 minutes,” as NOAA meteorologist Chris Landsea has explained.  And these are typical hurricanes, not extraordinarily intense ones we’ve seen lately, like Hurricane Florence, Hurricane Harvey, and Hurricane Maria.  There’s really not much anyone can do once hurricanes like these spool up. Scientists have tried and failed to stop full-on hurricanes in their tracks.  But rising sea levels and increasing average temperatures due to climate change are further expanding the destructive reach of these storms. And with an eye to the potential to save lives and avoid billions of dollars in damage, some engineers and entrepreneurs, including Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, are studying ways to dial back the destruction.  Much of the research is focused on manipulating temperature, moisture, and wind to steer when and where these storms will occur. It involves geoengineering with giant tubes and aerosols. And it’s pretty intriguing — if still quite preliminary.  Scientists have tried to stop hurricanes — and failed miserably  Weather modification has a long, sordid history and hurricanes have inspired some of the more far-fetched proposals, from bombarding cyclones with sonic booms from aircraft to beaming down microwaves from space into nascent storms.  In one of the most infamous attempts to slay a hurricane, Nobel laureate Irving Langmuir led a US military experiment in 1947 to seed Hurricane King with ice in hopes of sapping its vigor. The storm at the time was sliding away from the United States and losing strength.  In an excerpt in the Atlantic from his book Caesar’s Last Breath, author Sam Kean explained Langmuir’s idea: Growing ice in the eye of the hurricane would make the eye grow wider and collapse the storm. But Hurricane King didn’t respond as expected. “To everyone’s horror, it then pivoted—taking an impossible 135-degree turn—and began racing into Savannah, Georgia, causing $3 million in damage ($32 million today) and killing one person,” Kean writes.  Other meteorologists at the time were skeptical that Langmuir’s experiment made the storm change course.  US scientists continued to study seeding clouds inside hurricanes as late as 1983 under Project STORMFURY. But they concluded, according to NOAA, that “cloud seeding had little prospect of success because hurricanes contained too much natural ice and too little supercooled water.”  The remaining tactics for fighting hurricanes require weakening them before they start by deliberately cooling seas and brightening clouds when storms are brewing, robbing them of the fuel for their destruction.  Stephen Salter, an emeritus professor of engineering design at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, has studied how to harness wave energy since the 1970s, and in 2003 began looking into using this energy to cool the seas.  A less-crazy but still far-out idea: cooling the seas with a giant tube  For ocean temperatures, the magic number for hurricane formation is 26.5 degrees Celsius (or 79.7 degrees Fahrenheit). So what if you could nudge that number down early on and reduce the risks and intensities of ensuing storms?  That was what Salter set out to do.  To cool the surface of the ocean, Salter invented a wave-powered pump that would move warm surface water down to depths as far as about 650 feet.  Made from a ring of tires lashed together around a tube extending below the surface, waves would overtop the ring, pushing the column of water down, while a check valve in the tube would keep it from flowing back.  Salter’s namesake device, the Salter Sink, was invented in 2009 at Intellectual Ventures, a technology firm led by former Microsoft Chief Technology Officer Nathan Myhrvold.  (Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates also filed for a patent in 2009 to cool the ocean’s surface with barges to fight hurricanes.)  The idea is that hundreds of thousands of these devices in hurricane-prone regions of the world would cool waters enough to make a measurable reduction in the strength of storms.  Another promising scheme: making clouds a tiny bit brighter  Salter’s other tactic for fighting hurricanes is making clouds a tiny bit brighter using aerosols, harnessing a phenomenon called the Twomey effect.  This is the observation that for clouds containing the same amount of moisture, the clouds with smaller suspended water droplets reflect more sunlight.  The increased sunlight reflectance in the sky would keep the waters below from warming up to the hurricane threshold while also curbing evaporation, thereby reducing the atmospheric moisture needed to make a storm.  “If you really want to stop hurricanes, I believe that cloud brightening is the better way to do it,” Salter said. Cloud brightening yields a much greater impact on the weather for a much smaller perturbation than directly cooling the ocean, he explained.  Salter envisions unmanned boats spraying sub-micron-sized water droplets into the sky, seeding shinier clouds in areas forecasted to spawn storms.  This would be much cheaper than spraying aerosols from aircraft, the boats could target specific regions, the effects would dissipate quickly and the change in cloud brightness would be imperceptible to the human eye.  He estimated that it would cost $40 million to construct a prototype cloud seeding system but has not been able to find any public or private takers.  “At the moment, the governments are saying its premature, we don't need it yet,” he added. “Irma might change their minds.”  However, Salter acknowledged the prospect of cloud brightening is just an idea at this point. “Most of the work is done in computers,” he said.  One reason diffusing a hurricane is so hard: conditions have to be perfect and they’re often not  For those that have tried out weakening the ingredients of hurricanes in the real world, the results have been disappointing.  Atmocean, a company developing ways to harness energy from ocean waves, looked into making devices to cool the surface of the ocean after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.  Unlike Salter’s device, Atmocean’s approach used a contraption to instead bring cooler water from the depths up to the surface.  The test devices proved successful, but only under ideal wave, temperature, and geographic conditions.  “The physics of it work if the conditions are right,” said Atmocean CEO Philip Kithil. “You can in fact reduce the upper ocean [temperature] by a degree Celsius, maybe 2, which would have a measurable effect on the intensity of the hurricane, but the practical concerns were hard to overcome.”  The wave pumps have to be right in the path of a developing hurricane, and they require cool water to be at an accessible depth, which isn’t always the case. It definitely wasn’t the case in late August when Hurricane Harvey barreled through the Gulf of Mexico toward Texas.  “Harvey passed through an area where there was warm water all the way down to the bottom of the ocean,” Kithil said. “If there is no cold water, you can’t change anything.”  According to a study the company conducted looking back at Katrina, they found that they would need to deploy 100,000 pumps over just two days at a cost of $1,000 each, leading to a price tag topping $1 billion to mitigate the effects of the storm.  At those prices, planners have to consider whether that money would be better spent elsewhere, such as evacuations or shoreline hardening, and neither insurance companies nor governments were willing to investigate further.  Reinsurance firm Swiss Re estimated that Katrina led to $80 billion in insured losses.  Kithil noted that the company also had a hard time finding buyers for their devices. “The insurance industry was not willing to invest, since it was too early stage, too hypothetical,” he said. “And governments are not that proactive.”  Atmocean bowed out of the weather modification business in 2007 and has since pivoted toward using wave energy to drive desalination and onshore aquaculture.  Some hurricane researchers are skeptical these schemes will ever work  At the same time, hurricane researchers have grown weary of responding to proposals to slow storms and most remain skeptical that any tactic could be deployed in large enough numbers to have an effect on giant cyclones.  “As a general comment they show a lack of appreciation for the physical scale of hurricanes and simple ignorance of how they work,” wrote Hugh Willoughby, a hurricane researcher at Florida International University, in an email.  Mark Bourassa, associate director of the Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies at Florida State University, echoed the skepticism about scale.  “For sea surface temperature change, you would have to do it over a very large area and you would have to do it quickly,” he said.  These ideas might be useful thought experiments to better understand the makings of hurricanes, but Bourassa noted that there always concerns about unintended consequences, especially about deploying these tactics at scale.  Scientists already have a hard-enough time recognizing hurricane progenitors and figuring out where the storms will go once they’re spinning, so adding artificially brighter clouds and cooler waters to the mix could prove dangerous.  “I’d be really nervous about trying them,” he said.  For now, computer models are the only place to deploy hurricane mitigation tactics, but that hasn’t deterred Salter, who despite his retirement and lack of a patron says he’s “still working seven days a week on it.”",https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/9/8/16264376/stopping-a-hurricane-science

1470,,,12,31,2099,The flu vaccine isn't perfect — but that doesn't mean you should skip the shot,"Dear Julia: How well do flu shots actually work?  Just about every influential public health figure urges people to get their flu shots each fall as a necessary precaution during influenza season.  So over dinner, I asked a couple of respected evidence-based medicine researchers what they thought of the vaccine. I was taken aback by their response. They basically laughed at the idea that the flu shot was particularly effective.  This posed a conundrum. It seemed like there were two groups saying very different things. But after reviewing the research, I think I understand what's going on here. It's true that flu vaccines don't work spectacularly well, at least according to the best evidence we have (and most of the evidence on flu vaccines is of poor methodological quality). But the downsides to getting a vaccine are extremely minimal, and flu shots may still be helpful in reducing some illness and saving lives, which is why public health experts say you should get vaccinated anyway.  Why the flu vaccine isn't always effective  The flu vaccine has been our main strategy for warding off seasonal flu for more than 60 years. Seasonal influenza, which surfaces as a respiratory illness, is caused by influenza A and B viruses. The flu shot is designed to protect people against three or four strains of the A and B viruses that researchers believe will be most common that year, leading to the nasty fevers, headaches, coughs, and runny noses that make many people miserable in the fall and winter.  The challenge, however, is that the flu virus is highly unstable, mutating all the time. So this means drug companies can't just make one kind of vaccine that'll last a lifetime. Every year, public health agencies essentially make educated guesses on what strains and mutations will make the rounds. And that's not easy. In February, the World Health Organization offers a prediction — based on surveillance and laboratory and clinical studies — and then each country uses that prediction to approve vaccines in its jurisdiction. (In the US, the Food and Drug Administration makes that final call.) The potential for error here can dramatically alter the effectiveness of the flu shot in a given season. If vaccine makers prepare for one combination of viruses and different ones end up circulating widely, the vaccine won't work that well.  This may help explain why the evidence on the effectiveness of flu shots is relatively mixed. The Cochrane Collaboration, an independent nonprofit that reviews the evidence on medical questions, has conducted two major meta-analyses (looking at the results of lots of individual studies) on whether the shot prevents flu in healthy children and adults.  In kids, the highest-quality evidence — a randomized controlled trial — suggests the vaccine works well enough: On average, if you give six kids under the age of 6 a flu shot, you can expect to prevent one case of the flu. For children under age 2, the benefits are less clear; the evidence, the researchers found, was scant, and of the research that was available, it seemed the efficacy of the shot was similar to placebo.  In adults, however, the vaccine's effects are more modest. ""Depending on the season,"" explained Tom Jefferson, an author on these Cochrane reviews, ""you need to vaccinate anywhere between 33 and 100 people to avoid one set of symptoms."" In a good year, when the WHO guesses correctly and the flu shot matches the strains in circulation, you need to give 33 adults flu shots, on average, to prevent one case of illness. In a year when the WHO guesses badly, you need to vaccinate 100 people to prevent one flu case.  Jefferson pointed out that his Cochrane review on adults also found that flu vaccination rates have barely any effect on the number of sick days taken and no major impact on rates of hospitalization. So, yes, the flu vaccine can prevent illness, but it's hard to detect major effects on public health in the data.  On the other hand, the evidence suggests that there's no harm in getting a flu shot, either. The meta-analyses found no evidence of serious side effects beyond the odd case of soreness at the injection site.  That seems to be the same conclusion that other studies have drawn — the flu vaccine is modestly helpful, and doesn't hurt. In 2012 researchers analyzed 15 meta-analyses on the flu shot and concluded, ""Most influenza vaccines have been shown to confer some protection against naturally acquired infection and no evidence for major harms has emerged.""  One key caveat here is that the evidence, overall, is pretty poor quality. Most of these analyses rely overwhelmingly on observational studies, where researchers observe and gather data on people who take the flu shot compared with those who don't. Because these aren't experiments — ideally we'd have randomized controlled trials — they're more prone to bias and therefore less reliable.  In the case of the elderly, the situation is particularly troublesome. As this Lancet study points out, because annual flu shots were recommended for the elderly since the 1960s, it has been unethical to conduct high-quality randomized controlled trials where you give only one group the shot in order to compare it with another group that didn't get the vaccine. So, as this Cochrane review notes, it's impossible to draw firm conclusions on the effectiveness of the flu vaccine for those over 65 because the data is so biased and poor.  Again, though, this doesn't mean we should throw away the vaccine. Stanford researcher John Ioannidis told me how he makes sense of this issue after reviewing the evidence: ""Overall the flu vaccine is effective, and it does save lives. I cannot put an exact figure to how many, but it may well be millions of lives. Generally it is safe and rather cheap, so even if the effectiveness is less than optimal sometimes, overall it is a good deal.""  Why people still bother to get the shot  Despite the limited evidence of effectiveness, there are still good reasons why public health experts recommend the shot.  For one, in those years when the WHO guesses correctly which strains will circulate, the shot tends to be a lot more helpful than some of these averages suggest. And the vaccine is overwhelmingly safe. There's also little by way of alternatives. Beyond public health measures (making sure you have good hand hygiene and avoiding the office when you're sick), the flu shot is the best medical intervention we have for preventing infection. So there's little downside with at least some potential benefit. I personally continue to get the flu shot for this reason.  As Roger Baxter, the co-director of the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center, told me, ""Flu vaccines are not a panacea, and do not prevent all cases of flu, even in the best years, when there are no manufacturing problems and the match is perfect."" He continued: ""However, the vaccines provide moderate protection, and can prevent huge numbers of cases of this serious illness. Many studies have shown that the vaccines are very safe, so the benefit-to-risk ratio is high and the cost is relatively low.""

1471,9/27/17,Yes,12,31,2099,5 reasons why 3 STDs are roaring back in America,"We don’t talk much about chlamydia, gonorrhea, or syphilis, in part because it can seem like they’re not big health issues anymore. But it turns out more and more Americans may be quietly suffering from these once nearly eliminated STDs.  According to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were nearly 2.3 million cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis reported in the United States in 2017 — the highest cumulative number ever recorded, and one that surpassed a 2016 record high.  The leaps in cases over the last few years are truly eye-popping. Between 2013 and 2017, the rate of:  Gonorrhea increased by 67 percent to 555,608 cases  increased by to 555,608 cases Syphilis increased by 76 percent to 30,644 cases  increased by to 30,644 cases Chlamydia increased by 22 percent to 1.7 million cases  To appreciate just how astonishing the trends are, consider that as recently as a decade ago, these STDs were at historic lows or near elimination, with more and better screening and diagnostics to help identify cases and get people into treatment.  Syphilis can show up on the body in sores and rashes. Gonorrhea and chlamydia can lurk with no symptoms. They’re all generally easy to cure with a timely antibiotics prescription, but when left untreated, they can lead to infertility or life-threatening health complications. That’s what makes screening and access to health care so important.  The increase in cases between across all three diseases was significant, and represents changing disease dynamics.“We are sliding backward,” said Jonathan Mermin, director of CDC’s National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, in a statement. “It is evident the systems that identify, treat, and ultimately prevent STDs are strained to near-breaking point.”  African Americans and men who have sex with men have traditionally been the populations most plagued by gonorrhea and syphilis (and they’re still disproportionately affected). But other groups are now catching up too, especially women and babies in contracting syphilis.  So what’s behind the spread of these diseases here? There’s no single explanation. Like most health trends, it’s complicated. But here are a few ideas, according to experts:  1) There’s been a rise in condomless sex among men who have sex with men: Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men are generally more at risk for STDs than women and men who have sex with women only. (The majority of new syphilis and gonorrhea cases occurred among men, and in particular, men who have sex with men.) And there’s been some concern about a shift toward riskier sexual behaviors in this group — like not wearing condoms — that may be contributing to the rise in STDs.  The reason for this shift has been explained by everything from the success in treating HIV (and therefore making sex less scary) to the advent of PrEP (pills that can prevent HIV). A systematic review published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases found that some PrEP users are having more risky sex — and are being diagnosed with more sexually transmitted infections.  HIV and syphilis are also interlinked: Some half of men diagnosed with a new syphilis infection also have HIV. And as these diseases spread in particular populations, like men who have sex with men, there’s a greater risk of them moving even further.  “The fear, which I share, is that we won’t contain syphilis among men who have sex with men,” Matthew Golden, director of the Public Health for the Seattle and King County HIV/STD control program, told  in 2017. “And if the epidemic in men who have sex with men gets big enough, which is what is happening, there are enough people who have sex with both men and women that it won’t be possible to contain it.”  2) STDs are spreading more broadly and into populations that weren’t traditionally affected — like babies: A 2017 CDC report on STDs in America showed that more women are getting syphilis these days, and they’re passing it to their babies. When an expectant mother is infected with the disease, and goes undiagnosed and untreated, the bacteria can get into her bloodstream and move through her placenta to her baby. Congenital syphilis is associated with serious health consequences, like stillbirths and neonatal deaths.  In 2016, there were 628 cases of congenital syphilis, an increase of 27.6 percent from 2015 — and that number includes 41 related deaths. According to the CDC, much of the rise was driven by increases in cases in the Western US. Between 2012 and 2016, Western states saw an astounding 366 percent rise in congenital syphilis.  The large increase has to do, in part, with the fact that many Western states have recently had few syphilis cases in women. “We were starting from almost nothing [in Washington],” said Golden. But that’s changing, and with more women getting the disease, their babies are at risk too.  3) With the rise of dating apps, sex is more readily available and more anonymous — and that makes it harder for health investigators to track outbreaks: Health experts increasingly view apps and sites such as Tinder, Grindr, and OkCupid as enablers of high-risk sex, helping people meet and hook up more efficiently than ever before. The impact of these sites is so profound they are also transforming the way health officials track and prevent outbreaks.  “We used to think about what we can do with bathhouses and sex clubs to make sure people’s risk was reduced,” said Dan Wohlfeiler, director of Building Healthy Online Communities, a public health group that works with apps to support STI prevention, told  in 2017. These places, after all, had become important meeting points for men who have sex with men — the group most affected by the HIV epidemic.  Today, the public health focus has shifted to what some have called “digital bathhouses.”  “Many people worry about the impact of dating apps on HIV and STD transmission, but don’t recognize the potential of apps to be a key partner for prevention,” said Dan Wohlfeiler, the director Building Healthy Online Communities, a consortium of public health agencies working closely with owners of apps and dating sites.  4) The numbers may be higher because we may be better at detecting cases in some groups: The rise in chlamydia — which overwhelmingly causes no symptoms but can lead to infertility in women — may be an artifact of better detection and screening. The CDC keeps finding that rates of chlamydia are highest among young women, the group that’s been targeted for routine chlamydia screening. So an increase could just mean more testing.  5) Cuts to public health funding mean fewer STD clinics: Public health in the US — which includes operating STD clinics where people can get tested and into treatment — is historically underfunded. (As of 2012, only 3 percent of the health budget went to public health measures; the rest went mostly to personal health care.) And since the global financial crisis, public health funding has really taken a battering. There are 50,000 fewer public health jobs since 2008, and many STD clinics have had to reduce their hours or shut down.  STD clinics were a traditional safety net for people with these diseases. If those clinics continue to be harder to reach or vanish, finding and treating STDs will become even more difficult — and the diseases will continue to spread.  So in some ways, the STD increases across the country may have less to do with a changing sexual landscape, and more to do with more limited access to sexual health care. With Trump’s proposed public health budget cuts, the problem may be poised to get worse.  “It’s not a coincidence STDs are skyrocketing — state and local STD programs are working with effectively half the budget they had in the early 2000s,” said David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, in a statement today. “If our representatives are serious about protecting American lives, they will provide adequate funding to address this crisis. Right now, our STD prevention engine is running on fumes.”",https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/9/27/16371142/2016-record-year-syphilis-gonorrhea-chlamydia
1477,10/2/17,,12,31,2099,Replacing Faulty Heart Devices Costs Medicare $1.5 Billion in 10 Years,"David Lamir, an official in the inspector general’s Boston office, said the $1.5 billion figure represented a “drop in the bucket” of the true costs to Medicare from medical products that malfunction. He said device failures not only waste money, but also can expose patients to a “high risk of illness,” including needless surgeries.  The report said that medical device recalls nearly doubled from 2003 through 2012 and noted that they have probably cost Medicare billions of dollars. In the past five to six years, more than 200 cardiac devices have been recalled, according to the inspector general’s office. In most cases, manufacturers withdrew their products voluntarily after reports surfaced of injuries or malfunctions. Device makers are required to report problems they learn of, often from doctors and hospitals, to a database run by the Food and Drug Administration.  Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Center for Health Research who has testified before Congress on device safety, said her organization supports making hospitals report malfunctioning devices when they seek Medicare payments to cover an implant surgery. She said the change would help officials pinpoint faulty devices before issuing a recall for tens of thousands of products in patients.  “It would be much more obvious much more quickly which implanted devices were causing problems,” she said.  Ms. Zuckerman noted that the report did not touch on other high-profile device failures, like metal-on-metal hip implants or vaginal mesh.  Medical device companies and some doctors have opposed tighter reporting, arguing that it would be costly and difficult to integrate with existing payment claim forms and might not yield useful information.  “It is abundantly clear that data collected in electronic health records is a far superior and more cost-effective method for monitoring the performance of medical devices,” said Mark Leahey, who heads the Medical Device Manufacturers Association.

1486,10/1/17,,12,31,2099,Elon Musk’s SpaceX Goes All-in for ‘Big F***ing Rocket’ to Mars,"CEO Elon Musk announced Friday that SpaceX is going all-in for interplanetary commuting to Mars by developing its next-generation rocket, called BFR (short for Big F***king Rocket).   News recently reported that the ability of SpaceX to reliably launch, recover and reuse its Falcon 9 fist-stage booster rockets had radically disrupted the market for satellite launches, servicing the International Space Station, and lunching commercial development of space. SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell estimates that after $1 million in refueling and $3 million in refurbishment, the company’s reusable booster has slashed the standard space launch price from $60 million to $40 million — a one-third savings.  Musk has stated that SpaceX’s future is the BFR, which can lift 660,000 lbs. of cargo into space, or about 12 times as much as the Falcon 9. SpaceX has a Falcon 9 Heavy version ready to fly next year that can lift twice its current payload. But Musk stated that the company will go all-in to fund BFR’s $10 billion estimated cost.  SpaceX’s CEO believes that the company can internally fund the project by increasing its launch frequency, which is up to 13 launches so dar in the first 9 months of the year, versus 8 for all of 2016. SpaceX has the NASA contract to service the International Space Station and launch dozens of commercial satellites, and is performing classified U.S. military launches.  SpaceX’s only real competitor is NASA’s own Space Launch System (SLS), which received funding in 2010 from the Obama Administration as part of the cancelling the Constellation back-to-the-moon program in 2010. NASA expects that by 2023, SLS will be able to lift 290,000 lbs. of cargo into space, about 6 times SpaceX’s Falcon 9.  NASA subcontracted work to Boeing, Lockheed, Orbital ATK, and Aerojet Rocketdyne, but the expected launch cost per non-reusable rocket is a ludicrous $1 billion. That is also before the inevitable government-managed time and cost overrun disasters.  Although the International Space Station has welcomed 200 visitors from 18 countries and hosted 1,900 scientific investigations from researchers in 95 countries since 2001, virtually none of the experiments there were oriented to make space a business platform.  But CB Insights reports that private venture capitalists see big profit opportunities, and their space-oriented investing spiked by 2,052 percent in 2015 to $2.3 billion on 44 deals. With another 40 deals raising $1.5 billion last year, CB’s database has identified 57 space tech startups organized in the three categories of launch, exploration, and downstream technologies.  The really big-bucks bets by VCs are in rockets and space planes, such as Musk’s SpaceX, Jeff Bozos’ Blue Origin, and Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic. But other deals include Planetary Resources receiving $50 million for robotic asteroid mining, and SpaceVR raising $1.25 million on Kickstarter to launch micro-satellites into orbit that will allow consumers to experience space via virtual reality.",http://www.breitbart.com/california/2017/10/01/spacex-goes-big-fing-rocket-mars/

1550,10/3/17,,12,31,2099,"Tax Cuts, Sold as Fuel for Growth, Widen Gap Between Rich and Poor","It is a little unsettling that the intellectual underpinning of tax policy in the United States today was jotted down on a napkin at the Two Continents Restaurant in Washington in December 1974.  That was when, legend has it, Arthur Laffer, a young economist at the University of Chicago, deployed the sketch over dinner to convince Dick Cheney and Donald H. Rumsfeld, aides to President Gerald R. Ford, that raising tax rates would reduce tax revenue by hampering growth.  It was another economy. The top marginal income tax rate was 70 percent then. For three decades, just over 10 percent of the nation’s income had gone to the 1 percent earning the most. Economists believed Simon Kuznets’ proposition that though market forces would widen inequality at early stages of growth, further economic development would ultimately lead it to narrow. The paramount policy challenge of the day was how to raise productivity.  To many economists, Mr. Laffer’s basic argument that high taxes would at some point discourage effort and reduce growth made sense: Why work or invest more if the government will keep almost all the fruits of your troubles? Even Arthur M. Okun, who had been President Lyndon B. Johnson’s chief economic adviser, was writing about leaky buckets to illustrate a trade-off between efficiency and equity: Taxing the rich to pay for programs for the poor could slow growth down, in part by reducing the incentive of the rich to earn more.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/business/economy/tax-rates-growth.html
1557,10/3/17,,12,31,2099,"Gravitational waves, explained","Around 1.3 billion years ago, in a far-flung corner of the universe, two black holes — the densest, most destructive forces known to nature — collided with each other.  A hundred years ago, Albert Einstein predicted that such a massive collision would distort the very fabric of space and time itself. Like a stone cast into a pond, the cataclysmic disturbance would ripple outward at the speed of light, filling the ocean of the universe with gravitational waves. Einstein, however, never thought it would be possible to detect such waves.  In a massive achievement of human ingenuity and patience, scientists announced in 2016 that they had detected these waves as they slid through the Earth. (Since then, they’ve detected them three more times.) And Tuesday, their effort to record gravitational waves for the first time — a decades-long collaboration involving thousands of scientists around the globe — has been awarded the Nobel Prize in physics.  A Nobel can only go to a maximum of three laureates, however, and so this one went to physicists Rainer Weiss, Kip Thorne, and Barry Barish. They pioneered LIGO, or the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, the scientific project that made gravitational wave detection possible.  In the 1970s, Weiss and Thorne dreamed up the initial idea to detect gravitational waves. When Barish took over as lead of the project in 1994, he oversaw the crucial decision to increase the power and sensitivity of the detectors, which allowed for the final discovery. Weiss was awarded one-half of the 9,000,000 Swedish kroner prize (about $1.1 million). Thorne and Barish split the second half.  Though these three got the prize, know that LIGO was the result of thousands of scientists working world over in collaboration for decades. (Critics argue that giving the award to three individuals distorts the public’s perception of how science actually gets done.)  And they didn’t just answer a 100-year-old question — they launched a whole new branch of science.  Right now our telescopes can only see objects that emit electromagnetic radiation — visible light, X-rays, gamma rays, and so on. But some objects, like colliding black holes or the smoking gun of the Big Bang, don't emit any electromagnetic radiation. Instead, they emit gravity. And that's why, with gravitational wave astronomy, hard-to-detect objects in the universe — like black holes and neutron stars — may soon come into clearer focus.  “We now witness the dawn of a new field: gravitational wave astronomy,” Nils Mårtensson, chair of the Nobel Committee for Physics, said at the announcement Tuesday. “This will teach us about the most violent processes in the universe, and it will lead to new insights into the nature of extreme gravity.”  Gravitational waves, explained  Just as sound waves disturb the air to make noise, gravitational waves disturb the fabric of spacetime to push and pull matter as if it existed in a funhouse mirror. If a gravitational wave passed through you, you’d see one of your arms grow longer than the other. If you were wearing a watch on each wrist, you'd see them tick out of sync.  Gravitational waves are generated by any movement of mass. ""For instance, if I wave my arms really crazily, I would generate gravitational waves,"" Sarah Caudill, a physicist at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee, told me in 2016.  But there’s no way to detect gravitational waves that faint. For now, our sensors need a really, really loud source — like the collision of two black holes.  Two black holes colliding unleash a loud thunderclap of gravity. If you were near the black holes when they collided, you’d see the universe expand and contract like you were living inside a funhouse mirror. But by the time they reach the Earth — like ripples nearing the edge of a pond — they grew faint.  One of the waves LIGO heard (around Christmas 2015) was around 0.7 attometers tall. An attometer is 10^-18 meters. That’s so, so unbelievably tiny. It’s much smaller than an atom. The following GIF starts out showing the width of an atom, and then zooms down to 10^-18. It’s amazing that we were able to detect something that small.  And all of this took decades of work: The theory LIGO tested was developed in the early 20th century; the LIGO project was dreamt up in the 1970s and began in earnest in the 1980s. It was first turned on in 2002 and it took an international effort to detect and confirm the waves in 2016. It’s having a big moment now, but it goes to show that big breakthroughs have deep roots, and science is ultimately a collaborative, multigenerational effort.  How to catch a gravitational wave  LIGO, which is funded by the National Science Foundation, consists of two enormous science experiments: One is in Louisiana; the other is located in Washington state. Both are massive L-shaped tubes. Each arm of the tube is 2.5 miles long.  These instruments are called interferometers, and their design is based on work Weiss conducted in the 1960s. Here’s how they work.  During the experiments, a laser beam is split equally between the two arms. At the end of each arm is a mirror, which reflects the laser back to the starting point. What LIGO is looking for is evidence that gravitational waves are distorting spacetime enough that one of the arms becomes temporarily longer than the other.  These changes can be incredibly tiny, since LIGO is sensitive enough to detect a change in distance smaller than the width of a proton.  ""Each detector is like a violin string, and we’re waiting for a gravitational wave to ‘pluck’ each detector string,"" Dave Reitze, the current executive director of the LIGO Project, said last year.  If a wave is detected in one of the sites, it has to be corroborated with the other site (to make sure it's not just a false signal from local automobile traffic or other disturbances).  LIGO was first set up in 2002, and for years it found nothing. In 2010 it was shut down for an upgrade, which extended its range. When it was turned back on in 2015, it almost immediately began hearing the waves.  By listening in on these loud waves, the scientists are able to reconstruct the cataclysmic events that created them. Just from the two detectors, scientists can determine the mass of the black holes and how far away they are, roughly map where in the sky they are, and distill some information about the shape of their orbits.  This past year, a third detector, an Italy-based machine called VIRGO, turned on and also began sensing gravitational waves. In September, both VIRGO and LIGO confirmed a new set of gravitational waves emanating from the smoking gun of two black holes that collided 1.8 billion years ago. It means now we have a global network for gravitational wave astronomy. And it’s only going to improve.  What other cool things can we learn from gravitational wave astronomy?  For now, LIGO can’t be pointed at a region in the sky to search for gravitational waves. Rather, it just hears the gravitational waves that are passing through Earth at any particular moment. And, at first, it didn’t do a great job of pinpointing where these waves were coming from.  But now that VIRGO has been activated, scientists can much more accurately pinpoint the source in the sky. In the following graphic, the blue region represents where LIGO alone thought the waves were coming from. The green region shows how VIRGO made the guess much more precise. “Overall, the volume of universe that is likely to contain the source shrinks by more than a factor of 20,” the LIGO-VIRGO collaboration explained in a press release.  These announcements are going to become more commonplace. Detectors have confirmed four gravitational waves, and many more are certain to come.  And, again, this is a whole new field of astronomy, a whole new eyepiece upon which to observe the universe. Here are some cool things the next era of gravitational wave astronomy could accomplish.  1) Seeing farther back in time  One problem with our current fleet of telescopes is that they can’t see back to the very early universe.  ""If you look with visible light as far as we can look in the universe, the universe is no longer transparent; it becomes opaque,"" Cliff Burgess, a particle physicist at McMaster University, told me in 2016. ""Almost nothing is opaque to gravity."" With LIGO, we could potentially listen in on the gravitational waves emanating from the early universe, or even the Big Bang, and gain a better understand of how it formed.  2) Improving on Einstein’s theory of general relativity  A century ago, Einstein published his theory of general relativity, and it has dominated our understanding of gravity ever since. But physicists (and Einstein himself) have long speculated the theory isn’t complete, as it doesn’t play well with the laws of quantum mechanics. Gravitational waves could help physicists put general relativity to harder and harder tests to see where it fails.  ""We’ve found that these black holes are completely consistent with Einstein’s theory that he formed 100 years ago,"" Caudill says. ""So that’s cool, but as we get more and more detections, we can probe his theory even deeper, and maybe expose holes in it.""  3) Discovering new neutron stars  Neutron stars are the extremely dense cores of collapsed stars that can emit large amounts of gravity. What’s cool about them is that they also produce light. ""If you can see an event like neutron stars colliding, or a black hole and a neutron star colliding,"" with LIGO, Caudill says, you can then point traditional telescopes at them to watch the light show.  4) Learning how common it is for black holes to orbit one another  Before the February announcement, no scientist had observational proof that two black holes could orbit each other. Now we’ve seen two pairs of them doing it. Gravitational wave astronomy will help us understand how many of these pairs exist in the universe.  5) Finding the source of dark matter  Dark matter is theorized to make up 27 percent of all the matter in the universe. But we’ve never seen dark matter (it’s dark!), and we don’t know where it comes from.  Matter creates gravity. Perhaps gravitational waves can help us trace the origins of dark matter. It could exist in the form of many tiny black holes. It could be the remnants of ""primordial"" black holes created at the beginning of the universe. We don’t know.  6) Finding new, weird celestial objects  The universe is a big, dark place.

A U.S. ordered him to leave the country, then trusted him to magically appear when the time came to send him back home. Surely no American in their right mind believes this is the first time a deported immigrant, driving around with an ISIS flag in his trunk was deported and then returned into the general public. As a side note, Somali is one of the terror-hotbed nation’s that President Trump wanted to see temporarily banned from entering the U.S.  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Tuesday that a Somali refugee charged with ramming his car into a Canadian policeman, stabbing him and then injuring four people while leading officers on a high-speed chase over the weekend was ordered deported from the U.S. in 2011.  Jennifer Elzea, an ICE spokeswoman, said Hasan Sharif Abdulahi was taken into ICE’s custody in San Diego in July of that year and in September an immigration judge ordered him sent back to Somalia.          *    Email *  Name      Elzea said Sharif was released from custody two months later then failed to report as ordered for his removal on Jan. 24, 2012. She said efforts to locate him were unsuccessful.  Sharif faces 11 charges, including five of attempted murder in the Saturday night attack in Edmonton, Alberta. Police have raised the possibility of filing terrorism charges against Sharif because there was an Islamic State flag in his car and he was investigated in 2015 for espousing extremist views.  Canadian Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said Sharif, 30, entered Canada legally in 2012 and obtained refugee status.  A preliminary hearing for Sharif opened Tuesday but was recessed so he can find a lawyer. He appeared on closed-circuit television and followed proceedings with the help of an interpreter. The suspect spoke briefly with a lawyer who stepped forward to help.  Edmonton police say they believe Sharif acted alone during the series of attacks, which began around 8:15 p.m. Saturday as police Constable Mike Chernyk was handling crowd control outside a Canadian Football League game at a stadium just northeast of downtown. – AP",https://100percentfedup.com/obamas-broken-u-s-deportation-process-canadas-open-door-immigration-policy-responsible-horrifying-act-terror-somali-immigrant/

We think the leftist media is officially losing it over a president who calls out liars like Mayor Cruz who tried to politicize disaster response by the feds. Can you blame Trump for skipping over her even though he officially greeted her? She lied through her teeth to make Trump and the feds look bad.    A couple other things also peeved the left. They hated the comment from Trump claiming Puerto Rico has ‘thrown our budget a little out of whack’. Chuck Schumer and other Dem leaders came out admonishing Trump.

He added, that the findings suggest there may be more examples in the fossil record.  After collecting the fossil evidence, the team sought further support for their hypothesis that the processes of teeth loss and beak development were connected. So they performed a comparative and statistical analysis of thousands of modern vertebrates to understand the shared characteristics of animals that develop beaks.  They found that beaked animals tended to be born from eggs laid on land and from embryos that had a structure on the tip of their snouts known as a caruncle. The facial structure was made of keratin, the substance found in fingernails, and was used to break through the egg before falling off shortly after. Beaked groups like birds and turtles have caruncles, but snakes and nearly all lizards do not.  Mr. Stiegler linked their analysis to what they found in the fossil record. He said the transition they saw in the jaws of the Limusaurus — where hatchlings and juveniles lose their teeth as they became adults — may have been how the change from toothy dinosaur to beaked bird began.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/science/dinosaurs-beaks-teeth-birds.html
1591,10/4/17,,12,31,2099,Equifax Given Huge IRS Fraud-Prevention Contract Following Massive Security Breach,"The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has awarded Equifax a $7.25 million fraud-prevention contract following the company’s massive security breach which affected over 140 million consumers.  According to Politico, “The IRS will pay Equifax $7.25 million to verify taxpayer identities and help prevent fraud under a no-bid contract issued last week.”  “The credit agency will ‘verify taxpayer identity’ and ‘assist in ongoing identity verification and validations’ at the IRS, according to the award,” Politico’s reported. “The notice describes the contract as a ‘sole source order,’ meaning Equifax is the only company deemed capable of providing the service. It says the order was issued to prevent a lapse in identity checks while officials resolve a dispute over a separate contract.”  In September, it was reported that Equifax had been the victim of a large cyberattack, which potentially left over 140 million consumers’ personal information vulnerable.  Following the attack, Equifax blamed the attack on a single employee who failed to implement a patch. However, according to Tech Crunch, “a patch for that vulnerability had been available for months before the breach occurred.”  The company faced further controversy following the discovery that Equifax’s Terms of Service included a clause in their security assistance website which barred consumers from being able to sue the company before they removed it following consumer backlash.  It was also revealed that the company had been encouraging consumers to visit the wrong security website, a fake, which could have easily been used as a phishing scam and taken more information.  Several lawmakers have criticized the IRS’ decision, including Rep. Suzan DelBene (D-WA) and Earl Blumenauer (D-OR), the latter of which claimed, “I was initially under the impression that my staff was sharing a copy of the Onion, until I realized this story was, in fact, true.”  Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) also criticized the IRS over the contract in separate comments.  “In the wake of one of the most massive data breaches in a decade, it’s irresponsible for the IRS to turn over millions in taxpayer dollars to a company that has yet to offer a succinct answer on how at least 145 million Americans had personally identifiable information exposed,” declared Sen. Hatch to Politico.  In his own comment, Sen. Wyden added, “The Finance Committee will be looking into why Equifax was the only company to apply for and be rewarded with this. I will continue to take every measure possible to prevent taxpayer data from being compromised as this arrangement moves forward.”  In a statement, the IRS defended their decision, declaring, “Following an internal review and an on-site visit with Equifax, the IRS believes the service Equifax provided does not pose a risk to IRS data or systems.”  “At this time, we have seen no indications of tax fraud related to the Equifax breach, but we will continue to closely monitor the situation,” they proclaimed.  Last month, the U.S. Justice Department reportedly “opened a criminal investigation into the sale of Equifax stock by high-ranking executives just days before the company revealed they had been the subject of a massive data breach,” while Equifax CEO Richard Smith retired from his position a week later.

1658,10/6/17,,12,31,2099,The 4 stories that defined the week,"A political week marked by both tragedy and farce saw President Trump venture from Washington to Puerto Rico and then onward to Las Vegas and back, performing the head of state role that does not always come naturally to him.  But everything is political these days — gun regulation long has been, but competence in hurricane relief is too — and Trump’s travels were deeply marked by controversy. Meanwhile, back home, the president’s team continued to struggle with the politics of tax reform and Trump continued to struggle with the task of managing his own team.  Here’s what you need to know.  Dozens were massacred in Las Vegas  A gunman opened fire on a crowd of concertgoers near the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas with motives that remain obscure days later. More than 50 people were killed and hundreds more injured in what’s now the largest mass shooting in modern American history. And it has reopened the debate over gun regulation.

A perennial counterpoint to the US experience is Australia, where a 1996 mass shooting prompted a huge nationwide crackdown on guns — which delivered big gains in terms of fewer murders and suicides. America is thinking small: In the US, of course, nothing like that is even vaguely under consideration. Instead, there’s some talk that some Republicans might go along with increased regulation on so-called “bump stocks” that give automatic-like capabilities to semiautomatic weapons, and where Republicans may be able to sell heresy on guns as acceptable because it would be correcting a decision by the Obama-era Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to allow them.  Trump flew to Puerto Rico  Trump took a brief trip to still-ravaged Puerto Rico, where he tossed paper towels into a crowd, praised local officials who have praised him, and touted an outdated and almost certainly inaccurate death count.  Emergency conditions still apply: More than two weeks after the hurricane struck, the island’s hospitals are still in emergency triage mode dealing with intermittent generator capacity and supply shortages. Normal life remains at a standstill with more than 90 percent of the island lacking power.

What’s next? Nobody really knows. The White House continues to be at war with the press over criticism of the government’s initial slow response. Longer-term issues like how an already bankrupt island can possibly rebuild while facing a crippling debt burden — or how bondholders can possibly be paid when the island’s infrastructure is in ruins — have barely begun to be discussed.  Tax reform is looking shaky  On Thursday, the House passed a budget resolution that includes reconciliation instructions that could pave the way for a tax bill to pass the Senate with just 50 votes. But even as the House plunged ahead on process, there’s ample sign that on substance, Republicans are far from a consensus.  There’s no real plan: The key issue is that despite months of talk, Republicans leaders haven’t really agreed to anything among themselves on the critical question of whether rate cuts need to be offset by eliminating deductions, and if so, what deductions should go.

Disagreement about the one point of agreement: One thing GOP leaders did all agree on was to eliminate the State and Local Tax (SALT) exemption, but a lot of House Republicans have a problem with this, and several members who voted for the GOP budget resolution say they only did so on the understanding that the SALT proposal would eventually be changed.

And then, of course, someone will have to write a tax bill that actually fleshes out the details. And then there’s the small matter of getting the bill to pass.  Morongate rocked the Cabinet  Long-simmering rumors about Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s discontent at the State Department reached a head with an NBC News report that held that Tillerson had seriously considered resigning and, in frustration, referred to Trump as a “moron” (or perhaps “fucking moron”) after a July 20 meeting with top national security officials. Tillerson then made an odd public statement on Wednesday, denying that he’d ever considered quitting and simply drawing more attention to the question of whether he’d called the president a “moron” (later denied by a spokesperson).",https://www.vox.com/2017/10/6/16431194/stories-defined-week
1669,10/6/17,,12,31,2099,CIA Director Pompeo Proposed as Replacement for Secretary of State Tillerson,"A report published by Axios on Friday cites unspecified sources who say President Donald Trump is considering current CIA Director Mike Pompeo as a replacement for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, whose relationship with Trump is said to be “broken beyond repair.”  According to the “insiders” who spoke to Axios, the last straw for President Trump was that Tillerson did not do enough to push back against the report on Wednesday that Tillerson called the president a “moron” after a Pentagon meeting in July. It was widely noted that while Tillerson organized a hasty press conference to deny that he had to be talked out of resigning his post, he did not actually deny calling Trump a moron. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert did issue such a blanket denial several hours after Tillerson’s presser.  Axios describes Trump as furious over the amount of coverage the “moron” story has received, eclipsing coverage of the president’s trip to Las Vegas. The institutional relationship has soured as well, leaving White House with “zero trust” in the State Department.  Pompeo has been suggested as a replacement because he has an excellent personal relationship with President Trump and already works with him extensively on the President’s Daily Brief, so he could help rebuild that trust.  Pompeo would also be able to rebuild the State Department’s credibility with world leaders, which has reportedly been damaged because no one believes Tillerson is part of the president’s “inner circle” anymore. The insiders who spoke to Axios are confident Pompeo will accept the position if Trump offers it. The primary opponent of the switch appears to be White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, who believes any further high-level staff turnover before the end of the year would destroy the atmosphere of “stability” he has been trying to create.  Another potential stumbling block could be Pompeo’s full plate at the CIA. On Wednesday, he told an intelligence conference at George Washington University that he’s working on reducing red tape at the agency.  “If you are in a process and you’re not adding value, get out of the way,” he said of his approach. “This risk of the absence of agility and speed is a price our agency can’t afford to pay.”  Pompeo said he was trying to get more CIA agents into the field to deal with imminent security threats, improve the agency’s data processing technology, and give station officers more autonomy to make time-critical decisions without consulting Washington. He mentioned during his presentation that President Trump is an “avid consumer” of the intelligence his agency produces.  In mid-September, with rumors swirling that Tillerson might either resign or be fired by the president, Politico reported that Pompeo was one of two favored candidates to replace him, the other being U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley.  “Pompeo, a former congressman, is not seen as eager to leave a job he loves, while Haley has been asserting herself as someone ready for something bigger since she joined the administration,” Politico wrote.  The report further implied that Haley does not have a very good working relationship with Tillerson, refusing to see herself as his subordinate and handling press conferences without approval from Tillerson’s State Department. Haley was described as having a certain degree of policy friction with President Trump that might make Pompeo a better fit as Secretary of State, notably Haley’s more hawkish stance on confronting human-rights abusers and hostile actors like Russia.",http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/10/06/cia-director-pompeo-proposed-replacement-secretary-state-tillerson/

1696,10/5/17,,12,31,2099,A coal miner pension bailout could set the stage for a multi-trillion-dollar taxpayer bailout. Don't do it,"A bipartisan group of federal lawmakers from coal country have introduced an updated bill to use federal taxpayer dollars to pay for the broken promises of one particular coal mining union—the United Mine Workers of America, or UMWA.  If passed, this bill could be the tip of a multi-trillion dollar taxpayer bailout. President Trump, whose sympathy for the miners is well known, should beware, along with Congress.  That’s because the UMWA is not the only pension plan that has made promises to its workers and failed to set aside the funds to keep those promises. Out of nearly 1,400 union-run or “multiemployer” pension plans across the U.S., 85 percent of them are less than 70 percent funded, and they have promised $500 billion more than they can pay.  The second proposed “funding” mechanism is a taxpayer loan to the insolvent pension plan—which is no different than a straight-up bailout. When there’s virtually no chance of repayment, that’s not a “secure loan.”  State and local public pension plans, such as those for teachers and firefighters, have promised another $5 trillion more than they set aside to pay.  Proponents of a UMWA bailout claim that the costs will be covered in part by existing government funds, especially the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Fund, but that’s simply not true. A Congressional Research Service report confirms that there’s no money left in the fund, as the UMWA has already tapped every last available cent to cover its unfunded health care promises.  The second proposed “funding” mechanism is a taxpayer loan to the insolvent pension plan—which is no different than a straight-up bailout. This is like a bank providing a 30-year loan to homeowners who are in foreclosure and whose incomes cover only 10 percent of their mortgage costs. When there’s virtually no chance of repayment, that’s not a “secure loan.”  Overall, the UMWA has racked up $5.6 billion in unfunded pension promises. It has only one person paying into the pension fund for every seven retirees receiving benefits, and for every dollar that leaves its pension fund, it collects less than 16 cents in new contributions.  How can taxpayers expect that the UMWA will be able to repay its loans with an income and balance sheet like that?  Although the decline in the coal industry—due in no small part to excessive Obama-era regulations—exacerbated the UMWA’s pension problem, it is in no way the cause. After all, if private companies go out of business, their workers’ 401(k) accounts don’t lose value or disappear completely.  The problem with the UMWA and many other union-run and public sector pension plans across the country is that those who promised future retirement benefits didn’t set aside the funds necessary to pay them.  When the UMWA fund was first established in 1946, the UMWA fought vehemently to pay out pension benefits the very next year, to workers who never earned them. And in the seven decades since, the UMWA has consistently failed to set aside the money needed to make good on the promises it made to hard-working coalminers.  So what happens if Congress doesn’t step in to bail out the UMWA’s unfunded pension promises?  The same thing that has and continues to happen to all other union-run pension plans that become insolvent.  The government’s Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC)—not a taxpayer-financed government entity—steps in and begins paying workers their insured benefits. Those are typically less than workers would have received if their union plans had been able to keep their promises. The average UMWA pensioner who receives about $530 per month would have their check reduced by about 10 percent, or $50 per month.  The PBGC is already paying benefits to retirees of more than 50 failed union-run pension plans, with another 60 plans “booked” within the PBGC because of their near certain short-term failure. Politicians didn’t seek taxpayer bailouts on behalf of any of these pension plans, perhaps because they weren’t as big or politically powerful as the UMWA.  Never before in history has the U.S. government bailed out a private or public sector pension plan. Unless Congress is prepared to force taxpayers to bail out trillions of dollars in unfunded pension promises across the country—and set the precedent that employers can promise whatever they want in future pension benefits without having to make good on those promises—this is a line policymakers should not cross, even for an iconic, beleaguered industry like coal.",http://www.foxnews.com//opinion/2017/10/05/coal-miner-pension-bailout-could-set-stage-for-multi-trillion-dollar-taxpayer-bailout-dont-do-it.html
1703,10/7/17,,12,31,2099,How to stop ads from following you online,"Is this just a coincidence? You recently looked at cameras online, and now you’re seeing ads for cameras. You were browsing new outfits, and now your browser is showing ads for shirts and trousers.  Not long ago, “interest-based advertising” creeped out a lot of people who couldn’t understand why Facebook, for example, knew what they had just shopped for on Amazon. The truth is that personalized ads are the result of a very impersonal process.  Interest-based advertising crunches bits of data gathered from your browser to make marketing more efficient. Special algorithms analyze your visits over time and across different websites, making it possible to predict your preferences and show ads that are likely to interest you.  But sometimes, all this tracking can be overwhelming. While the process is basically automatic and unmanned, interest-based ads can feel like an invasion of privacy. That’s why many people look for ways to throw the trackers off their scent.  Here are three simple ways to do just that.  1. Wipe out history, turn off cookies  To start, you’ll want a clean slate. You should eliminate any trace of your past searches by clearing all the browsing data, history, cache and cookies from your web browsers.  Next, disable or limit tracking on your gadget, including on favorite services like Facebook. If you’re not sure how how to do this, click here for the steps to wipe out where you’ve been and what you’ve done. Next, make sure to delete third-party advertising cookies. Click here to learn how to remove them and prevent them from coming back.  When you’re finished, take a moment to test your browser with an online security and privacy checker. I like the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s tool that shows you the information about the browser you’re using and your risk level. Click here for the free download and more details.  2. Opt out of ads  You may notice only a handful of culprits, but many companies use algorithms to track your behavior and send you targeted ads.  Thankfully, there’s a way for you to opt out of interest-based, or “behavioral,” ads. The Digital Advertising Alliance lets you review its participating partners. When you first visit the DAA, the websites will scan your computer. Once the scan is complete, you’ll be shown a list of partners advertising directly to you.  From there, you can learn more about the practices these companies use for interest-based ads. You can opt out using “opt-out cookies” that are stored in your browser with your preferences.  Click here for the steps to opt-out of this form of online targeted advertising.  3. Go incognito  Every major web browser — Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari and Opera — has private, or incognito, browsing. Turning this feature on means your browser will ignore cookies, including ad-tracking cookies, and your computer won’t record your browsing history. It’s almost like you were never online.  When your browser is in private browsing mode, it will show a special icon. In Firefox, it’s a mask; in Chrome, it’s a little spy; in Edge, it’s “InPrivate.” These all indicate that you’re in incognito or private mode.  Private browsing will keep your computer safe from casual snoopers. Someone who jumps on your computer won’t see where you’ve been.  Learn more about private browsing as well as anonymous tools at my website.  Keep in mind that online ads aren’t necessarily a bad thing. Yes, they can annoy us, but they’re also the reason most online content is free. Without them, media outlets and content creators would have to find a different source of revenue. For most of us, seeing a few presumptuous ads is a tiny price to pay.  What questions do you have? Call my national radio show and click here to find it on your local radio station.

1705,10/6/17,,12,31,2099,"New type of microscope can peer into the brain of a living, moving creature","Its not every day that scientists invent a whole new type of microscope, but thats exactly what researchers in Germany have achieved with a new project. A collaboration between Helmholtz Zentrum Mnchen, Technical University of Munich, the Department of Nuclear Medicine, and Munich School of Bioengineering, the so-called NeuBtracker is an open source microscope that allows people to observe neuronal activities in the brain of a zebrafish larvae without affecting its behavior.  Thats exciting for scientists who want to better understand the brain because it makes it possible to look at how neurons behave, while at the same time tracking natural behavior. The results could have serious implications for everything from building more brain-like computers to testing out drugs.  NeuBtracker works by synchronizing two cameras, Gil Westmeyer, a professor at Helmholtz Zentrum Mnchen, told Digital Trends. One looks at the entire arena in which the larvae are freely swimming and measures the position, speed, velocity, as well as tail and fin movements of the larva; the other camera stays centered on the brain of the zebrafish and provides a magnified view of the fluorescence signals showing the brain activity. This tracking of the brain by the fluorescence camera is achieved via a galvanometric mirror system that obtains the information on the position and likely swimming direction of the larva from the first camera. Importantly, NeuBtracker thus works without moving stages, objectives or light beams, which may be perceived by the larvae and perturb their natural behavior.    Because zebrafish are vertebrates, they share important features with the body plan of humans, although their neuronal circuits are much simpler than our own. That gives researchers the chance to understand how specific sets of stimuli are converted into behaviors by certain neuronal networks in the larval brain. These could be used to extract principles regarding which network architectures and patterns of network activity can support different types of computation.  Dr. Antonella Lauri  We hope that the open source instrument NeuBtracker will be applied, adapted, and improved by other laboratories in the world to study these fundamental research questions by enabling simultaneous neuro and behavioral imaging across the entire nervous system in an intact organism, Westmeyer continued. Another more applied line of research that NeuBtracker empowers is to screen for the combined effects of pharmacological compounds on the behavior and brain activity simultaneously. Since zebrafish larvae are swimming in water, such screens can be conducted very efficiently and can provide important filters and initial hypotheses on which compounds may have desired neuroactive effects that could be further tested for future medical applications.  A paper describing the work was recently published in the journal Nature Methods.",http://www.foxnews.com//tech/2017/10/06/new-type-microscope-can-peer-into-brain-living-moving-creature.html
1718,10/7/17,,12,31,2099,ANGRY LIBERAL STORE OWNER Gets Slammed For Using Billboard To Display Image of Trump as Hitler…Asks Liberals To Attack Billboard Owner For Taking It Down  ,"Nicholle Haber Lewis has a clothing and accessory resale store in Chico, CA. Lewis thought it would be a great idea to post an image depicting the President of the United States as Hitler, to help promote her store. Nicholle Haber Lewis didn’t count, however, on the backlash, she’d receive for placing her vile and hateful message on a billboard in an area that is populated by mostly conservatives.  Things didn’t go as well as Nicholle had hoped…and now, she’s lashing out at the owner of the billboard company who was inundated with calls from angry residents.  Rouse & Revolt owner Nicholle Lewis told Newsweek that she didn’t sleep much last night. Her phone wouldn’t stop going off with the persistent buzzing of death threats for her sign, which stylizes the number 45 into a swastika and features Trump posed in a Hitler-esque stance.    “I’m living in a small, podunk red town and I’m already getting death threats,” said Lewis, whose store is in right-leaning Chico, population 90,000. “My business has completely floundered. Overnight I had more one-star reviews than all the reviews I’ve received in a year.”        *    Email *  Name      The sign was up for less than 24 hours before Stott Outdoor Advertising took it down amid a backlash that featured online attacks.  But Lewis said she’s standing behind her beliefs.  “I don’t necessarily think that just because I’m a business doesn’t mean I can’t mix my beliefs,” Lewis said. “That’s a common misconception that you can’t mix politics and business. … I have a platform and I’m going to use it.”  Lewis has used the billboard at the corner of Third Avenue and Mangrove Avenue all year, though this is the first time she’s made it political.  “He is not presidential, he is not a president,” Lewis said. “He is a celebrity who was born into money. And he’s a Nazi sympathizer. I am going to stand behind my beliefs regardless.”  Lewis said she has been getting some support, too.  Lewis got slammed by bad reviews on her store, Rouse and Revolt Facebook page, as well as her personal Facebook page, where she posted this video. In the video, Lewis pleas with liberals to make false claims against the sign company, as a payback because she’s been hit with bad reviews. That’s called liberal logic, in case you’re not familiar with how liberal operate.  Watch, as angry liberal Nicholle Haber Lewis threatens the sign company with a lawsuit while simultaneously asking libs to help her destroy his business.  Posted by Nicholle Haber Lewis on Friday, October 6, 2017  The general manager of Stott Outdoor Advertising replied to Newsweek:  Jim Moravec, the general manager of Stott Outdoor Advertising, told Newsweek that the company took it down because “a lot of people misinterpreted the billboard and who the speaker was.”  “I should have not accepted the ad in the first place,” Moravec said, adding that the sign looked more like a call for action than an ad for the clothing store. – Newsweek",https://100percentfedup.com/angry-liberal-store-owner-gets-slammed-using-billboard-display-image-trump-hitlerasks-liberals-attack-billboard-owner-taking-video/
1736,10/3/17,,12,31,2099,"Cal Thomas: Tax reform, history, and math","In school, I liked math the least and history the most. Both can be useful in the coming debate over President Trump’s proposed tax reforms.  The one thing I learned in math class is that if the formula is wrong, the answer will be wrong. In history class I learned we are not the first people to occupy the planet and that the experiences of those who came before us can be helpful when considering contemporary issues.  Since the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the left has presented government as the answer to every problem. The increasing taxes needed to finance that whimsy saddles hardworking taxpayers with the burden of paying a modern-day version of Roman tribute to inept rulers never satisfied with the amount. Failure, of course, never seems to be a reason to slow government growth, much less reduce its size and reach. For the left, any failure is attributed to the evil rich who don’t pay enough.  President Trump should start reading the indecipherable tax code aloud at public events and say, “This is what your Congress has done to you.”  There is another formula which, when tried, has succeeded. It worked for John F. Kennedy, who cut taxes; ditto for Ronald Reagan (yes, he also raised taxes but by then economic growth was such that they did not have a negative effect).  And it worked for Calvin Coolidge whose philosophy, life and presidency has much to teach us today, but those addicted to government need to go to rehab to break their reliance on Washington and improve their lives.  In Robert Sobel’s biography, “Coolidge: An American Enigma,” these quotes from the 30th president are highlighted: “I am convinced that the larger incomes of the country would actually yield more revenue to the government if the basis of taxation were scientifically revised downward.”  That was Reagan’s belief long before “supply-side economics” acquired its name.  Then there is this Coolidgeism: “I want the people of America to be able to work less for the government and more for themselves. I want them to have the rewards of their own industry. That is the chief meaning of freedom. Until we can re-establish a condition under which the earnings of the people can be kept by the people, we are bound to suffer a very distinct curtailment of our liberty.”  About public debt, which has just passed $20 trillion and would have appalled him, Coolidge said: “Public debt (is) a burden on all the people.” Coolidge left office with a surplus.  Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., has brought out the familiar liberal playbook, demonizing the “rich” and claiming they will benefit most from any tax cut. People who have acquired their wealth honestly through hard work and wise decisions should be role models, not demonized as if they have stolen from others.  President Trump should start reading the indecipherable tax code aloud at public events and say, “This is what your Congress has done to you.” He should bring people on stage to tell their stories of how high taxes have harmed, even ruined, their businesses. These should include people who have lost family farms handed down through generations because of the estate, or “death tax,” which forced them to sell the land in order to pay the government.  Public testimonies can be more effective than debating economic philosophy.  Washington always assumes we aren’t sending it enough of the money we earn. President Trump should say we are going to start telling Washington how much of our money we intend to let them spend.  The left hasn’t had a new economic idea in 70 years. Its old idea of more taxation and spending is the wrong formula, and it’s producing harmful results. History can show us a better way. We can start with Coolidge.",http://www.foxnews.com//opinion/2017/10/03/cal-thomas-tax-reform-history-and-math.html
1737,10/8/17,,12,31,2099,Trump Backs Away from Promise to Move U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem,"President Donald Trump told former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee in an interview broadcast on TBN Saturday that he would not move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem until he had tried to broker peace between Israel and the Palestinians.  The statement marks a significant walk-back of Trump’s campaign promise in 2016 to relocate the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem “fairly quickly.”  In March 2016, in a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a prominent pro-Israel lobby group, Trump committed to moving the embassy to Jerusalem, explaining that it would increase the chance of peace with the Palestinians:  But when the United States stands with Israel, the chances of peace really rise and rises exponentially. That’s what will happen when Donald Trump is president of the United States. We will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem. And we will send a clear signal that there is no daylight between America and our most reliable ally, the state of Israel. The Palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the United States and Israel is absolutely, totally unbreakable. They must come to the table willing and able to stop the terror being committed on a daily basis against Israel. They must do that. And they must come to the table willing to accept that Israel is a Jewish state and it will forever exist as a Jewish state.  In his interview with Huckabee, Trump appeared to dump that logic in favor of the conventional wisdom that the chances for peace would be hurt by affirming Israel’s sovereignty in Jerusalem.  Huckabee: Ambassador [David] Friedman recently indicated that the embassy will be moved to Jerusalem. Do we have a timeframe? Trump: Well, we’re going to make a decision in the not-too-distant future. Right now, we are actually working on a plan that everybody says will never work — because for many, many years, it’s never worked, they say it’s the toughest deal of all, is peace between Israel and the Palestinians. So we’re going to work that, and if that doesn’t work — which is possible that it won’t, to be totally honest, I mean most people say it’s an impossible deal. I don’t think it is impossible, and I think it’s something that can happen. And I think it’s something that — I’m not making any predictions, but I want to give that a shot before I even think about moving the embassy to Jerusalem.  Trump appears to consider the embassy move a punitive measure, one that Palestinians can forestall by indulging peace talks. The implication is that an embassy move might not be included within the framework of a peace deal, and that Palestinians might not be required to recognize Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem in a peace agreement.

1756,Muf,,12,31,2099,Is There Any Reason Not to Get a Flu Shot?,"Q. Is there any reason someone should not get a flu shot?  A. Health officials urge all Americans 6 months and older to get an annual flu shot — except for those who have ever had a severe or life-threatening allergic reaction to an influenza vaccine or vaccine component. Individuals who have had severe allergic reactions to a flu vaccine “should not get the vaccine again,” said Dr. Lisa Grohskopf, a medical officer with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  For years, people with egg allergies were also warned to avoid flu shots, since eggs were used to help make the vaccine. But the current recommendation is to go ahead and be vaccinated, Dr. Grohskopf said. Though eggs may still be used in the manufacturing process, the amount of egg protein present in the vaccine is so small it is unlikely to cause a reaction, Dr. Grohskopf said. Even when someone has a severe egg allergy, she said, “we still recommend they be vaccinated, but have it done in a medical setting with a provider present, who can recognize and manage an emergency reaction.” Influenza vaccination is also recommended during pregnancy, to protect both the mother and baby.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/well/live/is-there-any-reason-not-to-get-a-flu-shot.html
1763,Muf,,12,31,2099,This cartoon explains why predicting a mass shooting is impossible,"In the wake of mass shootings, many people wonder how they could have been prevented. Were there warning signs that should have been heeded? Was the person mentally ill? Did he or she hold extremist views?  It’s a question we’re bound to ask after awful attacks like the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 dead. President Donald Trump’s response, in part, was to call for increased focus on mental health care to potentially prevent similar attacks. (Though, as Dylan Matthews explains, it’s largely a myth that poor mental health is associated with mass violence.)  The sad truth is that the only personal factors that reliably correlate with mass shooters are being young and being male. There are a lot of angsty young men in this country. That makes prediction hard.  But what makes prediction even harder is just how rare these instances of mass shooting are. Yes, America has a gun violence problem. But the vast majority of people will never commit such a crime. Even if we said one in a million people will become mass murderers, that would be too high an estimate. There are 323 million people in the United States.  The fact that there are so few mass shooters and so many more harmless people makes it actually mathematically impossible to predict who might become a mass shooter.  New York magazine’s Jesse Singal made this point after the shooting at Umpqua Community College in 2015. “It would be nice to think we could sidestep the gun-control issues,” he wrote, and focus on quantifying the mental health and behavioral warning signs in would-be shooters.  But that would be an exercise in futility. Last year, Sanjay Srivastava, a psychologist at the University of Oregon, walked us through a thought experiment to consider.  ”Even with very good detection procedures, when you’re talking about rare events, [prediction models] do not work the way you might think,” he said.  Even a prediction model that’s 99 percent accurate would be of no use.  Let’s see why.  Imagine scientists invent a machine that can predict who will commit an act of terrorism or mass murder  This is science fiction, clearly. But if we could invent such a machine, we’d want it to analyze the intricate regions of a person’s brain and then determine his intent and willingness to commit a mass crime.  In addition to mind reading, we’d want it to track a person’s online behavior, social connections, and purchasing decisions and use that data to determine who is a would-be mass killer.  For the purposes of this example, let’s assume it works absurdly well.  This machine is 99 percent accurate  This 99 percent accuracy is also science fiction. We’re not even that good at predicting the weather, let alone the complexities of human behavior.  But you’d have faith in a system that was 99 percent accurate, wouldn’t you?  It would mean that it would correctly identify mass shooters 99 percent of the time and correctly identify peaceful citizens 99 percent of the time.  This sounds pretty good. Let’s see how well it analyzes 100,000 people.  Let’s assume that there’s actually one future mass shooter lurking in this group of 100,000 people.  The machine is 99 percent accurate, so it labels 99 percent of these “harmless” people correctly. Hooray!  More good news: The machine should also theoretically correctly identify the mass shooter.  So from our initial group of 100,000 people, we’re left with a list of 1,001 potential mass shooters  What? I thought this thing was 99 percent accurate! What junk!  Well, it is 99 percent accurate. But that means it will falsely label one out of every 100 people a mass shooter.  In a group of 100,000 people, we’d be left with 1,001 potential mass shooters: 1,000 false positives and one correct guess.  It’s likely the machine did correctly guess who the mass shooter will be. But he’s hidden among the false positives.  If we ran this machine on all US citizens, it would identify around 3.2 million people as mass shooters  What does the government do with this information? Monitor all 3.2 million potential killers? Wiretap all their homes?  This isn’t feasible.  In the wake of the horrendous shooting in Norway in 2011 that left more than 70 people dead, the Swedish Defense Research Agency looked into whether it would be possible to monitor social media to identify would-be mass shooters. Here’s what the agency wrote in a 2014 paper:  To produce fully automatic computer tools for detecting lone wolf terrorists on the Internet is, in our view, not possible, both due to the enormous amounts of data (which is only partly indexed by search engines) and due to the deep knowledge that is needed to really understand what is discussed or expressed in written text or other kinds of data available on the Internet, such as videos or images.  The lesson here is that it’s much easier to look backward and assume the warning signs were there and could have been spotted.  ”But that’s going the wrong way — it’s hindsight, not prediction,” Srivastava said.  ”Spend some time online and realize just how many young men there are saying angry things on the internet. Which ones are really dangerous, and which ones are just exercising their constitutional right to say angry things? The math just isn’t on your side.”  Prediction won’t work, so what will? Well, there’s an answer, but it’s not going to make a lot of people happy. Considering the mathematical hurdles of predicting killers, maybe stricter gun control is actually the easier option to reduce gun violence.",https://www.vox.com/2016/6/15/11934794/cartoon-predicting-a-mass-shooting-mathematically-impossible
1771,Muf,,12,31,2099,North Korea: What would a nuclear attack look like?,"One single reliable warhead fired by North Korea could destroy densely populated cities, killing millions.  Those who aren’t killed in a nuclear blast would be left with devastating injuries while their cities would be flattened with vital infrastructure destroyed.  A detailed analysis by 38 North, at the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, has revealed what would happen if Kim Jong-un did the unthinkable and actually fired a nuclear weapon.  In A Hypothetical Nuclear Attack on Seoul and Tokyo: The Human Cost of War on the Korean Peninsula, Michael J Zagurek paints a terrifying picture of the damage it could cause.  Assuming North Korea has 25 operational nuclear weapons with warhead yield ranges from 15 to 250 kilotons timed for airburst at optimal altitude, Zagurek runs through seven different scenarios.  The warhead yield ranges are based on current and possible future capabilities and the estimates of casualties were also based on the size of the city and population density.  In the most extreme estimate of a 250kt weapon being used, Seoul and Incheon which has a combined population of 24,105,000 would have 783,197 fatalities, and 2,778,009 injuries.  Tokyo and Yokohama with a combined population of 37,900,000 would have 697,665 fatalities and 2,474,627 injuries.  Maps showing four blast areas from a 250 kt airburst detonation also show how far the fallout and blast would reach.  North Korea has launched 98 ballistic missiles since 2011, including 19 this year.  However it remains unclear exactly how many warheads it possesses and how advanced they are.  Nuclear disarmament campaigner John Hallam said the analysis was fairly authoritative.  Mr Hallam speculated the DPRK (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) had between 40 and 60 warheads.  He also said he believed it will be a while before North Korea hit its nuclear goals.  “I’m also inclined to think that it will be a while before they fit a 250Kt warhead to more than one or two rockets,” he said.  “So 38 North analysis being based to a large extent on smaller warheads is not unreasonable — but the number of larger warheads will clearly rise over time.”  Mr Hallam said it was reasonable to assume Seoul and Tokyo were obvious targets but the analysis didn’t include an ability to strike US west coast cities.  “If that ability does exist, then it’s also possible for them to strike Sydney, which doesn’t mean they necessarily will — the highest priority target in Australia, indeed almost in the world — is Pine Gap, critical for US command and control,” he said.  “If US cities become part of the equation which they will in a year or two if they are not now, then that body count will be higher.”  He also pointed out the analysis didn’t take into account US President Donald Trump’s threat to wipe out the DPRK, which would increase the body count even further.  Mr Hallam said there would also be fallout which would also add to the huge casualty toll.  “It would be necessary to take into account the effects of fallout drifting in one direction all over South Korea, and in the other direction, into Manchuria,” he said.  “Maybe once Seoul has been leveled, which can be done without use of nukes at all, a little fallout from the rubble bouncing in the DPRK is of lesser consequence, but it needs to be taken into account somehow.”  Meanwhile Mr Trump said his administration’s goal was for North Korea to denuclearise.  “We cannot allow this dictatorship to threaten our nation or our allies with unimaginable loss of life,” he said.  “We will do what we must do to prevent that from happening. And it will be done, if necessary, believe me.”  The President had been discussing Iran and North Korea with US military leaders and posed for a photo with them before declaring the moment “the calm before the storm”.  “You guys know what this represents?” Mr Trump said after journalists gathered in the White House state dining room to photograph him and First Lady Melania Trump with the uniformed military leaders and their spouses.  “Maybe it’s the calm before the storm,” he said.  When asked what storm, Mr Trump replied: “You’ll find out.”  - with Reuters  This story originally appeared in news.com.au.",http://www.foxnews.com//tech/2017/10/09/north-korea-what-would-nuclear-attack-look-like.html
1773,Muf,,12,31,2099,The placebo effect has an evil twin that makes you feel pain,"The placebo effect is one of the most mystifying phenomena in medicine. When we expect a pill to make us feel better, it does. If we see others get better while using a medicine, we will too.  Doctors even see a placebo response in patients who are told they are on a placebo. And the more invasive, expensive, and drastic the placebo intervention, the greater the healing effect. Fake surgeries — where doctors make some incisions but don’t actually change anything — make people feel better than placebo pills alone.  But the placebo effect has an evil twin: the nocebo. It can kick in when negative expectations steer our experience of symptoms and create side effects where none should occur.  This means, incredibly, that you can get side effects from a sugar pill. And sometimes these side effects are so severe that patients drop out of clinical trials, as a 2013 paper in Nature Reviews explains. A review of fibromyalgia drug trials revealed that 72 percent of people who left the trial did so because they felt severe side effects while on placebo.  Or take statins, the most prescribed class of drug in America. They work to lower blood cholesterol and help prevent heart attacks. But people commonly report muscle aches while on the drug. Sometimes the aches are painful enough that people stop taking the drugs, which then puts them at risk for heart disease. Evidence suggests that the muscle aches might be a big nocebo.  There’s been a lot of recent scientific work trying to find ways to maximize the placebo effect, so that doctors can squeeze out the maximum therapeutic benefit from drugs. But scientists are also learning there are ways to minimize or maximize the nocebo effect too.  A fascinating October study in Science shows one possible way: When patients are led to believe one drug is less expensive than another, they’re also less likely to report painful side effects.  How expensive-looking packaging can alter perception of side effects  In the experiment published in Science, participants were told they were taking part in a study to test out a new anti-itch cream. They were also told the anti-itch cream had the side effect of making people more sensitive to heat.  The experimenters wondered: Could they manipulate the power of the nocebo effect, and make participants feel more or less pain after using the cream by priming them with an expectation?  In placebo studies, more expensive, involved procedures in which participants are aware of the higher cost and complexity tend to produce a higher placebo response. The researchers here wondered if the same applied to nocebo.  Half the participants were led to believe the drug was expensive. How: It came in a sleek blue packaging and was called “Solestan” — reminiscent of the expensive brand-name drugs you may see advertised on TV.  The other half of the participants were led to believe they were testing an inexpensive generic cream called “Imotadil-LeniPharma Creme,” which came in ugly orange-and-white packaging. It’s giving me a rash just looking at it.  A survey found that the participants did, indeed, rate the blue-packaged drug as costing more than the one in the stripped-down packaging. But in reality, both creams were the same placebo schmear, which contained no active drug whatsoever.  To test the side effect question, the researchers spread some cream on the participants’ arms. Then they hooked up that patch of skin to a device that delivered some mild heat. To fool the participants, they also hooked up another patch of untreated skin to the same machine. But they only turned up the heat on the patch of skin that had the cream. This trick was to ensure that the participants believed they were experiencing the side effect.  Then the trials began. Participants in both the expensive and inexpensive cream groups were exposed to the exact same levels of heat. The scientists kept asking: How much did that hurt?  There was a big, clear, unmistakable difference. The participants who had the “expensive” cream thought it hurt a lot more.  And what’s more: The effect increased over time. The more participants used the “expensive” cream — the more trials they underwent in the study — the more pain they felt.  How is this possible?  Like the placebo effect, the nocebo effect is influenced by expectations. And that’s what the researchers think is happening here. People guess a more expensive medication should be more potent and lead to more skin problems.  “The most likely explanation is that participants infer that expensive medication contains a more potent and effective agent and, consequently, produces more side effects,” the researchers conclude.  Some researchers suspect the nocebo effect is partly fueling the gluten-free diet fad. People have developed a negative expectation that eating gluten will make them feel bad. And so it does, even though they may not have any biological gluten sensitivity.  What researchers have realized in the past two decades is that the placebo and nocebo effects don’t just change how we talk about symptoms. Neuroscience studies find evidence that they actually change the way we perceive pain in the brain. And that’s what the researchers in this latest Science paper found too. An fMRI scan of the participants’ brains and spinal cords (which processes our pain response) provided evidence that not only were these participants saying they felt more pain, but they were experiencing it differently too.  Given the real therapeutic power of the placebo effect, there’s been a small but growing thread of research looking into whether it can be harnessed to help treat diseases. It’s surprisingly promising. Through placebo conditioning, it may be possible to maintain the same level of drug effectiveness while taking less of the drug. Overall, this research forces doctors to consider that the context in which medicine is given can make a big difference in how people feel.  But it’s still hard to know the best way to harness the placebo effect and downplay the nocebo effect. This Science study shows the healing power of the placebo isn’t limitless — because where placebo lurks, nocebo may lurk too.",https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/10/9/16435802/nocebo-effect-medicine-placebo
1803,Muf,,12,31,2099,"Columbus Memory Still Honored in Nation’s Capitol, Groups ‘On the Offensive’ to Defend his Legacy","Patriotic American organizations carried on the tradition, dating back to 1912, of honoring the memory of the discoverer of the New World at the Columbus Monument outside Washington, DC’s, Union Station, Monday.  The political climate surrounding the federal Columbus Day holiday and the memory of the man who sailed across the Atlantic did nothing to dampen the spirit of those who gathered to mark his achievements and significance.  “The only thing different was the weather,” J.P. McCusker, President of the National Christopher Columbus Association (NCCA) told  News, downplaying the impact of the recent controversies over Columbus’s legacy.  McCusker was also unfazed by calls by Antifa and other left-wing groups to disrupt what they wish to re-christen “Indigenous Peoples’ Day,” despite Park Service Police having told him they were stepping up security around Washington in light of recent vandalism incidents. “They’re trying to take history and rewrite it … they’re trying to make the heroes of yesterday the villains of today,” McCusker said of Columbus Day opponents.  The NCCA played the leading role in putting on the annual ceremony and was joined by, among others, the National Park Service, the Knights of Columbus, the Order Sons of Italy in America, the National Italian American Foundation, and the National Society Daughters of the American Revolution.  Statements were given by President Donald Trump and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser in recognition and support of the Columbus Day holiday for the crowd in front of the monument. A local Fairfax County, Virginia, high schooler read her contest-winning essay on hardships Columbus faced on his history-changing voyage without the benefit of modern maritime technology. The groups involved, as well as the ambassadors of Italy and Spain, where Columbus began his journey, later laid wreaths.  In recent weeks, the NCCA felt it necessary to launch a new website defending the legacy of Columbus in light of the escalation of the far-left’s campaign against traditional American history. McCusker told  News there was a “marked increase” in anti-Columbus agitation. “Columbus has been coming under attack for the last few years,” he said. “The oldest statue of Columbus in the world, in Baltimore, was vandalized, and we see other statues being vandalized.”  “We wanted to take the offensive. In years gone by we’ve been on the defensive,” McCusker explained. “When they’re accusing Columbus of genocide? He didn’t commit genocide. He’s accused of starting slavery.

President Trump Offers Congress Hard-Line Deal On Immigration…Shines Spotlight On Democrats' Agenda To Put Votes Before American Citizens ,"If Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer were under the impression that they were leading the negotiations on DACA, the border wall and issues related to illegal immigration, that all changed today. The Democrats failure to protect our nation from criminals and terrorists, and to protect the earnings of hard-working Americans, will be laid bare for all to see if they don’t agree to President Trump’s latest proposal to Congress.  AP– President Donald Trump has told congressional leaders that his hard-line immigration priorities must be enacted in exchange for extending protection from deportation to hundreds of thousands of young immigrants, many of whom were brought to the U.S. illegally as children.  Trump’s list of demands included overhauling the country’s green-card system, a crackdown on unaccompanied minors entering the country, and building his promised wall along the southern border.    Many were policies Democrats have said explicitly are off the table and threaten to derail ongoing negotiations over legislation protecting young immigrants known as “Dreamers.” They had been given a reprieve from deportation and the ability to work legally in the country under President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which Trump ended last month.        *    Email *  Name      In a letter to House and Senate leaders released by the White House Sunday, Trump said the priorities were the product of a “a bottom-up review of all immigration policies” that he had ordered “to determine what legislative reforms are essential for America’s economic and national security.  “These findings outline reforms that must be included as part of any legislation addressing the status of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients,” he wrote, adding that: “Without these reforms, illegal immigration and chain migration, which severely and unfairly burden American workers and taxpayers, will continue without end.”  Trump announced last month that he was ending the DACA program, but he gave Congress six months to come up with a legislative fix before recipients began to lose their status. Trump suggested at the time that he was eager for a deal, telling reporters, “I have a love for these people and hopefully now Congress will be able to help them and do it properly.”  He’d also tweeted that if Congress was unwilling to find a fix, he would “revisit this issue!” in six months. –",https://100percentfedup.com/brilliant-president-trump-offers-congress-hard-line-deal-immigrationshines-spotlight-democrats-agenda-put-votes-american-citizens/

Kaepernick kneeled to try to bring attention to the plight of Black Lives Matter, a group who’s placed a target on the backs of law enforcement, claiming they unfairly single out and target blacks. LaCanfora spoke on NFL Today host “J.B.” or James Brown about where Colin Kaepernick is today, and why he has remained silent during his quest to find a job in the NFL.  LaCanfora told J.B. that Kaepernick is “not planning on kneeling. He’s going to donate all of his sales from his jersey’s and he’s planning on standing for the anthems if given the opportunity to play again, J.B..”  After sitting down with Colin Kaepernick for several hours, @JasonLaCanfora says the QB is still actively trying to play in the NFL. pic.twitter.com/R9qTIZ7EQl — NFLonCBS (@NFLonCBS) October 8, 2017        *            When the news broke that Kaepernick was planning to stand for the anthem if he got a job working in the NFL again (where he could make millions of dollars), all hell broke loose on social media.  LaCanfora quickly attempted to retract what he clearly said during the interview.  Either CBS has removed LaCanfora’s story because it was deemed to be FAKE NEWS, or they just don’t want to cross the left by publishing a story that would completely discredit the Black Lives Matter movement, that has NFL players kneeling on the field and disrespecting our flag, when Colin Kaepernick, the guy who started the whole movement, is saying he’s willing to give it up if he can just be paid millions to play football again.

1842,Muf,,12,31,2099,"Trump Tower meeting wasn't about Clinton 'dirt,' emails show","Email correspondence revealed Monday about a July 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian attorney at Trump Tower in New York City contradict previous reports.  The messages suggest that the meeting was not set up to pass on damaging information about Hillary Clinton on behalf of the Russian government.  Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya believed she was meeting President Donald Trump’s oldest son to discuss the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 sanction law aimed at top Russian officials, and did not have information on behalf of the Kremlin to pass on to the Trump campaign, according to the emails.  In an email chain between music publicist Rob Goldstone and Veselnitskaya, she asks to invite Russian-born lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin to the meeting, saying he was “working to advance these issues with several congressmen,” the Wall Street Journal reported.  “He has invaluable knowledge about the positions held by the members of the Foreign Relations Committee that will be important to our discussion,” she adds. Akhmetshin has worked to overturn the Magnitsky Act.  Following a New York Times report in July, Trump Jr. was accused of taking the meeting, organized by Goldstone, knowing that the attorney had damaging information on Clinton coming from the Russian government.  Goldstone said at the time that he could set up a meeting to provide “very high level and sensitive information” compromising Clinton’s election chances as part of “Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.”  “If it’s what you say, I love it,” Trump Jr. wrote in response to the request for the meeting.  Following the controversy, Don Jr. defended himself, saying Veselnitskaya did not have any information and in fact wanted to focus on other non-election-related issues. She echoed his view on multiple occasions, saying the Magnitsky Act -- a U.S. attempt to punish Russian officials after the death of a whistleblower -- had always been the reason for the meeting.  The emails were released by Scott Balber, an attorney for Aras Agalarov, who helped to organize the meeting with Trump Jr.  Balber said the emails were released to contradict Goldstone’s remarks and bolster the case that the meeting in fact had nothing to do with the Kremlin’s attempt to collude with the Trump campaign.  He also told the Journal that the Russian lawyer has been fighting the Magnitsky Act for years and reached out to numerous Russian authorities.  As part of her effort against the sanction law, she had a five-page set of talking points, including one reference to Clinton, suggesting a U.S. company, Ziff Brothers Investments, had avoided taxes in Russia and donated to the Democratic Party, possibly Clinton.",http://www.foxnews.com//politics/2017/10/11/trump-tower-meeting-wasnt-about-clinton-dirt-emails-show.html

How quickly things changed for the billionaire mega-Democrat donor and Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. Just a few days ago, Harvey Weinstein was telling reporters that his wife, mother of his young children and designer, Georgina Chapman, was 100% behind him. It only took 3 rape allegations, multiple sexual assault accusations and his firing from his own company for his wife, the designer who is allegedly already fretting about the effects this pig will have on her business to leave him.  Harvey Weinstein’s wife, Georgina Chapman, has announced that she is leaving the movie mogul after a string of woman claimed that he had sexually harassed or assaulted her.  ‘My heart breaks for all the women who have suffered tremendous pain because of these unforgivable actions. I have chosen to leave my husband,’ she told People.    ‘Caring for my young children is my first priority and I ask the media for privacy at this time.’  To my wonderful husband…… #happyfathersday #weloveyou ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ A post shared by Georgina Chapman (@georginachapmanmarchesa) on Jun 18, 2017 at 7:49pm PDT        *          At the same time as Chapman made the announcement, Weinstein made a departure of his own – to Europe, by private jet.  There he will undergo therapy for sex addiction and behavioral issues, TMZ reported.  Weinstein also hopes that he will still be able to serve the Weinstein Company, from which he was fired by the board on Sunday, in some capacity.  His legal team are in talks with the company, and according to an insider, he ‘wants to come back with fresh, new ideas’.  Chapman, 41, met Weinstein, 65, in 2003 and they married four years later, going on to have two children, India Pearl, seven, and Dashiell Max Robert, four.  She is also the co-founder of high-end women’s fashion line Marchesa – and before the announcement of her split from Weinstein, sources said that she was struggling to save the brand from being tarnished by her husband’s allegations.

1875,Muf,,12,31,2099,9 Republicans Co-Sponsoring More Gun Control for Law-Abiding Americans,"Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-FL) introduced gun control aimed at law-abiding Americans on Tuesday. His bill has nine Republican co-sponsors, which means nine Republicans are willing to punish every law-abiding American for the behavior of one criminal in Las Vegas.  And they are doing all this to ban bump stocks, a product the ATF evaluated and approved in 2010.  The ATF approved the stocks because they are accessories for semiautomatics rather than conversion devices that turn semiautomatics into fully automatic weapons. Curbelo’s bill gets around the ATF’s approval by explicitly banning certain accessories for AR-15s, even if those accessories “[do] not convert the semiautomatic rifle into a machine gun.”  And like the Democrat bill–put forward by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA)–Curbelo’s bill is already broader than bump stocks alone. In other words, it is a ban that will keep on giving for the Democrats and other gun control proponents.  Here are the nine Republicans who are co-sponsoring Curbelo’s bill:  Rep. Peter King (R-NY) Rep. Leonard Lance (R-NJ) Rep. Patrick Meehan (R-PA) Rep, Ed Royce (R-CA) Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ) Rep. Erik Paulsen (R-MN) Rep. Ryan Costello (R-PA) Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL) Rep. Charlie Dent (R-PA)  The push to ban bump stocks is especially rich in light of the fact that using the devices probably made the Vegas attacker less effective than he would have been without them. After all, bump stocks are made for novelty rather than precision. For this reason, U.S. Army Sergeant First Class special forces soldier Tony Cowden suggests the Vegas attacker could have been deadlier if he had shot slower with a rifle not outfitted with a bump stock:  Bump stocks may have made Paddock less deadly https://t.co/90ddK51Y8w pic.twitter.com/eC42rf8k11 — Justin Miller (@justinjm1) October 4, 2017  Moreover, the effect one achieves with a bump stock can be achieved with an index finger and a belt-loop; no bump stock device needed. So what will Republican gun controllers do if they ban bump stocks and realize that people are still having fun with their rifles via blue jean belt loops? Will they ban belt loops?  In summary–Bump stocks are accessories, not conversion kits. They are novelties that reduce accuracy by producing a short, rapid-fire effect that can be achieved using nothing more than a finger and belt loop. For these reasons, Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) stresses that bump stock gun control is part of a larger misdirection that creates a “slippery slope” Democrats can exploit for more gun control in the future. Yet Reps. Peter King, Leonard Lance, Patrick Meehan, Ed Royce, Chris Smith, Erik Paulsen, Ryan Costello, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and Charlie Dent are rallying behind Curbelo’s gun control bill.

1884,Muf,,12,31,2099,Report: North Korean Hackers Targeted U.S. Power Grid,"According to a new report from security firm FireEye, “actors likely affiliated with the North Korean government” have attempted to hack American electric companies, in what appears to be “early-stage reconnaissance” for a possible future cyber attack.  FireEye’s analysis states that any such large-scale attack “might take months to prepare” if the reconnaissance had not been detected, so the threat was not necessarily “imminent.”  “We have not observed suspected North Korean actors using any tool or method specifically designed to compromise or manipulate the industrial control systems (ICS) networks that regulate the supply of power. Furthermore, we have not uncovered evidence that North Korean linked actors have access to any such capability at this time,” the report adds.  The hackers were evidently using “spear phishing” techniques, which essentially involve fabricating realistic-looking emails from trusted sources to trick users into opening malware-laced attachments or click links to virus-spreading websites.  Many of the largest data breaches in recent times are thought to have involved spear phishing, rather than the brute-force system penetration most people envision when they think of cyber attacks. Among other advantages, spear phishing can allow intruders to lurk inside compromised systems for extended periods undetected since they gained entry with legitimate passwords stolen from phishing victims.  FireEye recalls that North Korean hackers are believed to have planted malware in South Korean energy companies in 2014, but they did not damage or disable the power grid – they stole some sensitive documents and exposed them, “as part of an effort to exaggerate the access they had and embarrass the South Korean government.” A similar information-warfare strategy may have been in motion against American electric companies.  On the other hand, the report describes North Korea’s cyber espionage squads as “bold,” determined to “demonstrate national strength and resolve,” and largely devoid of “concern for potential discover and attribution of their operations.” North Korea is one of several nations that appears interested in developing the capability to disrupt power grids, either to attack the morale and economic strength of adversary nations during broader conflicts or to intimidate and deter potential opponents.  FireEye’s chief technology officer for the Asia-Pacific region, Bryce Boland, told CNN that North Korea “almost certainly has the capability to conduct disruptive and potentially destructive attacks, as well as more traditional cyber espionage operations.”  Boland added that North Korea’s isolation and generally backward economy give it advantages in cyberwar because it “has little connectivity and relatively limited reliance on technology.”  North Korean defector Kim Heung-kwang explained to CNN that Pyongyang aggressively cultivates and trains computer experts, managing a network of 250 elite computer schools and harvesting the most talented students for cyber warfare training at two special schools in Pyongyang. Kim added that some of the top graduates are sent to secretly work with China’s elite “Bureau 121” hacker squad.  Bloomberg Technology quotes South Korean defense estimates that North Korea now boasts an army of about 1,700 state-sponsored hackers, plus over 5,000 support staff.  NBC News cites its own previous reporting on North Korea’s interest in cyber attacks against U.S. infrastructure and quotes former FBI counterintelligence director C. Frank Figliuzzi calling FireEye’s report “a signal that North Korea is a player in the cyber-intrusion field and is growing in its ability to hurt us.”  Robert Lee, a cybersecurity consultant for the U.S. power industry, assured NBC that while infrastructure corporates are duly concerned about hacking threats, America’s adversaries are “far from being able to disrupt the electric grid.”  Although Lee said the electric grid is more secure than some of the more alarmed critics believe, Figliuzzi countered that some private utility companies are better equipped for cyberwar than others, and hostile powers like North Korea will “start looking for the weakest link.”",http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/10/11/report-north-korean-hackers-targeted-u-s-power-grid/

The California state legislature has opposed Trump’s agenda by becoming a so-called sanctuary state, as well as trying to force him to release his tax returns and even passing a resolution calling for him to apologize for “racist and bigoted behavior.”  Feinstein, however, took criticism from the left in August for expressing the hope that Trump would change to be more cooperative with Democrats.  “I just hope he has the ability to learn and to change, and if he does, he can be a good president,” she said, receiving boos from the San Francisco audience. She later said she is “under no illusion that it’s likely to happen and will continue to oppose his policies.”  De León will likely be one of multiple contenders for Feinstein’s seat. A source said Democratic mega-donor and environmentalist Tom Steyer is “very much looking at the Senate race,” and in a letter Wednesday he also called on Democrats to impeach Trump.  California has an open primary in which the top two vote-getters, regardless of party, face off in the general election. The primary will be held on June 5, 2018.

Fonda told Maher that one of the benefits of being a celebrity is that you can bring attention to things that need to be addressed, she then went on to refer to President Trump as the “Predator in Chief”. Of course, Hanoi Jane had no evidence whatsoever to back up such a hideous claim, yet, she made the claim anyhow.

That younger actress was Rosana Arquette, who shared her horrible experience with the “celebrity” Jane Fonda. Fonda, who bragged about having so much power to bring attention to important issues, did absolutely nothing about it.  Hypocrite Hanoi Jane would rather stay mum about an actual sexual predator who was harming so many young women in her industry, than risk being ostracized in Hollywood. It was better to just stick to the “hate Trump” script and get along with the other sickening hypocrites in Hollywood than to expose a serial sexual predator who should’ve been stopped years ago if there weren’t so many self-serving and shallow human beings running around Hollywood.          *          Watch:  Hanoi Jane’s very comfortable trashing President Trump who she believes can’t hurt her career, but when it comes to the mega-Democrat donor, and Hollywood kingpin producer, Harvey Weinstein, all bets are off..

When asked why she didn’t speak up back then, the 79-year-old actress said: ‘I was not that bold. I guess it hadn’t happened to me and I didn’t feel it was my place.’  She was informed of Weinstein’s transgressions by Rosanna Arquette – one of the many women who have since spoken out against the movie mogul.  ‘It came as a shock and a great disappointment,’ Fonda said.  ‘I only met Harvey when I was old and Harvey goes for young because that’s more vulnerable.’  She added that she was proud of the victims for speaking out but it wasn’t a unique or isolated case and specifically mentioned Bill Cosby’s history.  ‘This is not unique, this goes on at the most horrendous high levels,’ she said.  ‘I’m glad it’s coming out, I’m so proud of those fellow actors that are speaking up.

Even one of her most reliable media allies, David Gregory of NBC News, who was clearly on the same team as Nancy, questioned her sanity and most especially, her knowledge of what was in the Obamacare bill, following her curious remarks:  We’re pretty sure that most Americans are more confident in President Trump’s knowledge of the benefits to Americans, once they are able to purchase insurance across state lines than they were in Nancy’s ability to understand the 20,000 page Obamacare legislation.",https://100percentfedup.com/trump-begins-dismantling-obamacare-todays-executive-ordernancy-pelosis-response-hilarious/
1949,Muf,,12,31,2099,Trump won’t pull out of ‘worst’ Iran nuclear deal _ for now,"President Donald Trump on Friday angrily accused Iran of violating the landmark 2015 international nuclear accord, blaming the Iranians for a litany of sinister behavior and hitting their main military wing with anti-terror penalties. But Trump, breaking his campaign pledge to rip up the agreement, did not pull the U.S. out or re-impose nuclear sanctions.  He still might, he was quick to add. For now, he’s tossing the issue to Congress and the other world powers in the accord, telling lawmakers to toughen the law that governs U.S. participation and calling on the other parties to fix a series of deficiencies. Those include the scheduled expiration of key restrictions under “sunset provisions” that begin to kick in in 2025, as well as the omission of provisions on ballistic missile testing and terrorism.  Without the fixes, Trump warned, he would likely pull the U.S. out of the deal — which he has called the worst in U.S. history — and slap previously lifted U.S. sanctions back into place. That would probably be a fatal blow for the accord.  “Our participation can be canceled by me, as president, at any time,” Trump declared in a carefully delivered speech read from a teleprompter in the Diplomatic Reception Room at the White House. He added later, speaking of Congress, “They may come back with something that’s very satisfactory to me, and if they don’t, within a very short period of time, I’ll terminate the deal.”  Under U.S. law, Trump faces a Sunday deadline to certify to Congress whether Iran is complying with the accord. That notification must take place every 90 days, a timetable that Trump detests. Since taking office, he has twice reluctantly certified that Iran is fulfilling its commitments.  On Friday, he said he would not do so again.  Trump alone cannot actually terminate the accord, which lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for concessions regarding its nuclear program. But withdrawing the U.S. would render the deal virtually meaningless.  That would be risky, though, and could badly damage U.S. credibility in future international negotiations. The accord was struck after 18 months of negotiations between the Obama administration, Iran, Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the European Union and then endorsed by a unanimous vote in the U.N. Security Council.  Trump’s main national security aides have all argued for staying in the deal. So have key allies in Europe who are leery of altering an accord that they believe has prevented Iran from assembling an arsenal of atomic weapons.  Overseas reaction to Friday’s speech was swift.  Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said that his country would continue to stick to the nuclear deal and that the U.S. was isolating itself, “more lonely than ever,” by condemning the accord.  Indeed, the leaders of Britain, Germany and France urged Trump in a joint statement not to do anything rash.  “We encourage the U.S. administration and Congress to consider the implications to the security of the U.S. and its allies before taking any steps that might undermine the (deal), such as re-imposing sanctions on Iran lifted under the agreement,” they said. Still, they added, “Independent of the (deal) we need to make sure that our collective wider concerns are being addressed.”  In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Trump and said the U.S. president had created an opportunity to “fix this bad deal” and roll back Iran’s aggression. Netanyahu has long warned that the accord failed to address Iran’s support for militant groups who act against Israel.  Trump opened his speech by reciting a long list of grievances with Iran dating back to the 1979 Islamic Revolution and the seizure of the U.S. Embassy and American hostages in Tehran. He then noted terrorist attacks against Americans and American allies committed by Iranian proxies, such as Hezbollah, and Iran’s ongoing ballistic missile tests.  “We cannot and will not make this certification” that Iran is complying with the accord, he said. “We will not continue down a path whose predictable conclusion is more violence, more terror and the very real threat of Iran’s nuclear breakout.”  But “decertifying” the deal stops well short of pulling out and simply moves the issues over to Congress. Lawmakers now have 60 days to decide whether to put the accord’s previous sanctions back into place, modify them or do nothing.  Republicans face a heavy lift in rallying GOP lawmakers and Democrats behind legislation that would make the accord more stringent and please Trump. Some GOP senators, like Marco Rubio of Florida, question whether the pact can be fixed.  Further complicating matters, a GOP lawmaker who will be at the center of what’s sure to be a stormy debate is Bob Corker of Tennessee, who recently compared Trump’s White House to “an adult day care center” and said the president could be setting the U.S. on a path toward World War III.  Ahead of Trump’s speech, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the administration wants lawmakers to come up with legislation that would automatically re-impose sanctions that were lifted under the deal should Iran cross any one of numerous nuclear and non-nuclear “trigger points.”  Those would include illicit atomic work or ballistic missile testing; support for Syrian President Bashar Assad, Lebanon’s Hezbollah movement and other groups that destabilize the region, or human rights abuses and cyber warfare, Tillerson said.  Also Friday, Trump said he was hitting Iran’s Revolutionary Guard with sanctions for supporting terrorism. But the U.S. is not adding the Guard to the formal U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations. That step would force the U.S. to take even further steps against the Guard that Tillerson says could be problematic.  ___  AP writers Deb Riechmann and Richard Lardner contributed to this report.","https://www.apnews.com//a660d3fd7e93484f82095122de8d4ff8/Trump-speech-to-vilify-Iran-over-nuke-deal,-non-nuke-issues"

1985,Muf,,12,31,2099,Global finance leaders warn against complacency,"White House senior adviser Ivanka Trump accompanied by World Bank President Jim Yong Kim speaks at the forum Taking Women-Owned Business to the Next Level, on the sidelines of the World Bank/IMF annual meetings in Washington, Saturday, Oct. 14, 2017. ( AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Global finance leaders on Saturday appealed to central bankers to stick as long as possible with low-interest rate policies that have made borrowing attractive and helped safeguard an improving but still fragile world economic recovery.  Declaring the “recovery is not complete” even eight years after the 2008 financial crisis, the 189-nation International Monetary Fund wrapped up its fall meetings with a communique warning “there is no room for complacency” as nations confront new challenges to global growth from a range of threats, including cyber-security attacks and more violent weather patterns linked to climate change.  The meetings also dealt, at least on the sidelines, with efforts to better understand the policy implications of the Trump administration’s more forceful “America First” agenda.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he had productive discussions during nearly 20 one-on-one meetings with other countries plus the joint sessions of the IMF and World Bank policy committees, as well as two days of talks centered on the Group of 20 major industrial countries.  Donald Trump won the presidency with pledges to toughen enforcement of U.S. trade laws and trim huge U.S. trade deficits with nations such as China and Mexico, which Trump has accused of unfair trade practices that have cost millions of American manufacturing jobs.  Mnuchin said he agreed with an assessment of German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble that the discussions this week were more relaxed than the initial talks held earlier this year, when the Trump team had first taken office, because there was a better understanding of Trump’s goals.  “We believe in free and fair and reciprocal trade,” Mnuchin told reporters Saturday, saying the Trump administration is simply trying to make sure U.S. workers and companies are treated fairly in trade deals with other nations.  Mnuchin said he carried in his pocket a list of all the G-20 nations and the size of the trade balances the United States has with each of those nations. With most of the G-20 countries, the United States is running a trade deficit.  Schauble, the chairman of the G-20 finance group this year, said he believed the backlash against globalization was giving way to a greater understanding that the path toward rising prosperity for all depends on greater cooperation among countries.  But the Trump administration so far has been highly skeptical of various multilateral organizations. This week, the United States pulled out of UNESCO, the United Nations’ cultural agency. It has scrapped an Asia-Pacific trade deal and is threatening to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. And it is has balked at providing additional capital to the World Bank unless the anti-poverty agency rethinks the way it distributes loans.  In his speech Saturday to the IMF policy group, Mnuchin said he wanted to see the IMF be a more “forceful advocate” for strong global growth by imposing more stringent surveillance on the economic policies being pursued by its member countries and by taking a hard look at changes that needed to be made by countries running large trade surpluses.  While the IMF communique called on major central banks to protect the global recovery by being cautious in withdrawing the support it has had in place since the 2008 financial crisis, in many cases the trend seems to be moving in the opposite direction.  In the United States, the Federal Reserve has raised short-term interest rates twice this year and is beginning to reduce its large portfolio of bonds, a move that could push long-term rates higher. In Europe, the euro currency has risen since spring on expectations that the European Central Bank will withdraw its long-standing stimulus program. The ECB meets Oct. 26.  “Monetary policy should remain accommodative, where inflation is still below target and output gaps” still exist, the communique said.  On Saturday, Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and a White House adviser, appeared with World Bank President Jim Yong Kim to launch a World Bank initiative to support women entrepreneurs. The World Bank fund has raised $350 million, which is designed to allow the World Bank to deploy at least $1 billion in capital to finance women-owned businesses.  Ivanka Trump told the audience she wanted to “spend a lot of time offering any value that I can as a mentor.”","https://www.apnews.com//83f1dd641a844512a96e831d4091a5c5/IMF,-World-Bank-push-back-against-globalization's-detractors"

Justin Rosenstein, an early Facebook engineer, now considers his invention as a contributor to “time poorly spent,” as he wrote in Thrive Global earlier this year.  “Designing software to create time well spent vs. merely time spent is challenging, even with the best of intentions,” Rosenstein wrote.  Rosenstein created the Facebook Like button as a result of a “hackathon” project in 2008 while still at the company.  SHERYL SANDBERG: CONGRESS SHOULD RELEASE FACEBOOK ADS TO THE PUBLIC  While he noted that the Like button succeeds at some things like drawing attention to a friend’s interests or acting as a catalyst for “positive sentiment,” it also results in gobs of “time wasted” when looking at videos that “don’t nourish your life” or are just constant distractions that are unproductive and disruptive.  This topic was recently highlighted in The Guardian, which said that smartphone use (and technology in general) is not just addictive, but it contributes to “continuous partial attention,” wreaking havoc on people’s ability to focus and potentially making them dumber.  “One recent study showed that the mere presence of smartphones damages cognitive capacity – even when the device is turned off,” the article noted.  Many of these early technologists are now “weaning themselves off their own products” and teaching their children to put down iPhones, iPads, and laptops, the Guardian added. However, the problem is large technology companies often define success as “time spent on site,” Rosenstein wrote.  Rosenstein is now co-founder of a workplace software startup, known as Asana, and is currently working on an app that seeks to address some these issues.  ZUCKERBERG BLASTED FOR VR TOUR OF HURRICANE-RAVAGED PUERTO RICO  Use versus abuse  ""You need to define addiction.

""If you throw around this word 'addiction,' it really hurts people. It disempowers people to take control of it. 'It's not my fault, it's the technology's fault.'"" Eyal said, adding if you shirk personal responsibility, you're more likely to relapse.  But companies do have a ""moral imperative"" to at least try to help real addicts. ""We have personally identifiable information who is using and who is abusing,"" he said.  For example, a company could have a policy where ""if you use our product more than X number of hours per week, we're going to reach out to and ask if we can help you,"" he said. And if they are receptive and accept the offer for help, then the company can step in, he said.  ""Whining about this to a company is not going to stop anything.

2003,Muf,,12,31,2099,"Trump too tough on Iran, North Korea, Clinton says","With his tough talk and hardline stances on Iran and North Korea, President Donald Trump is damaging America’s credibility abroad – and could provoke a nuclear-arms race in East Asia, Hillary Clinton says.  Trump's recent threat to decertify the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, “makes us look foolish and small and plays right into Iranian hands,” Clinton said last week.  ""That is bad not just on the merits for this particular situation, but it sends a message across the globe that America's word is not good,"" said Clinton, who spoke in advance of Trump's announcement Friday that he wants Congress and the other nations that negotiated the deal to toughen the requirements for Iran.  ""This particular president is, I think, upending the kind of trust and credibility of the United States' position and negotiation that is imperative to maintain.""  ""This particular president is, I think, upending the kind of trust and credibility of the United States' position and negotiation that is imperative to maintain."" — Hillary Clinton  For his part, Trump says that Clinton, as secretary of state under former President Barack Obama, helped negotiate a “terrible” deal with Iran.  Getting tough on Iran is the right approach, the president said.  “We will not continue down a path whose predictable conclusion is more violence, more terror and the very real threat of Iran’s nuclear breakout,” Trump said Friday, according to the Washington Times. “Iran is not living up to the spirit of the deal.”  Clinton also denounced Trump's bellicose language toward North Korea, saying his verbal aggression has rattled U.S. allies.  ""We will now have an arms race — a nuclear arms race in East Asia,"" Clinton predicted. ""We will have the Japanese, who understandably are worried with missiles flying over them as the North Koreans have done, that they can't count on America.""  Clinton stressed that a diplomatic solution was preferred, and suggested the inflammatory rhetoric played into Kim Jung Un's hands. She bemoaned Trump's public undercutting of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson when he tweeted ""Save your energy, Rex"" after the nation's top diplomat had suggested negotiations.  “Diplomacy, preventing war, creating some deterrents is slow, hard-going, difficult work,” said Clinton, who declined to answer when asked whether Tillerson should resign. ""And you can't have impulsive people or ideological people who basically say, 'Well, we're done with you.'""  Trump on Sept. 21 signed an executive order calling for a new round of economic sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.  The president said the actions were aimed at “a complete denuclearization of North Korea,” the Washington Times reported.  “North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile development is a grave threat to peace and security in our world,” Trump said. “It is unacceptable that others financially support this criminal rogue regime.”  Clinton, who recently released a book that recounts her election defeat to Trump, has been an aggressive critic of the president.  In an interview with Britain’s BBC on Friday, Clinton called Trump a “sexual assaulter.”  Clinton made the comments when asked about the allegations of sexual assault made against Democratic mega-donor and Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.  “This kind of behavior cannot be tolerated anywhere, whether it's in entertainment, politics,” Clinton said. “After all, we have someone admitting to being a sexual assaulter in the Oval Office.”  In the same interview, Clinton referred to the sexual transgressions of her husband – former President Bill Clinton – as being “clearly in the past,”  reported.

2008,Muf,,12,31,2099,It’s easy to become obese in America. These 7 charts explain why.,"It’s no secret that Americans have gotten much, much bigger over the past few decades. The signs are all around us, from XXXL clothing sizes to supersize movie seats and even larger coffins.  According to an analysis from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the average American man now stands at 5-feet-9 1/4 inches tall and weighs 196 pounds — up 15 pounds from 20 years ago. For women, the change has been even more striking: The average female today stands 5-feet-3 3/4 inches and weighs 169 pounds. In 1994, her scale read 152 pounds  The latest CDC estimates now show that, as of 2016, 40 percent of US adults and 19 percent of youth were obese.  This data on the state of our weight comes from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES), a combination of interviews and physical examinations that's considered the gold standard measurement. Since the 1980s, the NHANES has been charting obesity rates — and extreme obesity rates — as they've soared.  Alongside the rise in obesity, we’ve also seen growing rates of associated chronic disease — like diabetes, heart disease, and metabolic syndrome.  Clearly it’s gotten easier and easier to gain weight, and harder and harder to avoid it.  Atkins. Paleo. Keto. Do any of these diets work in the long term? We looked at the influence of marketing, food environments, and genes to explain why so many diets fail for Explained, our weekly show on Netflix. Watch now on Netflix.  So what’s going on here? There’s an obvious answer — we eat more than we burn off. But increasingly public health experts agree that we are not consciously choosing to overeat.  ""The food environment is a strong predictor of how we eat,"" says Scott Kahan, director of the National Center for Weight and Wellness and a faculty member at both Johns Hopkins and George Washington University. ""And in America, the unhealthiest foods are the tastiest foods, the cheapest foods, the largest-portion foods, the most available foods, the most fun foods.""  But why talk about how our food environment enables overeating with words when we can show it with charts? Let’s do it.  1) We eat out — a lot  Americans are cooking less and less and eating away from home more and more. And that’s leading us to chow down more than we would if we were home.  More than half of our food dollars are now being spent on restaurants and convenient on-the-go meals. In 2015, for the first time, Americans spent more money eating away from home than they did on groceries.  Sure, it’s possible to have a small, healthy meal at a restaurant. But researchers have found that people typically eat 20 to 40 percent more calories in restaurants compared with what they’d eat at home.  To understand why that happens, consider data from this recent study in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. The authors examined the nutrition content of more than 360 dinner entrees at 123 non-chain restaurants in San Francisco, Boston, and Little Rock between 2011 and 2014. The restaurant dishes contained 1,200 calories, on average — about half of the 2,000 or 2,500 calories recommended for moderately active women and men in an entire day.  2) Portion sizes have gone up, up, up  When we eat out, we’re not being served modest plates. The average restaurant meal today is more than four times the size of typical 1950s fare, according to the CDC.  These supersize portions are reflected in our daily calorie intake. The average American’s total caloric intake grew from 2,109 calories in 1970 to 2,568 calories in 2010. As Pew Research put it, that’s ""the equivalent of an extra steak sandwich every day.""  3) We guzzle sugary beverages on an unrivaled scale  People who drink soda have more obesity, Type 2 diabetes, tooth decay, and other health problems compared with people who don't -- the research on this is clear. And Americans are drinking way, way too much of the sweet stuff. According to Euromonitor’s most recent data, Americans remain the world leaders when it comes to per capita sales of soft drinks.  That said, one of the biggest public health wins of recent decades has been a slow shift away from soda in the United States.  With more awareness about the strong correlation between drinking sweet, fizzy drinks and obesity and tooth decay, sales of beverages like Coca-Cola and Pepsi have slumped.  But we may still be getting hoodwinked by other, equally sugary beverages. According to Euromonitor’s analysis of US retail beverage sales over the past five years, while the soda category is shrinking, juice sales have held steady, and sales of energy and sports drinks have been growing.  4) Healthier foods can cost more  The federal government recommends 1 1/2 to 2 cups of fruit and 2 to 3 cups of vegetables per day. According to the CDC, Americans in every state barely hit these minimum targets.  Fewer than 10 percent of American adults ate enough vegetables in 2013. Fewer than 15 percent consumed the recommended amount of fruit.  The Americans who aren’t eating broccoli don’t have a vendetta against it. Instead, there is a range of economic and social factors that make eating enough fruits and vegetables really hard.  Let’s start with cost: As you can see in the chart, when it comes to how many calories you get per dollar, sugar, vegetable oils, and refined grains deliver a higher bang for the buck than fruits and vegetables. In the long run, nutrients in food (like fiber, vitamins, and minerals) matter more for health than calories alone. But if your household income is low, you’re probably going for the cheapest, highest-calorie options.  5) Our vegetables consist mainly of potatoes and tomatoes  To make things more complicated, there’s a supply problem. We’re told to eat nutrient-dense foods like broccoli and Brussels sprouts instead of energy-dense foods like soda and french fries, yet there aren’t enough nutrient-dense foods to go around. Researchers have pointed out that if Americans actually followed the US dietary guidelines and started to eat the volume and variety of produce health officials recommend, we wouldn’t have nearly enough to meet consumer demand.  As of 2013, potatoes and tomatoes made up half of the legumes and vegetables available in this country, according to the US Department of Agriculture. And when we do eat tomatoes and potatoes, they’re often accompanied by so much sugar, fat, and salt that we’re propelled to overeat.  6) Too many of our meals are like dessert  American breakfast is often nothing more than disguised dessert. And we keep eating sugar throughout the day — in cupcakes, soda, even salad dressing.  So many of the additional calories in our diet that weren’t there a few decades ago are coming in the form of sugar. Back in 1977, the average adult got 228 calories per day from sugar in food and drinks. By 2010, it was up to 300 calories a day. Added sugar consumption increased almost as much — 20 percent — among kids.  Between 2003 and 2012, sugar consumption in adults and kids has come down a bit. But it’s still way too high.  ""Added sugars increase excess energy and reduce nutrient density in our diets, often contributing to weight gain and obesity,"" said Elyse Powell, one of the researchers at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill who crunched these numbers.  7) We’re bombarded with ads for unhealthy food  Sugary, oily foods are engineered to be consumed often and in big portions. But we’re not just influenced by their irresistible taste. The food industry is also terrific at marketing its products to us — and turning us into loyal consumers.  A 2006 report by the Institute of Medicine helped establish how the rise in obesity among kids corresponds to increasing marketing of unhealthy food and drinks to them. Since then, public health researchers have tracked food advertising — and have discovered how in some ways, this problem just keeps getting worse.  The UConn Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity found that in 2014, food companies spent $1.28 billion to advertise snack foods on television, in magazines, in coupons, and, increasingly, on the internet and mobile devices. Almost 60 percent of that advertising spending promoted sweet and savory snacks, while just 11 percent promoted fruit and nut snacks. And advertising of sweet snacks increased 15 percent, even from 2010 to 2014, according to Rudd’s analysis.  According to Jennifer Harris, director of marketing initiatives for the Rudd Center and lead author of the Rudd report, the public health community has pressured food companies to change how they advertise their products to kids. And there’s been some progress — 10 years ago, she says, companies argued that all of their products were healthy and there was no reason kids shouldn’t be eating them. ""Now there’s recognition that the marketing does affect kids’ diets in harmful ways. Now the discussion is around what’s healthy and what’s unhealthy. Now we’re in the details.""  But instead of promoting healthier foods, Harris says that companies have mostly reformulated their existing products to make them only slightly less unhealthy.  ""The sugar in kids' cereals has gone from an average of 12 to 13 grams to 9 to 10 grams,"" says Harris. ""But the cereal industry has products that do qualify as healthy, and yet they don’t advertise them to kids. The healthy cereals are advertised to parents, not kids.""  How the food environment could support healthful eating instead  With the expansion of our waistlines over the past 30 years, the factors in our environment that promote obesity — some of them outlined here — have come into focus. To reverse the trend, health officials have begun experimenting with a number of different policies.  First and foremost is taxation. Taxes helped wean people off cigarettes, and public health researchers think they may reduce consumption of fatty, sugary junk food. US cities (Berkeley and Seattle) and several countries (including the UK, France, Hungary, Chile, and Mexico) are experimenting with taxes on junk foods like soda. So far, the (very preliminary) research suggests the taxes may be helping to get low-income families off the sugary stuff — a win since those are the families most at risk of diet-related diseases.  Another tactic researchers argue should be widely tested is putting a warning labels and symbols on junk foods. There’s ample evidence that many people can’t make sense of the traditional food labels on the back of food packages: they too often require math, and some knowledge of nutrition. What’s more, they don’t always contain information about “nutrients of concern,” like added sugar. So countries like Chile have been experimenting with easier-to-understand warning labels on foods.  A variety of healthier foods — especially fruits and vegetables — also need to be made more affordable and readily available to Americans. To this end, nonprofits like Wholesome Wave have been working with government to offer fruit and vegetable subsidies for the poor, and even experiment with produce prescriptions (which are essentially vouchers handed out by doctors to patients with problems with food access).  Big food companies need to clean up their offerings, working with health experts to create alternatives that aren’t chockablock with fat, salt, and sugar. Kahan noted that many obesity researchers like him are working more closely with the industry. ""A lot of big players have made real specific declarations of making healthier products, smaller portions,"" he said.  The status of fruits and vegetables also needs to be lifted up, so that we see these options in our foodscape instead of only billboards for greasy hamburgers and candy. Here, too, there’s movement. A number of celebrities and even Olympic athletes have been working with nonprofit organizations and grocery stores to appear in colorful advertisements peddling everything from apples to tomatoes.  So progress is happening slowly, but it’ll take time to understand what, if any, impact this has on our health. As Kahan said, ""Transforming the food industry is one of the real uphill battles that will have to be fought over the next few decades.""",https://www.vox.com/2016/8/31/12368246/charts-explain-obesity

GEORGE LOPEZ Booed Off Stage At Children’s Diabetes Charity After Audience Rejects His Anti-Trump Jokes ,"George Lopez was hired to be the emcee for the Children’s Diabetes Foundation’s Carousel Ball. Lopez thought it would be a good idea to turn what should have been an event to help sick children into an opportunity to express his hate for President Trump and his supporters. Bad idea…  Here’s the promotion for Lopez from the Children’s Diabetes Foundation on Twitter:  We are excited to announce that commedian & acotor @georgelopez will be the emcee for this year's #CarouselBall! https://t.co/cO9eHKviPO pic.twitter.com/aCpAI9F22a — CDF (@CDFdiabetes) September 21, 2017        *            Comic George Lopez was booed off stage at a gala for juvenile diabetes in Denver last week, over an anti-Donald Trump routine that fell flat with the crowd.  We’re told the flap began when Trump backer and Liberty Media CEO Greg Maffei donated $250,000 but requested that Lopez cool it with the anti-Trump jokes at the Carousel Ball.  An attendee at the event — where tables sold from $5,000 to $100,000 to benefit the Barbara Davis Center for Diabetes — commented on a YouTube video that “George was asked nicely to stop making Trump jokes by a man in front row [Maffei] who just donated $250K.” But “George doesn’t, continues. Gets booed.”  We’re told that Lopez responded to Maffei, “Thank you for changing my opinion on old white men, but it doesn’t change the way I feel about orange men.”  Trying to recover and sensing the audience turn, Lopez said, “Listen, it’s about the kids . . . I apologize for bringing politics to an event. This is America — it still is.

Albright College in Reading cut Gyree Durante from its team after he took a knee during the Star-Spangled Banner, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.        *    Email *  Name      According to the paper, the school promised consequences if players took actions different than those made in a special agreement.  The team’s “leadership council” decided that the squad would take a knee during the pregame coin toss, but stand for the national anthem.  “I knew the consequences. I knew that if I took a knee, that there would be a good chance that I would be kicked off.” “I didn’t like the whole taking a knee during the coin toss, I just thought it defeated the whole purpose of kneeing for the anthem. I get the whole team unity thing, but at the end of the day, I also thought that we should be allowed to be individuals, and express ourselves.” “The week before, I was watching NFL football, and I happened to see some of the remarks by President Trump about, uh, regarding NFL players taking a knee during the anthem, and he said that they should be fired, they should be kicked off and things like that. I already knew that it was an issue with, all of the racial and social injustice and you know, police brutality among African Americans and things like that. But when I heard the President say something about it, and, it was very negative, it just kinda struck a nerve with me and it made me think, if this is how the President feels, then Idefinitelyy need to take a need and protest this.” (Go here for video)  After Durante knelt, the Division III Lions went on to lose to Delaware Valley University, from nearby Doylestown, by 41-6.  Durante’s name was wiped from the team roster and a college spokesperson said in a statement obtained by ESPN that the Norristown, Pa. native was dismissed for his actions. – FOX News",https://100percentfedup.com/college-qb-kneed-anger-trumps-remarks-nfl-players-disrespecting-flagimmediately-gets-bad-news-coach/
2026,Muf,,12,31,2099,Northern Michigan University offers marijuana degree,"A university in Michigan is offering an unusual degree — in marijuana.  Northern Michigan University in Marquette began its medical plant chemistry program this semester, with about a dozen students in the first class, the Detroit Free Press reported . The program combines chemistry, biology, botany, horticulture, marketing and finance.  It’s an unusual program. Other universities offer classes on marijuana policy and law. And places such as Oaksterdam University, Cannabis College, and Humboldt Cannabis College, all in California; and THC University, the Grow School and Clover Leaf University in Denver offer certificates in a variety of disciplines. But Northern Michigan’s program is unique because the university is offering a four-year degree addressing the science and business behind growing marijuana.  “When they hear what my major is, there are a lot of people who say, ‘Wow, cool dude. You’re going to get a degree growing marijuana,’” said Alex Roth, a sophomore in the program. “But it’s not an easy degree at all.”  Brandon Canfield, an associate chemistry professor at Northern Michigan, said students don’t grow marijuana plants in the program, but instead look to other plants that are traditionally recognized with medicinal value but aren’t illegal to grow. Students learn how to measure and extract the compounds in the plants that can be used for medicinal purposes, then transfer that knowledge to marijuana, which has been used to treat a variety of illnesses, including chronic pain, nausea, seizures and glaucoma.  Canfield said he got the idea while attending the American Chemical Society’s annual meeting in San Diego last year.  “It was my off day and I saw there was a cannabis chemistry group that was putting on a whole series of talks,” he said. “I heard all about the need for analytical chemists and all sorts of interesting talks. That was the initial spark.”  University officials say the program fills a need because 29 states have legalized medical marijuana, including eight states where marijuana is also legal for recreational use.  “Many of the states are legalizing different substances and they’re really looking for quality people to do the chemistry and the science,” said university trustee James Haveman. “And it’s the university’s responsibility to produce those kinds of students for those kinds of jobs.”  In Michigan, voters in 2008 approved the use of marijuana to treat certain illnesses, but the law has confused many and has led to significant legal disputes, including over how to obtain and store the drug. The state is developing a new regulatory system aimed at increasing oversight and imposing new taxes on the industry. Applications for licenses will be available on Dec. 15.  ___  Information from: Detroit Free Press, http://www.freep.com",https://www.apnews.com//4f1d62c085e34b578317844386f4b58d/Northern-Michigan-University-offers-marijuana-degree

Jessica Tunis told the AP that she put her mother’s name and picture up on Facebook as a plea for help, after she heard her say “I’m going to die” over the phone as her home caught fire in the Journey’s End Mobile Home Park. Tunis said that she was initially concerned about making a post. “At first, I don’t know what I was thinking, but I wanted to respect my mother’s privacy… I didn’t want to spread her all over the place,” she said.  Tunis’ post gained over 100 comments, from friends and strangers, giving prayers and support, suggestions of places to look, with some even going out to look for her mother themselves. “I’ve had people going to shelters for me because of Facebook,” Tunis said.  Her post was one of many seen on Facebook after the fires, with family unable to trace down their loved ones, hoping they were only in an area with downed communication lines, and not one of those who did not survive. Approximately 200 people were reported missing to the authorities in Northern California.  Messages on Facebook searching for missing people are relatively common after natural disasters. Similar posts were seen after the recent hurricanes Harvey, Rita and Maria, and after the shooting in Las Vegas last week. Facebook also has its own feature, Safety Check, for those in affected areas to tell everyone that they are safe. Safety Check was first introduced after the tsunami in Japan of 2014, and was primarily used for natural disasters. But after the Paris terror attacks of 2015, Mark Zuckerberg deemed it would also be used in “many other important conflicts.”",http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2017/10/11/facebook-used-after-disasters-to-search-for-family-members/
2064,Muf,,12,31,2099,Insider Q&A: US Bank’s Terry Sandven on stocks’ flip-flop,"This photo provided by U.S. Bank Wealth Management shows Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist for U.S. Bank Wealth Management. Sandven explains to The  how investors’ views of the market have evolved and doubled back in the 11 months since the 2016 election. (Courtesy of U.S. Bank Wealth Management via AP)  NEW YORK (AP) — On the surface, the stock market may not have looked any different in September than it did earlier in the year. But even though indexes continued to climb, the market went through a shift.  Starting in late August, banks and industrial companies rose and the dollar got stronger. The Russell 2000 index has climbed 11 percent from mid-August as smaller, U.S.-focused companies made big gains. That’s a change from the way stocks have behaved for much of this year: technology companies and other corporations that do a lot of their business overseas had been soaring as the dollar weakened, and low interest rates have hampered financial company stocks. But if the September pattern sounds familiar, it should: it’s the same trend that dominated the market from the November presidential election through President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January.  Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist for U.S. Bank Wealth Management, explains how investors’ views of the market have evolved and doubled back in the 11th months since the election. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.  Q: Why has the market changed direction in the last few weeks?  A: Tax reform seems to be gaining steam, and that’s boosted sentiment as well as expectations for President Trump’s pro-growth agenda. With tax reform you’re likely to see earnings favorably impacted, and a pro-growth agenda tends to be favorable for small caps as well. So the Russell 2000 has been on a tear. Tax reform tends to be U.S.-centric and is likely to boost earnings, which obviously is favorable for the broad market. Secondly, should a tax reform come to pass and result in an elevated dollar, that could conversely put some pressure on earnings for multinational companies.  Q: So in a lot of ways, stocks are making the same moves they made about a year ago. How is this move different from that one?  A: Following the November election (investors anticipated) a pro-growth agenda, expectations for inflation, deregulation and tax cuts. The pro-growth agenda now is gaining some steam again. The key difference between now and then is we have greater visibility on earnings. Earnings for the S&P 500 are tracking for about a 10 percent increase year over year and in 2018 we’re seeing that same kind of growth. The whole global economy is improving, which means higher earnings and higher earnings mean higher stock prices. We still don’t see a looming recession or ramping inflation. Stocks still provide an opportunity for investors to get yield as well.  Clearly the equity market valuations are elevated, but we think there is valuation support in an environment where inflation is low. But while our outlook remains constructive, clearly risks remain. You do have a flattening yield curve, there’s political wrangling and low expectations on balance and you’ve got geopolitical tensions.  Q: Are there other reasons for those gains, like improvement in the economy?  A: There’s still much to like about the U.S. equity market. Earnings are increasing and generally restrained inflation and low interest rates provide support. The large caps are somewhat in pause mode ahead of third-quarter (earnings) reports. We’re seeing consensus expectations for about a 5-percent increase in earnings year over year and higher earnings still warrant higher stock prices. We like the macroeconomic and fundamentals backdrops.  Q: Have you advised investors to make any changes in response to this market shift?  A: Our message has been the same, really. That is that we like equities over fixed-income securities and we like U.S. stocks over international even though international growth is improving. Nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are in positive territory year to date, (which) implies a market that’s likely to trend higher. Technology and select areas of consumer discretionary and health care remain favorites.  Our year-end price target for the S&P 500 is 2,550, at the midpoint of a range between 2,500 and 2,600. Should tax reform visibility improve and earnings get reported as we expect they will, our sense is that we’ll end the year toward the high side of that range. (Note: The S&P 500 closed at 2,553 on Friday.)",https://www.apnews.com//a078354b8c47402d84a5faa09a055154/Insider-Q&A:-US-Bank's-Terry-Sandven-on-stocks'-flip-flop
2070,Muf,,12,31,2099,"Tax reform needs to keep R&D investment here in the US, not overseas","As President Donald Trump redoubles his efforts to fulfill campaign promises on tax reform, a critical part of his program is in jeopardy of being discarded, as a result of the efforts of uninformed or self-interested business lobbies.  The measure under attack is a proposal to increase taxes on importers of foreign goods and reduce taxes on exporters of American goods. It must be restored if tax reform is to achieve its objectives of stimulating investment, preventing American companies from continuing to off-shore R&D and manufacturing, and avoiding increases in the deficit.  The fundamental problem to be fixed by overall tax reform is that American companies pay the highest taxes in the developed world. As a result, U.S.-based multinationals have been moving their headquarters, research and development, and manufacturing activities overseas to lower-tax locales, forcing us to import goods that we used to produce at home.  Companies that do stay home get to keep such a small share of returns on their capital that they cannot afford to make investments that would be good for everyone.  This has other cascading effects. Research and development (R&D) is one of the most important categories of investment, in that it drives growth in productivity and wages as well as profits and output. Without R&D and the innovations it produces, our standard of living would hardly be better than it was at the end of the nineteenth century.  According to the National Science Foundation, business R&D spending is now three times as large as government R&D, but since 2010 the basic research share of R&D has declined. Basic research is the place where innovations start, and needs the most encouragement.  Lowering tax rates would improve the profitability of all long-term investments, and the payoffs from R&D are among the most long-term of all.  As happens too often in Washington, the one liner – border adjustments raise prices – seems to be winning, because it takes three sentences to prove it is wrong. And few politicians have a high enough opinion of the electorate to take that chance.  Another tax reform proposal, to eliminate the deductibility of interest paid by corporations, would level the playing field for high-tech companies with large R&D budgets, because these high-risk investments cannot be financed with loans. Failures are as common as success in the early stages of innovation, and require investors to spread those risks across a portfolio of projects rather than lenders who require collateral and assurance of repayment.  The subsidy that the current tax code provides to banks and lenders by making interest but not dividends deductible therefore directs investment away from just the kind of innovative companies whose discoveries drive growth.  Finally, the R&D tax credit is one of the two current business tax credits retained in the reform proposals.  Unfortunately, these provisions are not sufficient to make the U.S. competitive with the inducements offered by other countries to attract R&D activities to their shores. That difference was to be taken care of by border adjustment provisions in the original tax reform plan, which was presented to Congress by House Speaker Paul Ryan and Chairman Kevin Brady of the House Ways and Means Committee.  What the measure sought to redress is the fact that other countries try to attract R&D centers by offering extremely low tax rates on income generated by R&D activities, including income from patents and licensing of new products as well as income from manufacturing them.  The kicker is that the R&D and manufacturing must be done in the country offering the tax breaks.  When U.S. companies relocate overseas in response to these inducements, they avoid almost all taxes by hiring workers and keeping profits overseas while exporting manufactured goods back to the United States.  Not only that, companies that remain home must pay these off-shoring companies to use the patents that they registered overseas. Even if some of the new products are manufactured in the U.S., a large part of the profits are thereby siphoned off to other countries.  The border adjustment was intended to fix this by eliminating the opportunity to deduct payments for imports, including payments for foreign patents, from business income.  At the same time, it would level the playing field with companies doing business in these low-tax nations by making income from exports tax-free.  The whole package of lower taxes, a level playing field in capital markets, continued R&D tax credits and the border adjustment would provide powerful incentives to invest in R&D within the United States and to produce here the new and better goods that are the fruits of R&D.  Unfortunately, the lobbying campaign against the border adjustment was underway long before anyone had a chance to explain how it would work.  Executives from Walmart, Target, and other big retail chains and off-shoring manufacturers like Nike descended en masse on Republican senators of the states in which they had headquarters to extract promises to oppose the border adjustments.  Their pitch was that the border adjustment would drive their prices up by 25 percent, because almost everything they sold was imported.  The damage had been done by the time Chairman Brady and a number of economists correctly pointed out that the brunt of the import adjustment would be borne primarily by foreign companies which would have to adjust their prices downward in order to maintain market share for the foreign-made products they sell into the United States.  Any residual upward pressure on prices in the U.S. would for the same reason be absorbed by retailers and other importers or quickly be neutralized by an increase in the value of the dollar in import transactions.  In other words, no real increase in consumer prices would be likely to occur.  As happens too often in Washington, the one liner – border adjustments raise prices – seems to be winning, because it takes three sentences to prove it is wrong. And few politicians have a high enough opinion of the electorate to take that chance.  We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reform the tax code in a way that will stimulate innovation and productivity growth for decades to come.  It is imperative that we not only move forward with tax reform, but ensure that it retains all the key provisions necessary to keep R&D happening here.  That includes the border adjustment.",http://www.foxnews.com//opinion/2017/10/16/tax-reform-needs-to-keep-r-d-investment-here-in-us-not-overseas.html

The ruling, by United States Circuit Judge William C. Bryson of the Eastern District of Texas, does not mean that generic versions of the drug will be available soon, however. Allergan said that it would appeal the decision, and the Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved copycat versions of the drug.  Still, the decision was a setback for the company, whose stock dipped more than 5 percent on the news. Restasis is Allergan’s second best-selling product, behind the wrinkle treatment Botox, bringing in nearly $1.5 billion in 2016.  In September, Allergan took the highly unusual step of paying the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe in upstate New York to take possession of the patents, which then were leased back to the company.

Behar suggested that Eminem was being brave because literally no one in Hollywood or the music industry has taken such a stand, “That’s why you need to give him [Eminem] credit because very few people in the industry will go out and say, ‘I don’t care if you don’t support me.

Whoopi then embarrassed herself again when she tried to prove how many conservatives are working in Hollywood. The first example she used was comedian Tim Allen, whose top-rated show, “Last Man Standing” was just clearly canceled by ABC for political reasons. Whoopi then attempted to think of a second conservative actor and stumbled to finally land on Tom Selleck who hasn’t acted in a major movie or television show for decades. Selleck’s career peaked in the 1990’s. Outside of his occasional appearances on “Friends” as Monica’s boyfriend, Selleck’s career has been almost non-existent.

Texas Republican Rep. Brian Babin, who began drafting a letter on the matter and gathering signatures over the summer, apparently has sent it -- with the support of 18 House colleagues.  The Oct. 13-dated letter was sent to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va.  In the letter, Babin asks that one or both committees hold one or more hearings with Mueller and his team, while acknowledging that some questions regarding sensitive information from the case should not be addressed.  However, he argues that Americans deserve information and accountability because, “They are, after all, paying for it.”  “This team has sweeping authority and an open-ended mission, yet they are allowed to operate largely in secret,” the letter states.  Co-signers on the letter include Reps. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., and Trent Franks, R-Ariz.  Mueller’s team has for roughly five months been conducting the investigation into Russian inteference and possible collusion with Trump associates during the 2016 presidential campaign.  Babin’s office shared the letter with  on Tuesday, one day after President Trump again denied any such accusations.  “There’s been absolutely no collusion,” the president said Monday at a Rose Garden press conference. “They ought to get to the end of [the investigation] because the American people are sick of it.”  Babin, a two-term congressman, argues in the four-paragraph letter that every nominee for U.S. attorney must be vetted and confirmed by the Senate. However, Mueller and his legal team -- “who are arguably just as empowered” -- have given Congress no such opportunity, he writes, while raising concerns about ""possible conflicts"" and ""political bias.""  Several members of Mueller’s team have given to campaigns or political action committees associated with Democratic politicians like Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama.  Mueller, a former FBI director, was appointed in May after Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the probe.

The late Robert Morin, a 50-year staff member of the Dimond Library at the University of New Hampshire, shocked the community after his passing when they learned that he had left his entire $4 million fortune to the school. Morin, who was also a graduate of the university, asked that $100,000 of his fortune go directly to the library. He told his financial advisor that he trusted the school to “figure out what to do with” the rest.  Administrators drew the ire of students and alumni when they announced that they had decided to use $1 million of Morin’s gift for a video scoreboard for the school’s newly renovated football stadium. Community members weren’t happy with the decision, arguing that the stadiums $25 million budget should have been more than enough.  “Apparently, $25 million just wasn’t enough,” wrote one graduate, arguing that the decision is “a complete disgrace to the spirit and memory of Robert Morin.”  Another University of New Hampshire alumnus echoed the same sentiment: “I am not inherently opposed to some of the money going to the football program. I am opposed to it going to a scoreboard which, in the age of planned obsolescence, will be out of date in 5? 10? Years.”  “Use it to endow a scholarship for a player who wants to go to grad school maybe. … Pay it forward; make it meaningful,” she added.  Administrators at the University of New Hampshire tried to justify the decision by claiming that Morin became a passionate fan of the school’s football team in the last 15 months of his life. “In the last 15 months of his life Morin lived in an assisted living center where he started watching football games on television, mastering the rules and names of the players and teams,” the school wrote in a 2016 press release.  An investigative piece on the controversy published this week by Deadspin argues that the university used Morin as a marketing prop. “It was on measures like this that UNH cheated Morin by treating him less like a human being than a marketing prop,” author Craig Fehrman wrote. “This treatment had started early, of course, during those initial PR huddles, and it only got worse once a real backlash to the scoreboard emerged.”  “The librarian’s fandom had absolutely nothing to do with the scoreboard,” Fehrman added, “but through a careful and shameless juxtaposition, UNH implied that it had.”  Fortunately, $2.5 million from the gift will go towards a new career center for University of New Hampshire students and alumni.",http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2017/10/16/university-of-new-hampshire-uses-librarians-4-million-donation-for-football-stadium/

2143,Muf,,12,31,2099,MESSAGE TO HOLLYWOOD GOES VIRAL ,"This is the best yet! A message to Hollywood that went viral. It covers most of the things we think of when we think of the hypocrisy that runs rampant there:    Hollywood:        *    Email *  Phone      You lecture us about our carbon footprints while flying on private jets.  You preach feminism while brutalizing women.  You castigate violence while making millions off it in your movies.  You condemn guns, with armed bodyguards at your side.  You are the problem, not us.  WELL SAID!  LIBERAL HOLLYWOOD HAD THE WORST SUMMER IN 25 YEARS:  With the list of Hollywood actors and entertainers that Americans have decided to boycott over their sickening public hate for our President, is it really any wonder we’re seeing the worst box office numbers in 25 years?  Meryl Streep used her allotted time for accepting her lifetime achievement award at the Golden Globes to trash President Trump. At the start of her dramatic speech, Streep bemoaned to her fellow liberals that Hollywood “belong to one of the most vilified segments in America right now”. It appears that she hit may have actually the nail on the head. The problem with arrogant actresses like Meryl Streep who falsely believe that because they’ve been gifted with exceptional acting abilities, that Americans should fall in line with their radical political beliefs or we are ignorant.  ""As my friend…Princess Leia said to me once: take your broken heart, make it into art."" #MerylStreep pic.twitter.com/GzOHo7O729 #GoldenGlobes — Richard Hine (@richardhine) January 9, 2017  And then there’s Robert DiNero, who called candidate Trump “a punk,” “a pig” and “an idiot.” Only days before the election, DiNero angrily admitted that he would like to assault our soon to be President, claiming, “I’d like to punch him in the face”.  The list of Hollywood losers who have made vile, unfounded and even threatening remarks against a man who has put his very successful life on hold in an effort to save our nation is vast. The list of Hollywood losers who have said they would like to harm our President is also rather significant, starting with Madonna who got a visit from the secret service after she told a large, adoring group of women at the Women’s March in DC, that she’d like to blow up the White House.  And then there’s “comedian” Kathy Griffin, who saw her career literally blow up after making an ISIS style video holding up a decapitated and bloodied head of President Trump.  Is Hollywood’s rapidly declining appeal really so surprising to most Americans who are 100% FED UP with their hate for middle-America?  As Hollywood wraps up the all-important summer box-office season this Labor Day weekend, a sobering reality has gripped the industry.  The number of tickets sold in the United States and Canada this summer is projected to fall to the lowest level in a quarter-century.  The results have put the squeeze on the nation’s top theater chains, whose stocks have taken a drubbing. AMC Theatres Chief Executive Adam Aron this month called his company’s most recent quarter “simply a bust.”  Such blunt language reflects some worrisome trends. Domestic box-office revenue is expected to total $3.78 billion for the first weekend of May through Labor Day — a key period that generates about 40% of domestic ticket sales — down nearly 16% from the same period last year, according to comScore. That’s an even worse decline than the 10% drop some studio executives predicted before the summer began. –LA Times  Breitbart – Even before this catastrophic Labor Day weekend is factored in (more on this below), the domestic 2017 box office is in hideous shape. This year is –6.3% behind 2016 and continues to fall behind 2015, 2013, and 2012.  If you figure in inflation, those numbers are even worse. For example, in 2012 the average ticket cost $7.96. Today it is almost a full dollar more at $8.89. Yeah, things are that bad and will look even worse on Tuesday.  With no apparent faith in their own product, this is the first Labor Day in 25 years where a new title has not been released on more than 1,000 screens. Over this weekend last year, the box office hauled in nearly $130 million. This year will do about a third of that.  Summer attendance is at a 25-year low.  The summer box office is down a whopping –16% compared to 2016.  Can a handful of titles — It, Kingsman 2, Bladerunner 2, Thor 3, Justice League, Star Wars 8 — save an entire year? Doubtful. Pull out of a dive? Maybe. Still, we are talking about only six big titles over four months, which is about on par with last year’s Passengers, Rogue One, Doctor Strange, Fantastic Beasts, Inferno, Sully, and Magnificent Seven.",https://100percentfedup.com/message-hollywood-goes-viral/
2145,Muf,,12,31,2099,JOHN MCCAIN EXPLODES ON YOUNG FOX REPORTER: Calls Him 'Dumb' And 'Stupid' For Asking If His Votes Are Protest of Trump  ,"WOW! The truth hurts! John McCain becomes a total ass when asked by Fox reporter Peter Doocy if his votes are a protest of President Trump:    IN CASE TYOU DIDN’T CATCH THAT:  Senator John McCain: “Why would you say something that stupid? Why would you ask something that dumb? Huh? My job as a United States senator as a senator from Arizona which I was just reelected to. You think that I would somehow behave in a way that I would block everything just because of some personal disagreement? That’s a dumb question.”        *          Doocy’s question really isn’t too far off. We could begin with McCain’s shocking vote for keeping Obamacare. Since then, the war of words between President Trump and McCain has only gotten more heated.  OUR LATEST ON THE FEUD BETWEEN THE SENATOR AND THE PRESIDENT:  President Trump hit back at Senator John McCain in a pointed statement that should make it clear that Trump isn’t playing around with globalist RINO McCain anymore. You can’t blame Trump because McCain just keeps nipping at his heels with swipes trying to undermine Trump’s policies. RINO McCain famously demolished the latest effort to repeal and replace Obamacare in a dramatic show during the vote. McCain came onto the floor at the end of the Senate vote and voted no with a dramatic thumbs down motion.  McCain has been at odds with Trump since Trump questioned McCains status as a war hero. It seems McCain has had it out for Trump ever since.  Another bombshell on the McCain/Trump feud hypothesizes that the Trump Dossier could have come from McCain.  The latest slam to Trump happened just last night during a speech McCain gave. McCain called out Trump’s nationalism but it didn’t take long for Trump to respond:  President Donald Trump on Tuesday issued a warning shot after Republican Sen. John McCain questioned “half-baked, spurious nationalism” in America’s foreign policy.  Trump said in a radio interview with WMAL in Washington that “people have to be careful because at some point I fight back.” The president added “I’m being very, very nice but at some point I fight back and it won’t be pretty.”  MANY QUESTIONS RAISED ON MCCAIN’S STORY OF CAPTIVITY  Trump could be referring to new questions about McCain’s captivity in Vietnam. McCain has always been touted as a war hero for decades but many of the men who served when he did have raised questions about McCain.  McCain, a former Navy pilot who spent 5½ years in a Vietnam prisoner of war camp and is battling brain cancer, offered a simple response to Trump: “I have faced tougher adversaries.”  In Philadelphia on Monday night, the six-term Republican senator from Arizona received an award for a lifetime of service and sacrifice to the country. In addition to recalling his more than two decades of military service and his imprisonment during the war, McCain took a moment to go a step further than the night’s other speakers, who lamented what many described as a fractured political climate.  MCCAIN’S GLOBALIST WORD SALAD:  “To abandon the ideals we have advanced around the globe, to refuse the obligations of international leadership for the sake of some half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems,” he said, “is as unpatriotic as an attachment to any other tired dogma of the past that Americans consigned to the ash heap of history.”  He continued: “We live in a land made of ideals, not blood and soil.”  Former Vice President Joe Biden presented McCain with the Liberty Medal. Though members of opposing parties, the two men worked together during their time in the Senate. Former President Barack Obama, who defeated McCain in his bid for the presidency in 2008, congratulated the senator on the award in a tweet Monday night.  “I’m grateful to @SenJohnMcCain for his lifetime of service to our country. Congratulations, John, on receiving this year’s Liberty Medal,” Obama wrote.  Trump said in the radio interview that McCain voted against Republican efforts to dismantle Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act.  He says the vote was a “shocker.”  Read more: WT",https://100percentfedup.com/john-mccain-explodes-young-fox-reporter-calls-dumb-stupid-asking-votes-protest-trump-video/
2176,Muf,,12,31,2099,Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar explained what happens when humongous stars die,"All things die, even stars. When stars run out of hydrogen — the fuel that sustains the nuclear fusion reactors at their cores — they become unstable and collapse in on themselves. But not all stars collapse in the same way. Some of the most massive ones explode into a supernova and then collapse down into neutron stars, or black holes. We know this because of the work of astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, who would be 107 Thursday and is honored with a Google Doodle.  Chandrasekhar — an Indian-born scientist who spent 50 years at the University of Chicago — is most famous for coming up with the theory that explains the death of the universe’s most massive stars.  Before Chandrasekhar, scientists assumed that all stars collapsed into white dwarfs when they died. He determined this isn’t so.  On a long sea voyage from India to England in 1930 at the age of 19, he worked it out. According to the science of quantum mechanics, there are forces within the very atoms of the white dwarf star that counteract the force of gravity. Chandrasekhar determined this force would be overwhelmed if the star were massive enough.  He determined that any star remnants 1.4 times more massive than our sun would be too massive to form a stable white dwarf. After the limit, the force of gravity would cause the white dwarf to collapse.  “This discovery is basic to much of modern astrophysics, since it shows that stars much more massive than the Sun must either explode or form black holes,” NASA explains.  (For a more technical description of Chandrasekhar’s methodology, check out this great PBS story.)  This figure — 1.4 times the mass of our sun — is now known as the “Chandrasekhar limit,” and it’s key to understanding the evolution of stars in our universe. Beyond this limit, stars at the end of their lives either explode into a supernova or explode and then collapse into a neutron star or even a black hole.  Neutron stars are some of the weirdest objects in the universe. They’re small — just 15 or so miles across — but contain a mass equal to the sun. A teaspoon of neutron star weighs around 10 million tons. They’re so dense that the only things that can exist inside of them are neutrons, which are protons and electrons fused together. (The LIGO gravitational wave observatory just witnessed two of them crashing into each other. Subsequent observations showed that this collision actually contained the right energy and conditions to create heavy elements like gold and platinum.)  At the time of his discovery in the 1930s, Chandrasekhar didn’t know what, exactly, these massive stars would turn into once they spent all their fuel.  Initially, his idea was met with ridicule.  Sir Arthur Eddington, a physicist whose experimental work was key in proving Einstein’s theory of general relativity, openly mocked Chandrasekhar’s theory at a meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1935.  ""The star has to go on radiating and radiating and contracting and contracting until, I suppose, it gets to a few kilometers' radius, when gravity becomes strong enough to hold the radiation and the star can at last have peace,"" Eddington said, inadvertently describing the very thing Chandrasekhar’s limit would explain: the creation of black holes. “I think there should be a law of Nature to prevent a star from behaving in this absurd way!” he added. (There isn’t.)  This incident was so embarrassing for the young Chandrasekhar that he almost quit the field, the New York Times explains. (Chandrasekhar and Eddington would eventually make amends.)  Of course, scientists would go on to find more and more evidence of the existence of black holes and neutron stars. And for his work, Chandrasekhar won half of the 1983 Nobel Prize in physics. His theory represents one of the very early, important steps in our understanding of black holes and neutron stars.  And today his name adorns one of NASA’s prized space telescopes: The Chandra X-ray Observatory, whose data has contributed to the most spectacular images we have of dying stars exploding into supernovas.  This is the Crab Nebula, the result of a supernova explosion 4,500 light-years away from Earth.  Chandrasekhar was a prolific writer — he published more than a dozen textbooks on a range of topics in physics — and a devoted teacher (having once regularly driven a 100-mile round trip just to teach a class with two students), the University of Chicago explains. He was also the editor of the prestigious Astrophysical Journal for two decades. He passed away in 1995.  When he accepted the Nobel Prize in 1983, Chandrasekhar chose to read aloud a poem he had memorized from his youth in India. It was by Rabindranath Tagore, an Indian who won the Nobel prize for literature in 1913.

2181,Muf,,12,31,2099,There’s a highly successful treatment for opioid addiction. But stigma is holding it back.,"“I’m sick of going to funerals.”  If you ask Jordan Hansen why he changed his mind on medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction, this is the bottom line.  Several years ago, Hansen was against the form of treatment. If asked back then what he thought about it, he would have told you that it’s ineffective — and even harmful — for drug users. Like other critics, to Hansen, medication-assisted treatment was nothing more than substituting one drug (say, heroin) with another (methadone).  Today, not only does Hansen think this form of treatment is effective, but he readily argues — as the scientific evidence overwhelmingly shows — that it’s the best form of treatment for opioid addiction. He believes this so strongly, in fact, that he now often leads training sessions for medication-assisted treatment across the country.  “It almost hurts to say it out loud now, but it’s the truth,” Hansen told me, describing his previous beliefs. “I was kind of absorbing the collective fear and ignorance from the culture at large within the recovery community.”  Hansen is far from alone. Over the past few years, America’s harrowing opioid epidemic — now the deadliest drug overdose crisis in the country’s history — has led to a lot of rethinking about how to deal with addiction. For addiction treatment providers, that’s led to new debates about the merits of the abstinence-only model — many of which essentially consider addiction a failure of willpower — so long supported in the US.  Related How to stop the deadliest drug overdose crisis in American history  The Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation, which Hansen works for, exemplifies the debate. As one of the top drug treatment providers in the country, it used to subscribe almost exclusively to the abstinence-only model, based on an interpretation of the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous popularized in American addiction treatment in the past several decades. But in 2012, Hazelden announced a big switch: It would provide medication-assisted treatment.  “This is a huge shift for our culture and organization,” Marvin Seppala, chief medical officer of Hazelden, said at the time. “We believe it’s the responsible thing to do.”  From the outside, this might seem like a bizarre debate: Okay, so addiction treatment providers are supporting a form of treatment that has a lot of evidence behind it. So what?  But the growing embrace of medication-assisted treatment is demonstrative of how the opioid epidemic is forcing the country to take another look at its inadequate drug treatment system. With so many people dying from drug overdoses — tens of thousands a year — and hundreds of thousands more expected to die in the next decade, America is finally considering how its response to addiction can be better rooted in science instead of the moralistic stigmatization that’s existed for so long.  The problem is that the moralistic stigmatization is still fairly entrenched in how the US thinks about addiction. But the embrace of medication-assisted treatment shows that may be changing — and America may be finally looking at addiction as a medical condition instead of a moral failure.  The research is clear: Medication-assisted treatment works  One of the reasons opioid addiction is so powerful is that users feel like they must keep using the drugs in order to stave off withdrawal. Once a person’s body grows used to opioids but doesn’t get enough of the drugs to satisfy what it’s used to, withdrawal can pop up, causing, among other symptoms, severe nausea and full-body aches. So to avoid suffering through it, drug users often seek out drugs like heroin and opioid painkillers — not necessarily to get a euphoric high, but to feel normal and avoid withdrawal. (In the heroin world, this is often referred to as “getting straight.”)  Medications like methadone and buprenorphine (also known as Suboxone) can stop this cycle. Since they are opioids themselves, they can fulfill a person’s cravings and stop withdrawal symptoms. The key is that they do this in a safe medical setting, and when taken as prescribed do not produce the euphoric high that opioids do when they are misused. By doing this, an opioid user significantly reduces the risk of relapse, since he doesn’t have to worry about avoiding withdrawal anymore. Users can take this for the rest of their lives, or in some cases, doses may be reduced; it varies from patient to patient.  The research backs this up: Various studies, including systematic reviews of the research, have found that medication-assisted treatment can cut the all-cause mortality rate among addiction patients by half or more. Just imagine if a medication came out for any other disease — and, yes, health experts consider addiction a disease — that cuts mortality by half; it would be a momentous discovery.  “That is shown repeatedly,” Maia Szalavitz, a longtime addiction journalist and author of Unbroken Brain: A Revolutionary New Way of Understanding Addiction, told me. “There’s so much data from so many different places that if you add methadone or Suboxone in, deaths go down, and if you take it away, deaths go up.”  That’s why the biggest public health organizations — including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and the World Health Organization — all acknowledge medication-assisted treatment’s medical value. And experts often describe it as “the gold standard” for opioid addiction care.  The data is what drove Hansen’s change in perspective. “If I wanted to view myself as an ethical practitioner and doing the best that I could for the people I served, I needed to make this change based on the overwhelming evidence,” he said. “And I needed to separate that from my personal recovery experience.”  Medication-assisted treatment is different from traditional forms of dealing with addiction in America, which tend to demand abstinence. The standards in this field are 12-step programs, which combine spiritual and moralistic ideals into a support group for people suffering from addiction. While some 12-step programs allow medication-assisted treatment, others prohibit it as part of their demand for total abstinence. The research shows this is a particularly bad idea for opioids, for which medications are considered the standard of care.  There are different kinds of medications for opioids, which will work better or worse depending on a patient’s circumstances. Methadone, for example, is only administered in a clinic, typically one to four times a day — but that means patients will have to make the trip to a clinic on a fairly regular basis. Buprenorphine is a take-home drug that’s taken once or twice a day, but the at-home access also means it might be easier to misuse and divert to the black market.  One rising medication, known as extended-release naltrexone or its brand name Vivitrol, isn’t an opioid — making it less prone to misuse — and only needs to be injected once a month. But it also requires full detoxification to use (usually three to 10 days of no opioid use), while buprenorphine only requires a partial detoxification process (usually 12 hours to two days). And instead of preventing withdrawal — indeed, the detox process requires going through withdrawal — it blocks the effects of opioids up to certain doses, making it much harder to get high or overdose on the drugs.  The first US-based study comparing naltrexone and buprenorphine found that once people get on either, they are similarly effective. But that comes with a major caveat: It was much harder to get people started on naltrexone than buprenorphine because naltrexone requires a detox period. So buprenorphine is, on average, more accessible and effective than naltrexone — although results can vary from individual to individual.  One catch is that even these medications, though the best forms of opioid addiction treatment, do not work for as much as 40 percent of opioid users. Some patients may prefer not to take any medications because they see any drug use whatsoever as getting in the way of their recovery, in which case total abstinence may be the right answer for them. Others may not respond well physically to the medications, or the medications may for whatever reason fail to keep them from misusing drugs.  This isn’t atypical in medicine. What works for some people, even the majority, isn’t always going to work for everyone. So these are really first-line treatments, but in some cases patients may need alternative therapies if medication-assisted treatment doesn’t work. (That might even involve prescription heroin — which, while it’s perhaps counterintuitive, the research shows it works to mitigate the problems of addiction when provided in tightly controlled, supervised medical settings.)  Medication can also be paired with other kinds of treatment to better results. It can be used in tandem with cognitive behavioral therapy or similar approaches, which teach drug users how to deal with problems or settings that can lead to relapse. All of that can also be paired with 12-step programs like AA and NA or other support groups in which people work together and hold each other accountable in the fight against addiction. It all varies from patient to patient.  Why medication-assisted treatment is not just replacing one drug with another  The main criticism of medication-assisted treatment is that it’s merely replacing one drug with another. Former Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price echoed this criticism, saying, “If we’re just substituting one opioid for another, we’re not moving the dial much. Folks need to be cured so they can be productive members of society and realize their dreams.” (A spokesperson for Price later walked back the statement, saying Price supports all kinds of treatment.)  On its face, this argument is true. Medication-assisted treatment is replacing one drug, whether it’s opioid painkillers or heroin, with another, such as methadone or buprenorphine.  But this isn’t by itself a bad thing.  Under the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, it’s not enough for someone to be using or even physically dependent on drugs to qualify for a substance use disorder, the technical name for addiction. After all, most US adults use drugs — some every day or multiple times a day — without any problems whatsoever. Just think about that next time you sip a beer, glass of wine, coffee, tea, or any other beverage with alcohol or caffeine in it, or any time you use a drug to treat a medical condition.  The qualification for a substance use disorder is that someone is using drugs in a dangerous or risky manner. So someone with an opioid use disorder would not just be using opioids but potentially using these drugs in a way that puts him or others in danger — perhaps by feeling the need to commit crimes to obtain the drugs or using the drugs so much that he puts himself at risk of overdose and inhibits his day-to-day functioning. Basically, the drug use has to hinder someone from being a healthy, functioning member of society to qualify as addiction.  The key with medication-assisted treatment is that while it does involve continued drug use, it turns that drug use into a much safer habit. So instead of stealing to get heroin or using painkillers so much that he puts his life at risk, a patient on medication-assisted treatment can simply use methadone or buprenorphine to meet his physical cravings and otherwise go about his day — going to school, work, or any other obligations.  Yet this myth of the dangers of medication-assisted treatment remains prevalent — to deadly results.  In 2013, Judge Frank Gulotta Jr. in New York ordered an opioid user arrested for drugs, Robert Lepolszki, off methadone treatment, which he began after his arrest. In January 2014, Lepolszki died of a drug overdose at 28 years old — a direct result, Lepolszki’s parents say, of failing to get the medicine he needed. In his defense, Gulotta has continued to argue that methadone programs “are crutches — they are substitutes for drugs and drug cravings without enabling the participant to actually rid him or herself of the addiction.”  This is just one case, but it shows the real risk of denying opioid users medication: It can literally get them killed by depriving them of lifesaving medical care.  The myth is also a big reason why there are still restrictions on medication-assisted treatment. For example, the federal government still caps how many patients doctors can prescribe buprenorphine to, with strict rules about raising the cap. This limits how accessible the treatment is. A HuffPost analysis found that even if every doctor who can prescribe buprenorphine did so at the maximum rate in 2012, more than half of Americans with opioid use disorders could not get the medication.  That’s on top of barriers to addiction treatment in general. According to a 2016 report by the surgeon general, just 10 percent of Americans with a drug use disorder obtain specialty treatment. The report attributed the low rate to severe shortages in the supply of care — which can lead to waiting periods of weeks or even months.  The medications used in treatment do carry some risks  None of this is to say that the medications used in these treatments are without any problems whatsoever.  Methadone is tied to some misuse and thousands of deadly overdoses a year — although mostly when it’s used for pain, not addiction, treatment, because it’s more regulated in addiction care.  Buprenorphine is safer in that, unlike common painkillers, heroin, and methadone, its effect has a ceiling — meaning it has no significant effect after a certain dose level. But it’s still possible to misuse, particularly for people with lower tolerance levels. And there are some reports of buprenorphine mills, where patients can get buprenorphine for misuse from unscrupulous doctors — similar to how pill mills popped up during the beginning of the opioid epidemic and provided patients easy access to painkillers.  Naltrexone, meanwhile, can heighten the risk of overdose and death in case of full relapse. Overdose and death are risks in any case of relapse, but they’re particularly acute for naltrexone because it requires a full detox process that eliminates prior tolerance. (Although this would typically require someone to stop taking naltrexone, since otherwise it blocks the effects of opioids up to certain doses.)  But when taken as prescribed, the medications are broadly safe and effective for addiction treatment. For regulators, it’s a matter of making sure the drugs aren’t diverted into misuse, while also providing good access to people who genuinely need them.  The fight over medication-assisted treatment is really about how we see addiction  Behind the arguments about medication-assisted treatment is a simple reality of how Americans view addiction: Many still don’t see it, as public health officials and experts do, as a disease.  With other diseases, there is no question that medication can be a legitimate answer. That medication is not viewed as a proper answer by many to addiction shows that people believe addiction is unique in some way — particularly, they view addiction as at least partly a moral failing instead of just a disease.  I get emails all the time to this effect. Here, for example, is a fairly representative reader message: “Darwin’s Theory says ‘survival of the fittest.’ Let these lost souls pay the price of their criminal choices and criminal actions. Society does not owe them multiple medical resuscitations from their own bad judgment, criminal activity, and self-inflicted wounds.”  This contradicts what addiction experts broadly agree on. As Stanford psychiatrist and Drug Dealer, MD author Anna Lembke put it, “If you see somebody who continues to use despite their lives being totally destroyed — losing their jobs, losing loved ones, ending up in jail — nobody would choose that. Nobody anywhere would ever choose that life. So clearly it is beyond this individual’s control on some level.”  Many Americans may understand this with, say, depression and anxiety. We know that people with these types of mental health problems are not in full control of their thoughts and emotions. But many don’t realize that addiction functions in a similar way — only that the thoughts and emotions drive someone to seek out drugs at just about any cost.  Some of the sentiment against medications, as Hansen can testify, is propagated by people suffering from addiction. Some of them believe that any drug use, even to treat addiction, goes against the goal of full sobriety. They may believe that if they got sober without medications, perhaps others should too. Many of them also don’t trust the health care system: If they got addicted to drugs because a doctor prescribed them opioid painkillers, they have a good reason to distrust doctors who are now trying to get them to take another medication — this time for their addiction.  The opioid epidemic, however, has gotten a lot of people in the addiction recovery world to reconsider their past beliefs. Funeral after funeral and awful statistic after awful statistic, there is a sense that there has to be a better way — and by looking at the evidence, many have come to support medication-assisted treatment.  “I remember sitting there,” Hansen said, speaking to his experience at a funeral, as a mother sang her dead son a lullaby, “thinking that we have to do better.”",https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/7/20/15937896/medication-assisted-treatment-methadone-buprenorphine-naltrexone

(Hilcorp Alaska Inc. via AP)  ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — America within a few years could be extracting oil from federal waters in the Arctic Ocean, but it won’t be from a remote drilling platform.  Federal regulators are taking comments on a draft environmental statement for the Liberty Project, a proposal by a subsidiary of Houston-based Hilcorp to create an artificial gravel island that would hold production wells, a processing facility and the start of an undersea pipeline carrying oil to shore and connections to the trans-Alaska pipeline.  The drilling would be the first in federal Arctic waters since Royal Dutch Shell, amid protest both in the United States and abroad, in 2015 sent down an exploratory well in the Chukchi Sea off Alaska’s northwest coast.  Supporters like its chances. A final decision is in the hands of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. President Barak Obama in December signed an executive order designating the bulk of U.S. Arctic Ocean waters indefinitely off-limits to future oil and gas leasing. But President Donald in April signed another order aimed at reversing the policy. Zinke said Trump’s actions would put the country on track for energy independence.  Opponents say Arctic offshore oil should stay in the ground, where it won’t add greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming and the melting of sea ice, the habitat of polar bears and walruses. They say spills are inevitable and cannot be cleaned up in icy Arctic water.  Opponents also question Hilcorp’s safety record. State authorities this year fined the company $200,000 for violations at another production site. Hilcorp also waited several months to address an undersea pipeline leaking millions of cubic feet of processed natural gas in Alaska’s Cook Inlet because of danger to divers, Lois Epstein, Arctic program director for The Wilderness Society, said at an Anchorage hearing.  “This ongoing gas release into Cook Inlet, visible from the air, was a national embarrassment for Alaska,” she said.  The gas leaked from a pipeline supplying fuel to Hilcorp production platforms. The company confirmed the leak in February and lowered pressure in the line but waited until April to make repairs because of the threat to divers from floating ice. The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation to date has found no evidence the leak harmed birds, fish or marine mammals.  The latest project is on federal leases sold in the 1990s. Hilcorp proposes to create the island about 15 miles (24 kilometers) east of Prudhoe Bay, North America’s largest oil field. BP Exploration Alaska drilled at the site in 1997 and sold 50 percent of the assets to Hilcorp in 2014.  The island’s base on the ocean floor would be 24 acres, about the size of 18 football fields, with sloped sides leading to a work surface of 9 acres, the size of nearly seven football fields.  Trucks would travel by ice road to a hole cut in sea ice and deposit 83,000 cubic yards (63,450 million cubic meters) of gravel into 19 feet (6 meters) of water to create the island. A wall would fend off ice, waves and wildlife.  The island would be 5.6 miles (9 kilometers) off shore. The surface would have room for 16 wells, including five to eight conventional production wells. At peak production, Hilcorp anticipates extracting 60,000 to 70,000 barrels per day for a total recovery of 80 million to 150 million barrels over 15 to 20 years.  Oil would reach shore by a pipe encased by a second pipe and equipped with a leak detection systems. It would be buried to prevent gouging by moving ice.  At the end of production, the company would remove equipment and the wall and let waves and ice dismantle the island.  At a public hearing on the project last week, Joshua Kendrick, an attorney for the Alaska Oil and Gas Association, said opposition testimony has focused on rhetoric. Liberty would be the 19th artificial drilling island in Alaska, including four now pumping oil from state waters. Decisions should be made by data and science, he said, and Hilcorp is not proposing something novel.  “This isn’t venturing into new waters. Anyone who sells fear or the least likely outcome to discourage these types of investments coming forward is doing a disservice to Alaska, doing a disservice to the public,” he said.  Andy Mack, commissioner of the state Department of Natural Resources, said the body of information built up from wells on gravel islands in state waters should give people comfort about Liberty’s effects on marine mammals and the environment. Like other supporters, he touted Liberty’s economic benefits.  “Each of these facilities on its own, frankly, they’re not giant fields,” Mack said. “But they’re all very, very important to the economy of Alaska.”  Blake Upshaw of the Center for Biological Diversity said spills are inevitable and routine and cannot be cleaned up in Arctic waters.  “Oil companies have guaranteed safe operations to communities in Valdez, the Gulf of Mexico and Santa Barbara over the years, and we all know how projects in those locations turned out,” he said.  The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management will collect comment on its draft environmental review until Nov. 18.",https://www.apnews.com//6f62b3a23d854e74998a19fd7f1ac734/Oil-company-proposes-Arctic-drilling-from-artificial-island
2215,Phani,,12,31,2099,ONE BRAVE MAN Is About To Reveal The Truth About What REALLY Happened In Ferguson…Black Lives Matter and The Media Are NOT Going To Be Happy  ,"Thanks to one very brave journalist and filmmaker, FERGUSON, a very important and extremely controversial play, is set to begin in New York City on October 19 and will run through October 30th.  The New York version of FERGUSON is directed by Jerry Dixon.    Much like the contentious real-life drama that played out on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, when Michael Brown was shot dead by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, filmmaker Phelim McAleer’s controversial retelling of what really happened that fateful day in the Ferguson the play, using only the Grand Jury testimony from the Officer Wilson trial, is sure to ruffle some feathers.        *    Email *  Email      Black Lives Matter has been perpetuating a lie about Michael Brown and how he was a victim of murder at the hands of a white police officer, who had no grounds whatsoever to shoot him.  FERGUSON is a Verbatim Play – it only uses actual Grand Jury testimony from eyewitnesses who saw police officer Daren Wilson shoot Michael Brown. Most of these eyewitnesses are minorities and yet their accounts are totally at odds with the stories spun by the mainstream media and activists. This is why it is so important to bring the truth to New York. Obviously the New York theatrical establishment won’t support this play. They seem to really detest anything that challenges their cozy consensus world view.  Ferguson the play, was the brainchild of journalist and filmmaker Phelim McAleer, who many know for his hard-hitting documentary Fracknation, that pulled the curtain back on a false narrative being pushed by liberal activists and politicians, and exposed the truth behind the lies Americans were being told about the dangers of fracking.  Two years ago, when rehearsal began in Los Angeles for FERGUSON, McAleer found himself having to deal with 9 actors who walked out when rehearsals began, after reading the script (that is based on the verbatim Grand Jury testimony of the witnesses during the officer Wilson trial).  What makes FERGUSON so compelling, is that not one word of the Grand Jury testimony is altered or changed. McAleer, who was determined to keep the show alive, explains how difficult it has been to get his play to the New York stage:  McAleer tells viewers in the promotional video below, that the truth about what really happened in Ferguson is not what the mainstream media’s been telling you.: “The truth was so shocking to so many people, that 9 of the cast walked out during rehearsals in Los Angeles. I was determined that the show would go on, even though the cast walked out. And the cast walked out because what they wanted to believe, didn’t match the truth that was in the Grand Jury documents. They were so convinced by the media, of one version of events, and the truth didn’t matter to them, and they couldn’t handle it. So that’s why it’s so important to bring this to New York.”  Phelim goes on to remind viewers of how Mike Pence was attacked by the cast and audience when he went to see Hamilton in New York.  Despite the 9 members of the cast who walked out on the play in Los Angeles and the anger the play incited in many supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement, FERGUSON was very well-received by critics after its debut in Los Angeles.  Watch:  Phelim McAleer is asking for help to fund his FERGUSON production. Please consider making a contribution to this very worthy cause by clicking HERE to donate.  FERGUSON “made for a riveting spectacle and comes as a reminder both of the adversarial dramatic power that is inherent in any courtroom testimony and how even the dry language of a legal transcript can come alive when placed in the hands of skilled actors. Add a standing-room-only audience and the high stakes of this country’s ongoing debate about race, police profiling and its use of lethal force, and you’ve got the ingredients for an incendiary evening of theater.” -LA WEEKLY  Hopefully, FERGUSON the play will cause Americans to understand what really happened in Ferguson through the eyes of the people who testified to what they actually saw that day and not through the lies of the mainstream media and the false narrative of Black Lives Matter leaders and activists.",https://100percentfedup.com/one-brave-man-reveal-truth-really-happened-fergusonblack-lives-matter-media-not-going-happy-video/
2216,Phani,,12,31,2099,THEY KNEW! CLOSE CLINTON FRIEND Warned Against Agreeing To Allow Sexual Predator Harvey Weinstein To Host Fundraisers…They Did It Anyway ,"In June of 2016, the disgraced sexual predator, and Hollywood producer, Harvey Weinstein, hosted a fundraiser for Hillary’s presidential campaign in Manhattan. Some of the top celebrities in the business accepted Harvey’s invitation to the event. Celebrity donors who were in attendance at the event included Leo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lopez, and Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick. Weinstein raised $1.8 million for Hillary at his star-studded fundraiser. When Hillary was asked if she was planning to give any of the money back or would give it to charity, the Clinton Foundation claimed they would not give back a cent, and that the money had already been spent on other “charitable purposes”. We’re wondering what, exactly the Clinton Foundation means by “charitable purposes”? Like Chelsea’s wedding that was partially funded by the Clinton Foundation?  A TV writer and close Clinton family friend says she warned at least three “top-level Democratic operatives” against allowing Harvey Weinstein to host fundraisers.    “A warning that evidently (and to the glee of Fox News) fell on deaf ears,” writes “Designing Women” creator Linda Bloodworth-Thomason in a new Hollywood Reporter op-ed.        *    Email *  Phone      Weinstein gave thousands and bundled $1.42 million in donations to Hillary Clinton’s presidential run, but the former secretary of state has said she had no idea about the producer’s predatory ways.  Bloodworth-Thomason, who has created political promotional films for both Clintons, said she helped President Bill Clinton pen an apology amid his own sex scandal and that his actions have “taxed my feminist conscience” — but she still loves him “dearly.”  She says she has long been aware of Weinstein’s lecherous ways and is skeptical of those now claiming ignorance.  “Some said this despite knowing him for decades, starring in his films and being friends with accusers who starred in his films,” she writes.  But although Weinstein was “at the top of the sexual predator food chain” she says the industry is rife with men like him.  “These kinds of atrocities against women routinely go unreported and unpunished in the entertainment industry. The No. 1 casting criterion in Hollywood is that, above all else, an actress must be ‘hot and f–kable,’” she writes. –Page Six",https://100percentfedup.com/knew-close-clinton-friend-warned-agreeing-allow-sexual-predator-harvey-weinstein-host-fundraisersthey-anyway/
2221,Phani,,12,31,2099,Senate Judiciary Committee Asks FBI Informant to Testify on Uranium One Deal,"Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) has asked the attorney of a former FBI informant if her client can testify before the committee about the FBI’s investigation into a bribery scheme by a Russian state-controlled company that was allowed to purchase 20 percent of the United States uranium supply in 2010.  The request, in a letter dated October 18, 2017, asks attorney Victoria Toensing to allow her client to testify about the information he provided to the FBI about members of the Rosatom subsidiary Tenex from 2009 until the FBI’s prosecution of defendants in 2014.  The client is an American businessman who went to the FBI immediately after Russian officials asked him to engage in illegal activity in 2009, according to the Hill, which disclosed the existence of the FBI investigation.  The businessman worked for four years undercover as an FBI confidential witness and signed a non-disclosure agreement that Obama Justice Department officials have threatened him not to break.  According to Toensing, her client has pertinent information that the Russians were attempting to gain access to former President Bill Clinton and his wife, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, to influence the Obama administration’s decision on the purchase of Uranium One.  Grassley’s letter reads:  Reporting indicates that “the informant’s work was crucial to the government’s ability to crack a multimillion dollar racketeering scheme by Russian nuclear officials on U.S. soil” and that the scheme involved “bribery, kickbacks, money laundering, and extortion.” Further, the reporting indicates that your client can testify that “FBI agents made comments to him suggesting political pressure was exerted during the Justice Department probe” and “that there was specific evidence that could have scuttled approval of the Uranium One deal.” It appears that your client possesses unique information about the Uranium One/Rosatom transaction and how the Justice Department handled the criminal investigation into the Russian criminal conspiracy. Such information is critical to the Committee’s oversight of the Justice Department and its ongoing inquiry into the manner in which CFIUS approved the transaction. Accordingly, the Committee requests to interview your client. Please contact Committee staff by October 25, 2017, to arrange the interview.  Grassley also sent another letter on Tuesday to Attorney General Jeff Sessions requesting that he release Toensing’s client from the non-disclosure agreement. He wrote in the letter:  These restrictions appear to improperly prevent the individual from making critical, good faith disclosures to Congress of potential wrongdoing. They also purport to limit the Committee’s access to information it needs to fulfill its constitutional responsibility of oversight. This Committee has oversight jurisdiction of the Justice Department, and if this NDA does in fact exist, it hinders the Committee’s ability to do its job. Accordingly, please provide a copy of the NDA by November 1, 2017. In addition, should the NDA exist, I request that you release him from it and pledge not to engage in any form of retaliation against him for good faith communications with Congress.  Grassley told Sessions on Wednesday that he wants to know why the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) approved the Rosatom purchase of Uranium One despite the existence of an FBI investigation which could have impacted the approval.  At the time of the Uranium One deal, CFIUS was chaired by then-Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and included then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and then-Attorney General Eric Holder.  According to Circa, the FBI by 2010 had “gathered enough evidence to prove that Rosatom-connected officials were engaged in a global bribery schedule that included kickbacks and money laundering. Despite that, the U.S. government approved the sale.”  Uranium One controlled 20 percent of the U.S. uranium supply under U.S. law, and its sale to Russian company Rosatom required approval by CFIUS, which reviews transactions leading to a change of control of a U.S. business to a foreign person or entity that may have an impact on the national security of the U.S.",http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/10/19/senate-judiciary-committee-asks-fbi-informant-testify-uranium-one-deal/

Tweeting out a mix of pro-Trump cheerleading, ordinary partisan content, Islamophobia, racism, and conspiracy theories, the account amassed at least 136,000 followers. Its tweets often racked up thousands of retweets, sometimes even from top Trump campaign staffers.  And it turns out a Russian organization was running it all along.  According to a new indictment of 13 Russian people and 3 Russian entities released by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team Friday, a Russian organization “created and controlled the Twitter account, ‘Tennessee GOP,’ which used the handle @TEN_GOP.”  Twitter finally shut down the @TEN_GOP account in August of last year, and two reports from BuzzFeed News and the Daily Beast have more on the details of what happened there.  But it’s worth taking a look back at just what this Russian account was putting out there, both before the election and after it.  A review of many of its past tweets reveal some that appear to be deliberately advancing a pro-Russian propaganda agenda, and others that appear more aimed at staying “in character” in the fake identity of a Tennessee Republican. (It’s hard to see the propaganda purpose in, for instance, a tweet saying the late Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds are “singin the rain in the heavens now.”)  And despite occasional spelling or grammatical flubs (which, in fairness, native-born American accounts sometimes make too), there’s a perhaps surprising amount of sophistication in how @TEN_GOP understood US political dynamics, and how it attempted to make mischief.

The Russian account wants you to know that Russians didn’t interfere with the election  The Russian account supports the firing of James Comey  The Russian account does not want Julian Assange prosecuted  The Russian account likes Marine Le Pen and likes Trump’s position on NATO  The Russian account is often just flat-out racist or Islamophobic  The Russian account often spread anti-Democrat conspiracy theories  The Russian account is also sometimes just totally random",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/19/16504510/ten-gop-twitter-russia

2285,Phani,,12,31,2099,James Comey Claimed ‘No Special’ Rules for Clinton Just Days After Drafting Statement Excusing Her Mishandling of Classified Info,"Former FBI Director James Comey claimed last year there was “no special set of rules” for Hillary Clinton, just nine days after he circulated a draft statement of the statement that would exonerate her for her email use — a statement drafted before several key interviews.  Comey was asked by Fox News’ Catherine Herridge in May 2016 whether Clinton, in connection with the investigation into her use of a private email server when she was secretary of state, would be subject to a special set of rules because she is “powerful and politically connected.”  “I’m not going to comment, other than to say there are no special set of rules for anybody that the FBI investigates,” he replied.  Yet, the FBI revealed Monday that Comey had drafted the statement months before he interviewed Clinton and other key officials, with a release called “Drafts of Director Comeys [sic] July 5, 2016 Statement Regarding Email Server Investigation Part 01 of 01.”  While almost all of it is redacted, it an email titled “Midyear Exam — UNCLASSIFIED” sent from Comey on May 2, 2016, to a group including Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, general counsel James Baker and chief of staff James Rybicki.  The document also shows a May 16 response from Rybicki requests comments “so we may roll into a master doc for discussion with the Director at a future date.”  In that statement, eventually delivered in July, Comey blasted Clinton at length for being “extremely careless” with classified information when she served as secretary of state. However, crucially for Clinton and her presidential campaign, he did not recommend charges to the Justice Department.  The release appears to confirm the contents of a letter sent by Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) to FBI Director Christopher Wray in August in which he wrote that “it appears that in April or early May of 2016, Mr. Corney had already decided he would issue a statement exonerating Secretary Clinton.”  Fox News has since contacted Comey’s book agent asking Comey to explain the May 2 email, but did not receive a response.

He’s repeatedly gone low when it comes to President Trump. His manner of speaking is so crude and hateful that it’s pretty shocking to hear his speeches. We’ve reported on them before and have spoken about how Perez is a former La Raza guy who is a radical from a way back. He fights dirty and is one of Obama’s minions. If this is the direction the Democrats are going in…It’s pretty ugly.  “OUSTING ACTIVISTS”  Trending: DIRTY POLITICS: LEAKED AUDIO Exposes Attempted Cover-Up Of Dem Leader’s Sponsorship Of Bussed In Protesters  Trying to quell accusations that he is ousting activists from the party’s left flank, Democratic Chairman Tom Perez told fellow Democrats on Saturday that unity is crucial in the fight against President Donald Trump, whom he lambasted as an ‘existential threat’ to the nation.        *    Email *  Phone      “MOST DANGEROUS”  ‘We have the most dangerous president in American history and one of the most reactionary Congresses in American history,’  BERNIE SUPPORTERS OUSTED FROM PARTY LEADERSHIP  Perez said as he addressed the first Democratic National Committee gathering since his February election.  The former Obama Cabinet official blistered ‘a culture of corruption’ that he said extends to Trump’s Cabinet, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, but he warned that internal ruckuses over party priorities and leadership would distract from the goal of winning more elections to upend Republicans’ domination in Washington.  Those who have been pushed out include:  Ray Buckley, the New Hampshire Democratic chairman and longtime DNC official who ran against Perez for chair before backing Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn. Buckley lost his spots on the Executive Committee and DNC Rules Committee.

2387,Phani,,12,31,2099,Gavin Newsom Asks Court to Allow ‘High Capacity’ Magazine Ban,"Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom is asking that a court order against a “high capacity” magazine ban be lifted so the ban can take effect in California.  A “high capacity” magazine ban was set to go into effect in California on July 1 but was blocked by U.S. District Judge Roger Benitez, who ruled that the ban could not survive the test of District of Columbia v. Heller (2008).  News reported:  Heller was a ruling which reaffirmed that Second Amendment rights are individual rights that the government is prohibited from infringing. Heller struck down a Washington, DC, gun ban — demonstrating that federal districts are barred from infringing gun rights—and in 2010, the McDonald v Chicago ruling affirmed that states are barred from infringing said rights as well.  The “high capacity” magazine ban in California was passed by a majority of voters via Proposition 63, but Judge Benitez noted that Heller is a reminder that the Constitution is in place to shield rights from “the tyranny of the majority.”  Newsom wants the Benitez order lifted so the ban can take effect.  According to the Los Angeles Times, Newsom said the ban will “help prevent the occurrence of high-fatality gun massacres, and … [will] reduce the bloodshed when these tragedies occur.”  Note that Newsom’s claim contains an admission that the ban will not stop “high-fatality” attacks altogether. Rather, it is yet another in a long list of California controls that is promulgated in the name of safety, only to result in diminished freedom. The loss of freedom would result from the fact that only law-abiding citizens would follow a “high capacity” magazine ban, like any gun law, and law-abiding citizens are the very people who are not misusing “high capacity” magazines to begin with.  This was not lost on Judge Benitez, who said he blocked the ban because its implementation would have meant “hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of otherwise law-abiding citizens [would] have an untenable choice: become an outlaw or dispossess one’s self of lawfully acquired property.”  AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for  News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a  News podcast.

2391,Phani,,12,31,2099,"Cambridge Analytica, the shady data firm that might be a key Trump-Russia link, explained","The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has requested that a data analytics company called Cambridge Analytica turn over internal documents as part of its investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.  Cambridge Analytica specializes in what’s called “psychographic” profiling, meaning they use data collected online to create personality profiles for voters. They then take that information and target individuals with specifically tailored content (more on this below).  So far there’s been a lot of speculation about the potential links between the Trump campaign and Russia, and most of the stories have orbited around the financial dealings of the Trump family and people like Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign manager. But this story is specifically about how team Trump, with the help of this data company, might have facilitated Russia’s meddling in the US presidential election.  So here’s what we know about Cambridge Analytica, its connections to the Trump campaign, and what sorts of things Mueller is likely looking into.  Trump’s digital army  In June 2016, the Trump campaign hired Cambridge Analytica to take over its data operations.  We know from the reporting of Nicholas Confessore and Danny Hakim at the New York Times that Jared Kushner, who was charged with overseeing Trump’s digital operations, is the reason Cambridge Analytica joined the Trump campaign.  Kushner hired a man named Brad Parscale, a Texas-based digital expert who had worked previously for team Trump. According to Confessore and Hakim, Cambridge Analytica convinced Parscale (who has since agreed to be interviewed by the House Intelligence Committee) to “try out the firm.” The decision was reinforced by Trump’s campaign manager, Steve Bannon, who is also a former vice president of Cambridge Analytica.  It’s not clear to what extent Cambridge Analytica helped (Parscale denied that Cambridge was of any use in a recent 60 Minutes interview), but we do know that Trump’s digital operation was shockingly effective. Samuel Woolley, who heads the Computational Propaganda project at Oxford’s Internet Institute, found that a disproportionate amount of pro-Trump messaging was spread via automated bots and anti-Hillary propaganda. Trump’s bots, they reported at the time of the election, outnumbered Clinton’s five to one.  Pro-Trump programmers “carefully adjusted the timing of content production during the debates, strategically colonized pro-Clinton hashtags, and then disabled activities after Election Day.”  Martin Moore, director of the Centre for the Study of Media, Communication and Power at King’s College, told the Guardian’s Carole Cadwalladr that Trump’s campaign “was using 40-50,000 variants of ads every day that were continuously measuring responses and then adapting and evolving based on that response.”  These online ads were spread primarily through bots on social media platforms. The ads that got liked, shared, and retweeted the most were reproduced and redistributed based on where they were popular and who they appealed to.  The benefit of this kind of data is that it allows data companies like Cambridge Analytica to develop more sophisticated psychological profiles of internet users (more data points means more predictive power).  Cambridge Analytica was also able to use this real-time information to determine which messages were resonating where and then shape Trump’s travel schedule around it. So, if there was a spike in clicks on an article about immigration in a county in Pennsylvania or Wisconsin, Trump would go there and give an immigration-focused speech.  When you consider how a few thousands votes in a handful of swing states determined the election, this is no small thing.  Flynn and the Russians  In early July, Shane Harris of the Wall Street Journal released a series of reports that offered some of the most compelling evidence yet that Trump’s campaign colluded with Russian hackers.  Harris interviewed a man named Peter Smith, a pro-Trump GOP operative who sought to acquire the 30,000 deleted emails from Hillary Clinton’s private server. Of the several hacker groups Smith reached out to, at least two had connections to Russia — that’s according to Smith.  Smith told Harris that he was in regular contact with Gen. Michael Flynn, who at the time was one of Trump’s closest confidants — and of course later became Trump’s national security adviser.  Here’s a key passage from the Harris report, which my  colleague Andrew Prokop highlighted at the time:  “He [Smith] said, ‘I’m talking to Michael Flynn about this — if you find anything, can you let me know?’” said Eric York, a computer-security expert from Atlanta who searched hacker forums on Mr. Smith’s behalf for people who might have access to the emails. ... ...In phone conversations, Mr. Smith told a computer expert he was in direct contact with Mr. Flynn and his son, according to this expert. ... The expert said that based on his conversations with Mr. Smith, he understood the elder Mr. Flynn to be coordinating with Mr. Smith’s group in his capacity as a Trump campaign adviser.  Harris examined intelligence reports that described the efforts of Russian hackers to retrieve emails from Clinton’s server and pass them along to Flynn, who would then share them with the Trump campaign.  By itself, Harris’s reporting makes no connection to Cambridge Analytica. But in August the Associated Press published a report that helped connect the dots. In an amended public financial filing, Flynn was forced to disclose “a brief advisory role with a firm related to a controversial data analysis company that aided the Trump campaign.”  The “data analysis company” is none other than Cambridge Analytica. The precise amount of money Cambridge paid to Flynn is unknown, as are the details of Flynn’s role.  But we know that congressional and DOJ investigators believe that Trump’s campaign might have helped guide Russia’s voter targeting scheme and that Flynn, who worked for Trump’s campaign and with Cambridge Analytica, is suspected of having extensive ties with Russian operatives.  A Cambridge Analytica spokesperson confirmed to  that the company is cooperating with the Russia investigation but flatly denied any wrongdoing.  “As one of the companies that played a prominent role in the election campaign, Cambridge Analytica has been asked by the House Intelligence Committee to provide it with information that might help its investigation,” the statement said. “We believe that other organizations that worked on the campaign have been asked to do the same. CA is not under investigation, and there is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by the company.”  What does Cambridge Analytica actually do?  If you use the internet or social media, you leave behind a digital trail of crumbs. Every post you like, every tweet you retweet, every thread you participate in — it’s all data up for collection and input.  Cambridge Analytica, a company created by Robert Mercer, a billionaire patron of right-wing outlets like Breitbart News, has been swallowing up all the data they can get. They’re not the only company doing this, but they appear to be the most prominent — in part because of their high-profile clients.  In a 2016 speech, Alexander Nix, the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, unfurled the company’s methodology: “We’ve rolled out a long-form quantitative instrument to probe the underlying traits that inform personality,” he proclaimed. “If you know the personality of the people you’re targeting, you can nuance your messaging to resonate more effectively with those key groups.”  By “your message” he means whoever pays the company for its services. But so far the firm has only taken on Republican clients, with Ted Cruz and Ben Carson being the most visible. They also worked on behalf of 2016 pro-Brexit “Leave” campaign, mining online data and using it to target and persuade British voters.  So what are they doing with all that data?  Cambridge Analytica has built models that translate the data they harvest into personality profiles for every American adult — Nix claims to have “somewhere close to 4 or 5 thousand data points on every adult in the US.”  Their models are based on the psychometric research of Michal Kosinski, who in 2013 was still a PhD candidate at the University of Cambridge (hence the name “Cambridge Analytica”). Kosinski and his colleagues developed a model that linked subjects’ Facebook likes with their OCEAN scores. OCEAN refers to a questionnaire used by psychologists that describes personalities along five dimensions — openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism.  Cambridge Analytica has combined this social psychology with data analytics. They collect data from Facebook and Twitter (which is perfectly legal) and have purchased an array of other data — about television preferences, airline travel, shopping habits, church attendance, what books you buy, what magazines you subscribe to — from third-party organizations and so-called data brokers.  They take all this information and use it for what Nix calls “behavioral microtargeting” — basically individualized advertising.  Instead of tailoring ads according to demographics, they use psychometrics. It’s a simple idea, really. Rather than assuming that all women or African Americans or working-class whites will respond to the same message, they target individual voters with emotionally charged content — in other words, ads designed to tug on emotional biases.  The success of this approach hinges on the accuracy of the company’s psychological profiles. But how much can they know about someone’s psyche on the basis of a few tweets or likes? Quite a lot, apparently. In a 2016 profile for Das Magazin, a Zürich-based culture magazine, Kosinski talked about the predictive power of his model.  Here’s how the authors summed it up:  The strength of their [Kosinski and his Cambridge colleagues] modeling was illustrated by how well it could predict a subject's answers. Kosinski continued to work on the models incessantly: before long, he was able to evaluate a person better than the average work colleague, merely on the basis of ten Facebook ""likes."" Seventy ""likes"" were enough to outdo what a person's friends knew, 150 what their parents knew, and 300 ""likes"" what their partner knew. More ""likes"" could even surpass what a person thought they knew about themselves.  Combine this kind of predictive power with an army of bots and you’ve got a potent propaganda tool. As Woolley told me, “One person controlling a thousand bot accounts is able to not just affect the people in their immediate circle but also potentially the algorithm of the site on which their operating.”  Bots are even more effective, as they’re able to react instantly to trending topics on Twitter and Facebook, producing targeted posts, images, and even YouTube videos.  “The technologies can capture what people are thinking at a particular moment,” Albright told me, “and serve it back to them over and over again.” And with the benefit of psychographic profiling, he adds, they’re able to deliver “content on an individual basis on Twitter and Facebook feeds where people are being grabbed and pulled in certain directions through certain types of posts and stories.  “I’ve called it an emotional leash,” Woolley said.  There’s a lot we don’t know  We don’t know if Flynn actually passed any data to the Russians. Nor do we know if his numerous ties to Russia resulted in collusion.  We don’t know if the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russians to help their disinformation operation. We know only that there are many points of overlap. And if anyone in his campaign did coordinate with Russia, we don’t know if Trump himself was involved in any way.  We don’t know if the data produced by Cambridge Analytica ever found its way to Russians. And if it did, we don’t know for sure how it got there or how much it helped or if the company was aware of it.  We also don’t know how useful Cambridge Analytica’s work was to the Trump campaign. Researchers like Woolley told me that the company’s capabilities are a “bit overblown,” but we simply don’t know. We know only what they’ve admitted publicly about their methods and what they claim to be able to do.  One thing we do know is that data companies like Cambridge Analytica have changed things. Facebook is already under fire for allowing Russia to manipulate its algorithms during the 2016 election. And we’ve likely just scratched the surface in terms of how state actors are able to weaponize information online. The role of companies like Cambridge Analytica in these efforts remains something of a mystery, however.  In any event, no definitive evidence has emerged that connects Cambridge Analytica and the Trump campaign to Russia’s efforts to influence our election. What we’re left with, ultimately, is a ton of smoke and no fire. But if the ongoing investigations conclude that the Trump campaign did help Russia target voters, expect to hear more about Cambridge Analytica.  It’s entirely possible that such collusion could have occurred and the work of Cambridge Analytica had nothing to do with it; however, that would be strange, since targeting voters is precisely what the company was hired to do.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/16/15657512/cambridge-analytica-trump-kushner-flynn-russia
2394,Phani,,12,31,2099,"The “Fake Melania” conspiracy theory, explained","In a world where white supremacists use a cartoon frog to help convey their hateful beliefs, the president is obsessed with TV ratings and feuding with the NFL, and perceived threats of international nuclear warfare happen on Twitter, is it that far-fetched to believe that the first lady of the United States, Melania Trump, has a body double who takes her place at official Trump administration events?  No, say certain factions of the internet.  During a press event at a US Secret Service training facility on Wednesday, President Donald Trump spoke to reporters with his wife Melania (“Melania” to truthers) by his side. The televised spot caught the eye of a man named Joe Vargas, who tweeted that the “Melania Trump” who appeared at the event was not the real first lady, but an imposter lookalike:  This is not Melania. To think they would go this far & try & make us think its her on TV is mind blowing. Makes me wonder what else is a lie pic.twitter.com/JhPVmXdGit — BuyLegalMeds.com (@JoeVargas) October 18, 2017  Let me save you some time from looking it up. It's not her. pic.twitter.com/IJjHEzWs8p — BuyLegalMeds.com (@JoeVargas) October 18, 2017  Vargas’s tweets set certain parts of the internet ablaze.  The idea that a sunglasses-wearing changeling was masquerading as the first lady of the United States instantly made complete sense to many conspiracy theorists and people with a deep distrust for the government — think the types of folks who insist that the Earth is flat, or that molten jet fuel isn’t hot enough to melt steel beams. Vargas’s initial tweet was retweeted over 60,000 times.  After seeing this clip over 20 times, I have to say, I wouldn't be surprised if they used a Melania double. Fake Trash do things like that. https://t.co/zGqRiQz02j — Ricky Davila (@TheRickyDavila) October 18, 2017  Meanwhile, on the less earnest and more sarcastic end of the spectrum, there were myriad jokes and chortles as people dismissed the idea that Melania Trump had a body double but still found a way to turn “Melania” into their own jokes and fanfiction.  Me: conspiracy theories are stupid  Twitter: Donald Trump is going around with a fake Melania stunt double  Me: pic.twitter.com/9UdkMWWdVG — regina phalange (@rhcphaley) October 18, 2017  The resulting fascination with Melania versus “Melania” gave us that rare moment where absolute silliness collides with strange reality, resulting in an entertaining internet adventure. But it also added yet another chapter to the ongoing narrative that’s frequently been applied the first lady of the United States: one that revolves around the idea of her being an unwilling participant in her marriage and the current administration. It’s a theory that may say more about what we’re willing to project on Melania Trump than anything she’s ever done.  Relax, it’s totally (probably) Melania Trump  Vargas’s conspiracy theory about “Melania” gained traction almost immediately, and it’s not that difficult to see why. For one thing, it was prime fodder for our internet culture, which is always at the ready to turn anything and everything into a joke.  BREAKING    Fake Melania Trump revealed to be elusive criminal mastermind Carmen Sandiego: pic.twitter.com/NRdmUzdHla — TrumpsTaxes (@TrumpsTaxes) October 18, 2017  Me: I can't deal with all this fake news, it's harming American democracy    Twitter: Melania Trump has a body double    Me: pic.twitter.com/QMXROMyRe8 — Sam Stryker (@sbstryker) October 18, 2017  You don’t have to believe in “Melania” to appreciate the theory and joke about it. But that doesn’t really explain earnest “Melania” truthers.  Vargas’s initial tweet does.  Vargas refers to the Trump administration as “they,” an entity trying to trick the media, a.k.a. “them,” and by extension, the American people, a.k.a. “us.” This triangular relationship between the government, the media, and what both are telling the public has always existed: Conspiracy theorists view the mainstream media as an untrustworthy mouthpiece, spreading whatever information various government officials — regardless of their political party — want to spread, and often obscuring the truth.  Add to that many Americans’ current distrust of the media, and the growing belief that media organizations are spreading “fake news,” and it’s not really a surprise that conspiracy theorists and outlets that position themselves as truth-tellers have become more prominent.  We don’t know the intricacies about Vargas’s political beliefs. But based solely on his “Melania” tweets, it seems he’s less anti-Trump or anti-GOP than he is convinced that the government is lying. His “Melania” theory ultimately picked up so much steam online that the White House actually denied the Melania impostor story in a statement to CNN.  ""Once again, we find ourselves consumed with a ridiculous non-story when we could be talking about the work the first lady is doing on behalf of children, including the opioid crisis that is gripping our nation,"" East Wing communications director Stephanie Grisham told the network.  But as is the case with any good conspiracy theory, no official statement denying the plausibility will ever be enough.  Of course the White House is saying the idea of a fake Melania Trump is not a real story. You think they're going to admit it? — BuyLegalMeds.com (@JoeVargas) October 19, 2017  The “Melania” story is really about Melania Trump’s ongoing narrative as first lady  The idea of someone impersonating the first lady to fool the American people relies on the idea that the real first lady is off doing something else and abdicating her duties. This aligns with the narrative that is often applied to Melania Trump, especially by observers on the left.  Since Donald Trump was elected, people have subscribed to the belief that, at best, Melania Trump didn’t ever want to be first lady, and at worst openly loathes her husband. In a sense, it’s a different kind of conspiracy theory, one that someone could believe in while still scoffing at the idea that Melania employs a body double.  “Melania Trump hates holding her husband’s hand,” Huffpost reported earlier this year.  “What signal is Melania sending?” a CNN opinion piece asked in May, after news cameras caught what appeared to be Melania swatting away the president’s hand in Rome.  The Independent has interviewed etiquette experts about the couple’s body language and whether Donald Trump’s “walking distance” from Melania was “disrespectful.”  And there are multiple YouTube uploads that depict what some people feel is a fraying relationship, or imply that the Trumps’ marriage is on the rocks.  It all plays into a kind of benevolent sexism that’s often applied to women who are part of the Trump administration. The common narrative that currently surrounds many of the women in the administration, including Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump and his campaign communications guru-turned-counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway, suggests they should be held accountable for the decisions the president makes in the spheres that those women have spoken publicly about (e.g., Conway’s defenses of the president on television or Ivanka being held accountable for the president’s policies regarding women’s rights and health care).  But that wasn’t always the case.  Around the time of the election and for a few months after it, the women of Trump’s administration were often treated like voices of reason that he never listened to. Many a Saturday Night Live sketch painted Conway, Ivanka Trump, and Melania Trump as reluctant bystanders who involuntarily got dragged into something they wanted nothing to do with.  While that “reluctant bystander” assessment has fallen away from Ivanka Trump and Conway as Trump’s presidency continues, it has persisted for Melania.  The “Melania” theory is a natural extension of that: It paints Melania as either unwilling to be part of the administration or as someone who hates her husband so much that she’s found a body double to stand in as the first lady while she ostensibly does whatever else she’d rather be doing than representing the country.  If the Trump presidency ended today, a large part of Melania’s legacy as first lady would hinge on how lots of people believed that she didn’t want the job.  That leaves us with the question of what to make of a conspiracy theory like “Melania,” which further casts Melania Trump as America’s first damsel in distress. For some people, “Melania” is another reason never to trust anything the government says or does. For others, Melania’s imagined suffering is a testament to whatever they may think of the president. And though many people could stand to make more of an effort to recognize Melania’s agency and autonomy, subscribing to the idea of Melania’s body double defiance seems to be the preferred path, even though it says much more about us than Melania herself.",https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/10/20/16503870/fake-melania-conspiracy-theory-explained

It also occurs when students hear one perspective on a topic from one professor and a differing perspective from another. Debate occurs between students in the hallway between classes, in the student center, and in the library.

2404,Phani,,12,31,2099,YOU CAN’T MAKE THIS UP: Special Counsel Leading Trump-Russia Collusion Investigation Is Person Who Gave Russians Uranium Under Direction Of Crooked Hillary ,"You seriously can’t make this stuff up…  Wouldn’t it be great if we had a real and honest media, and this was the top story of the day today?  Trending: DIRTY POLITICS: LEAKED AUDIO Exposes Attempted Cover-Up Of Dem Leader’s Sponsorship Of Bussed In Protesters  Zero Hedge – Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton facilitated the transfer a highly enriched uranium (HEU) previously confiscated by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) during a 2006 “nuclear smuggling sting operation involving one Russian national and several Georgian accomplices,” a newly leaked classified cable shows.        *    Email *  Phone      So-called “background” information was provided in the cable which gave vague details on a 2006 nuclear smuggling sting operation in which the U.S. government took possession of some HEU previously owned by the Russians.  “Over two years ago Russia requested a ten-gram sample of highly enriched uranium (HEU) seized in early 2006 in Georgia during a nuclear smuggling sting operation involving one Russian national and several Georgian accomplices. The seized HEU was transferred to U.S. custody and is being held at a secure DOE facility.”  The secret “action request,” dated Aug. 17, 2009, was sent out by Secretary of State Clinton and was addressed to the United States Ambassador to Georgia Embassy Tbilisi, the Russian Embassy, and Ambassador John Beyrle.  It proposed that FBI Director Robert Mueller be the one that personally conducts the transfer a 10-gram sample of HEU to Russian law enforcement sources during a secret “plane-side” meeting on a “tarmac” in the early fall of 2009.  “We require that the transfer of this material be conducted at the airport, on the tarmac near by the plane, upon arrival of the Director’s aircraft.”  Gateway Pundit – The cable also states that “Given Russia’s reluctance to act so far, FBI Mueller’s delivery of this sample will underscore to Russia our commitment to follow through on this case.” It continues in stating, “Embassy Moscow is requested to alert at the highest appropriate level the Russian Federation that FBI Director Mueller plans to deliver the HEU sample once he arrives to Moscow on September 21.”  The cable summarizes that, “We regret that the April visit by Director Mueller could not take place due to a scheduling conflict.” and makes a final request that, “We require that the transfer of this material be conducted at the airport, on the tarmac near by the plane, upon arrival of the Director’s aircraft.”  Now knowing that the Obama Administration and Hillary Clinton hid the FBI investigation into the Uranium One deal, this cable brings on new meaning and leads to numerous questions.  Why did Obama and Clinton agree to provide this uranium delivered by Mueller to Russia in the first place?  An article by the Atlantic from April 2008 tells the fascinating story of the smuggler in the country of Georgia who was arrested trying to sell uranium to potential buyers. The smuggler, Oleg Vladimirovich Khintsagov, on January 31, 2006, was apprehended by authorities carrying 100 grams of highly enriched uranium tucked into a plastic bag in his tattered leather coat.  A sample of the uranium captured during this sting operation was provided to the Russians who analyzed it and determined that it was indeed highly enriched uranium (HEU). In the Atlantic article, it states that the Russians at first didn’t respond to requests from Georgia on the uranium and at no time asked for the uranium back. As a matter of fact, the Russians worked hard to deny that the uranium came from Russia in the first place. So why did the Obama Administration hand deliver 10 grams of HEU to Russia in 2009 and when did Russia begin asking for another sample of the uranium and why did the memo not mention that the Russians had already obtained a sample of this uranium and determined that it was HEU?  Another question is why did Clinton’s Secretary of State request that FBI Director Mueller deliver the sample of HEU to Russia and why was the transfer in April canceled and postponed to September?  Of all people, why would the Head of the FBI be selected to transfer uranium to Russia? It would seem that the US has a number of individuals who could perform this transfer and it would seem that FBI Director Mueller would have enough on his plate in the US. When Mueller couldn’t make the transfer in April the transfer was postponed to September so Mueller could be there.  The fact that Mueller needed to perform the transfer should raise numerous red flags. It’s been widely reported about Mueller’s conflicts of interest with his recent appointment as special counsel in the Russia investigation.  According to The Hill, before the Obama administration approved a controversial deal in 2010 giving Moscow control of a large swath of American uranium, the FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin’s atomic energy business inside the United States, according to government documents and interviews.  Federal agents used a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records, make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as 2009 that showed Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FBI and court documents show.  They also obtained an eyewitness account — backed by documents — indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton’s charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow, sources told The Hill.  The racketeering scheme was conducted “with the consent of higher level officials” in Russia who “shared the proceeds” from the kickbacks, one agent declared in an affidavit years later.  Rather than bring immediate charges in 2010, however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefitting Putin’s commercial nuclear ambitions.  Then-Attorney General Eric Holder was among the Obama administration officials joining Hillary Clinton on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States at the time the Uranium One deal was approved. Multiple current and former government officials told The Hill they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered.  Spokesmen for Holder and Clinton did not return calls seeking comment. The Justice Department also didn’t comment.  Mikerin was a director of Rosatom’s Tenex in Moscow since the early 2000s, where he oversaw Rosatom’s nuclear collaboration with the United States under the Megatons to Megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries. In 2010, Mikerin was dispatched to the U.S. on a work visa approved by the Obama administration to open Rosatom’s new American arm called Tenam.  Between 2009 and January 2012, Mikerin “did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire confederate and agree with other persons … to obstruct, delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity (enriched uranium) in commerce by extortion,” a November 2014 indictment stated.  His illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness, an American businessman, who began making kickback payments at Mikerin’s direction and with the permission of the FBI. The first kickback payment recorded by the FBI through its informant was dated Nov. 27, 2009, the records show. For entire story: The Hill  The investigation was ultimately supervised by then-U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein, an Obama appointee who now serves as President Trump’s deputy attorney general, and then-Assistant FBI Director Andrew McCabe, now the deputy FBI director under Trump, Justice Department documents show.  On August 6, 2017, The Washington Times questioned Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s “fishing expedition” aimed at digging up dirt on President Trump in his investigation in the Trump-Russia investigation.  “The special counsel is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Justice, and we don’t engage in fishing expeditions,” Mr. Rosenstein said on “Fox News Sunday.”  In his first Sunday show interview, Mr. Rosenstein added that special counsel Robert Mueller “understands and I understand the specific scope of the investigation and so, it’s not a fishing expedition.”  Mr. Rosenstein’s comments come amid reports citing unnamed sources that the investigation has expanded into Mr. Trump’s finances unrelated to possible Russian interference in last year’s election.  Mr. Rosenstein played down the reports: “That’s not anything that I’ve said. That’s not anything Director Mueller has said.

New York is investing $30 million in a 50-mile drone testing corridor between Rome and Syracuse for drone research and development. (AP Photo/Mary Esch)  ROME, N.Y. (AP) — Envisioning a day when millions of drones will buzz around delivering packages, watching crops or inspecting pipelines, a coalition is creating an airspace corridor in upstate New York where traffic management systems will be developed and unmanned aircraft can undergo safety and performance testing.  The unmanned aircraft traffic management corridor, jump-started by a $30 million state investment, will extend 50 miles (80 kilometers) west over mostly rural farmland from Griffiss International Airport, a former Air Force base in Rome that is already home to NASA-affiliated drone testing.  It will be equipped with radar and ground-based sensors to enable what Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo boasted would be “the most advanced drone testing in the country.”  The first segment of the corridor was launched last month by the Northeast UAS Airspace Integration Research Alliance, a coalition of private and public entities and academic institutions in New York and Massachusetts created to establish Griffiss as a drone industry incubator.  The airport is one of seven places around the country designated by the Federal Aviation Administration as an unmanned aircraft systems test site. Other sites are in Virginia, North Dakota, New Mexico, Texas, Nevada and Alaska.  Testing at the airport now is restricted to a five-mile radius, in part because of Federal Aviation Administration rules that normally limit flying beyond the operator’s line of sight, except in special circumstances, such as disaster area surveys. That keeps companies like Amazon and Walmart from using drones for package delivery.  Companies will be able to use the corridor to test hardware in airspace where manned aircraft also fly. Part of the concept is to help NASA to test technology that will allow the FAA to create regulations opening the national airspace to a commercial drone industry.  “Clients will eventually be able to fly beyond the visual line of sight in the corridor testing their technology,” said Tony Basile, NUAIR’s vice president for operations.  In addition to supporting development of drone air traffic control rules and systems, NUAIR helps unmanned aircraft service companies demonstrate their wares to clients and provides drone pilot training to state forest rangers, law enforcement and others.  “We’re evaluating aircraft today, but the ultimate goal is, how do we operate in a beyond-line-of-sight capability,” said Glen Davis, safety director of AIROS, a General Electric venture company that was at Griffiss this week to test a 6-foot-(1.8-meter) long unmanned helicopter for pipeline and refinery inspections.  New York officials expect the Griffiss drone research initiative to help lure tech companies to central New York, which has suffered economically with the decline of manufacturing.  Cuomo has pledged up to $250 million under his Upstate Revitalization Initiative to foster growth of the unmanned aerial vehicle industry.  A key player in that initiative is Syracuse-based Gryphon Sensors, which used $5 million in state funding to develop a van equipped with radar to spot drones up to six miles away. Gryphon developed ground-based sensors and radars that track aircraft at the NUAIR test site.  Like self-driving cars, unmanned aircraft will ultimately need onboard sensors allowing them to detect and avoid obstacles including other aircraft, Basile said.  “Once technology has gotten to that point, the sensor systems used in this corridor will be repurposed to give additional coverage around airports or other places,” he said.  Basile said it will take about a year to design the corridor, install sensor equipment and begin flight testing.",https://www.apnews.com//69b7409c2dc745adac871e609da20df4/New-York-advances-drone-industry-with-testing-corridor
2440,Phani,,12,31,2099,Niger attack leaves 4 US soldiers dead: What to know,"There were multiple things to blame for the October ambush in Niger that left multiple U.S. service members dead, including insufficient training and preparation as well as the team’s deliberate decision to go after a high-level Islamic State group insurgent without proper command approval, the Pentagon has said.  Four U.S. soldiers were killed in October 2017 by Islamic militants who attacked their convoy in Africa with rocket-propelled grenades and heavy machine guns. The body of one soldier was not found for two days.  The Pentagon’s report, released on May 10, took three months to complete, spokeswoman Dana White said in a statement. Defense Secretary James Mattis found “institutional and organizational issues, not isolated to this event that must be addressed immediately by the Department of Defense,” she said.  “However, no amount of investigation or corrective action will ease the agonizing grief that the families of our fallen must feel,” White said. “The Department hopes that the families will take pride and comfort in knowing – as this investigation makes clear — that their loved ones fought and died bravely in defense of our Nation, its people and the values we hold dear.”  From President Donald Trump’s calls to the families of the deceased to the White House’s delayed response to the ambush, details about the attack have drawn intense scrutiny and criticism. Read on for a look at what happened in Niger.  Who were the Americans killed?  Sgt. La David Johnson, 25; Staff Sgt. Bryan Black, 35; Staff Sgt. Jeremiah Johnson 39; and Staff Sgt. Dustin Wright, 29, were killed in the attack.  The bodies of some of the Americans killed were recovered by a U.S.-contracted helicopter, a U.S. official previously told . Sgt. Johnson's body wasn't found until two days after the attack as he and some Nigerien soldiers were separated from the others during the battle, the Pentagon said.  According to the report, the four killed “gave their last full measure of devotion to our country and died with honor while actively engaging the enemy.” It said none were captured alive by the enemy and all died immediately or quickly from their wounds.  What did the Pentagon say happened?  The Pentagon’s summary lays out a confusing chain of events that unfolded on Oct. 3-4, ending in a lengthy, brutal firefight as 46 U.S. and Nigerien forces battled for their lives against more than 100 enemy fighters. Amid the chaos, the report identified repeated acts of bravery as the outnumbered and outgunned soldiers risked their lives to protect and rescue each other during the more than hour-long assault.  Military officials found that the U.S. forces didn’t have time to train together before they deployed and did not do pre-mission battle drills with their Nigerien partners. And the report found that there was a lack of attention to detail and lax communication about missions that led to a “general lack of situational awareness and command oversight at every echelon.”  According to the report, the Army Special Forces team left their camp on Oct. 3 to go after an Islamic State leader who was suspected of involvement in the kidnapping of an American aid worker. But the team leader and his immediate supervisor submitted a different mission to the higher command, saying they were going out just to meet tribal leaders. That less-risky mission was approved, and when the team got to the location, the insurgent wasn’t there.  Senior commanders, unaware of the team’s earlier actions, then ordered the troops to serve as backup for a second team’s raid, also targeting the leader. That mission was aborted, however, when weather grounded the second team. The original group was then ordered to another location to collect intelligence on the insurgent, which they did without problems.  It was on their way back to the home base when they stopped for water at the village of Tongo Tongo, about 120 miles north of Niger’s capital. There, the group was ambushed by Islamic State-linked militants armed with rocket-propelled grenade launchers and small firearms.  The Pentagon said it could not conclude that the village “willingly (and without duress)” aided and supported the militants in the attack.  What else should you know?  The report included multiple recommendations to improve mission planning and approval procedures, re-evaluate equipment and weapons requirements and review training that U.S. commandos conduct with partner forces.  Mattis has directed Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, head of U.S. Africa Command, to take immediate steps to address shortfalls and has given senior leaders four months to complete a review and lay out a plan for additional changes.  Why were troops in Niger?  U.S. forces have been in Niger for more than 20 years and a joint special operations task force was created by the U.S. in 2008.  In 2011, U.S. and French forces set up a counterterrorism force in the country, led by the French, with 4,000 troops and 35,000 Nigerien troops. There were 800 U.S. troops in Niger and 6,000 U.S. troops within 53 countries in Africa, Gen. Joe Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said last year.  But the presence of American soldiers in Niger reignited a debate about the Authorization for Use of Military Force – a public law enacted after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. At issue is whether the law gives the president the authority to take action against all terrorist organizations, not just Al Qaeda and the Taliban.  What was the White House's response?  The White House has been widely criticized for its response to the attack – especially in the delay in acknowledging the ambush.  President Trump, too, was criticized for his public feud with a Democratic congresswoman and Sgt. La David Johnson’s widow. Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., accused Trump of making “insensitive” remarks to Myeshia Johnson.  Trump has denied Wilson’s allegations, but the mother of the deceased soldier has backed up Wilson’s claims.  White House chief of staff John Kelly said he was ""heartbroken"" that Wilson used the conversation she overheard to attack Trump. Kelly, whose Marine son died in Afghanistan, added that the president did the best he could in the situation.  Because of the White House’s response to the attack, it’s been called “the president’s Benghazi” by some Democrats, referencing the controversial attack in 2012 that left four American service members dead.

2522,Phani,,12,31,2099,"Electric buses are coming, and they’re going to help fix 4 big urban problems","There is a ton of hype around electric cars right now, for understandable reasons. Several snazzy new models have been released recently, range continues improving, and ambitious cities are pledging to get rid of gas and diesel cars altogether. It’s a heady time.  But here’s a little appreciated fact: Personal vehicles are probably the most challenging to electrify cost-effectively. (Dragging one or two passengers around over long distances in a 2-ton vehicle takes a lot of energy.) The case for electrification is actually stronger for other types of vehicles.  At the top of the list: buses! City transit buses are ideal candidates for electrification.  For one thing, the world is rapidly urbanizing and particulate pollution — especially from diesel, the fuel of choice for older buses — is increasingly seen as a health crisis. Old buses drive around the city all day, at low speeds, spewing diesel smoke directly into urbanites’ faces, leading to countless illnesses and early deaths. (Diesel smoke is a big contributor to the 6.5 million deaths a year caused by air pollution.)  Electrification would mean that buses emit virtually no air pollutants or greenhouse gases. (The power plants where their electricity is generated might still generate those pollutants, but even if it is powered by coal plants, an electric bus averages far less pollution per-mile than a diesel bus.) Urban air quality would notably and immediately improve.  As a fuel, electricity is far cheaper than diesel or natural gas, and given that buses are utilized four times as much as the average personal vehicle, those savings add up. And because EVs of all kinds are simpler and have fewer parts, maintenance costs are lower.  Finally, electric buses are also just a much, much nicer experience — lower to the ground, roomier (diesel engines take up lots of space), not choked with the smell of fuel, and quieter, indeed close to silent. It is difficult to quantify the impacts of noise pollution in urban areas, but, well, imagine a dense urban area without big diesel engines roaring to life every few seconds. It would be nice.  All of this has been true for decades, of course. People were talking about battery-electric buses (BEBs) at the turn of the century. What’s changed is that the technology has advanced in leaps and bounds (range and power have doubled in just the past few years), an actual EV industry/supply chain has been established, and charging infrastructure is spreading.  The cost differential is still daunting — a BEB still costs $200,000 to $300,000 more up front — but the cumulative advantages have grown to the point that dozens of cities are rushing to replace their fleets. The latest is New York City, which announced on April 25 it will convert its public bus system to an all-electric fleet by 2040, or sooner.  Let’s take a quick look at some recent developments.  Electric bus sales are growing briskly, but will they boom?  There aren’t many reports available to the public on the global bus market (plenty of paywalled reports, if you’ve got $6,500 burning a hole in your pocket). But we can extract the gist from various summaries and, uh, purloined copies.  Analysts seem to agree that for the next 10 years or so, sales of nondiesel buses will grow much faster than diesel, though by absolute numbers diesel will remain the dominant fuel, because diesel buses are growing from a much larger base.  For instance, Navigant Research recently issued a report looking the global market for medium- and heavy-duty buses and projected this for the next 10 years.  Over the next decade, they see the global bus market expanding from just over 800,000 to over a million. The share taken by diesel will decline from 58 to 51 percent. Hybrids and BEBs, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.9 percent, will go from 21 to 22 percent by 2027. (BEBs are a growing part of that segment, with sales growing 40 percent just over the past year.)  The analysts at Freedonia Group are a little more bullish, projecting hybrids and BEBs to hit 22 percent by 2021. P&S Market Research projects a CAGR of 3.5 percent. All analysts agree that growth of nondiesel buses will be fastest in the developing world, particularly China and India, where air pollution issues are worst.  In short, analysts are being conservative (as analysts are wont to do), projecting steady incremental growth based on current trends. If they’re right, BEBs will grow, but will remain a relatively marginal presence in the global bus fleet for the next decade.  Perhaps not surprisingly, Ryan Popple, the CEO of electric bus company Proterra, thinks those analysts are missing the boat (or, uh, the bus).  In a February 2017 podcast interview with The Energy Gang, Popple predicted that, in the US alone, BEBs will represent a third of all new transit sales by 2020, 50 percent by 2025, and 100 percent by 2030.  In other words, he thinks BEBs will hit an inflection point, growth will radically accelerate, and they will eat the urban transit market whole, in fairly short order.  Why is Popple so confident? It has to do with lifecycle costs.  Costs, broadly considered  A recent paper from researchers at Carnegie Mellon University set out to compare different bus options based on their total lifecycle costs, which means construction, fuel, maintenance, infrastructure, air pollution impacts — everything.  They found that BEBs are currently competitive, on a total lifecycle-cost basis, with liquid natural gas (LNG), compressed natural gas (CNG), and hybrid diesel buses. That means BEBs can plausibly compete with roughly 40 percent of the current bus market, without any subsidies.  But here’s the twist. It is typical, in the US, for local transit agencies to get a big chunk of their transit capital funding from the federal government (specifically, the Federal Transit Administration). So the researchers modeled what would happen from a city’s perspective if 80 percent of the upfront capital costs of their bus purchases were covered.  Here’s what they found — note that there are two columns for each type of bus, the left with 80 percent of capital covered, the right without.  Because capital costs are the biggest chunk of BEB lifecycle costs — remember, they cost $200,000 to $300,000 more than diesel buses up front — outside capital helps them the most. In fact, for cities with federal funding, it makes BEBs the lowest cost option. (Note that this would be true even without considering air pollution or climate benefits.)  This point is important and worth dwelling on a moment. It is a perpetual problem for clean energy technology that it costs more up front but saves more money over the long haul; purchasing decisions tend to be made by myopic agents biased against upfront costs. Most clean energy markets require tweaks and incentives to overcome this misalignment of incentives.  Municipal transit decisions in the US have a built-in counter-balance to that problem. Municipal officials, because they do not have to raise the full upfront capital, are freed to consider lifecycle costs. This makes municipal transit a huge potential market for EBs.  There’s still a great deal of bias toward the status quo, of course — any new technology has to overcome it. Cities know how to plan for and deal with liquid-fueled fleets. The needs of electric fleets are somewhat murky.  Luckily, the barriers to BEB adoption — the high upfront costs, the limited range, the unfamiliarity of charging infrastructure — are being rapidly overcome. Let’s take a brief look at how the market and technologies are evolving (faster than anyone predicted). As you’ll see, a snapshot of today’s costs scarcely does justice to the potential.  As BEB tech advances, the market grows and big players jostle for advantage  The bulk of the buzz in the BEB space is around California-based Proterra. It was founded way back in 2008, but in 2014, the midst of a slump, it hired CEO Ryan Popple away from Tesla to turn the company around and make it more, uh, Tesla-ish.  And that’s just what he’s done. Popple pulled some top talent from Tesla and, crucially, adopted Tesla’s strategy of focusing exclusively on EVs, designing them from the ground up rather than retrofitting existing vehicle designs. That has meant some bold choices, but it seems to be paying off — the company is growing, drawing new funding, and riding a huge wave of hype, straining to keep up with demand (like, uh, Tesla).  To date, Proterra has sold 400 BEBs to a variety of cities around the US, but it is rapidly ramping up manufacturing capacity, hoping to crank out 400 BEBs a year going forward.  Because it uses ultra-lightweight carbon fiber for the body rather than steel or aluminum, Proterra’s buses are thousands of pounds lighter than their competitors’. Combined with custom-designed batteries, its newest model is producing jaw-dropping results.  To wit: Last month, Proterra’s brand new, 40-foot Catalyst E2 Max traveled more than 1,000 miles on a single charge. (Yes, you read that right.)  That 1,101.2-mile drive set the new all-time world record for distance traveled by an electric vehicle — a record previously held by an experimental one-seater EV that was, according to the company, 46 times lighter.  The long, flat battery packs in the floor and ceiling hold between 440 and 660 kWh of energy (double the company’s previous bus), translating to a nominal range of between 200 and 350 miles, depending on the configuration. That is, needless to say, longer than most transit routes in America.  The bus boasts two electric motors, which give it 510 horsepower for acceleration (compared to a diesel bus’s 280) and allow it to tackle 26 percent grades, “more than twice the performance of the average 35- or 40-foot diesel bus, and 72 percent better than competing electric transit vehicles.”  In short, relative to diesel buses, Proterra’s new bus is quieter, accelerates faster, copes with hills better, smells better, has comparable range, and boasts radically lower fuel costs. Not bad.  Proterra is also licensing its drivetrain — it will be used by the EU’s Van Hool for its new line of BEBs — and has (like, ahem, Tesla) open-sourced its fast-charging technology, which can fully charge a bus in 10 minutes.  Proterra recently opened a new manufacturing facility outside LA, hoping to ramp production to keep up with demand.  It is far from alone, though, in this growing market. Earlier this month, Chinese automaker BYD, backed by billionaire financier Warren Buffet, unveiled a massive expansion of its manufacturing facility in Lancaster, California, more than quadrupling it to 450,000 square-feet. (It is powered entirely by renewable energy.) The facility will be cranking out not just buses, but electric trucks for various medium- and heavy-duty applications.  Volvo, a leader in the space, recently unveiled a schmancy new version of its 7900 series BEB. It gets 125 miles on a full charge, but, interestingly, Volvo is also offering wireless charging embedded in roads as part of a “total solution” for cities.  Hyundai recently unveiled a BEB (the “Elec City,” get it?) with 180-mile range. Volkswagen, still reeling from its diesel scandal, will invest $1.7 billion in developing electric (and eventually autonomous) trucks and buses. New Flyer, one of the world’s biggest transit companies, recently unveiled its new Xcelsior Charge BEB, with a 200-mile range. Tata Motors is going crazy with BEBs in India. And so on.  As these companies scale up, it creates more and more of an actual industry, a supply chain of parts and expertise that aspiring new companies can draw on. With scale and learning come falling costs.  Right now, BEBs are just barely on the cusp for many cities — a close and agonizing economic decision. But as battery costs continue to fall, economies of scale kick in, and simple urban envy goes to work, the market will expand rapidly, the business case will become clearer, and the trickle of cities will become a flood. It has already begun.  Here in #Winnipeg, touring the New Flyer bus factory floor. Electric buses made here are a great #CANClimateAction! #CleanTransportation pic.twitter.com/eNYMMDbYH3 — Minister C. McKenna (@ec_minister) October 13, 2016  Cities are going gaga for BEBs  In October, representatives from a dozen global cities signed the Fossil-Fuel-Free Streets Declaration, which pledges them to purchasing only zero-emissions buses (i.e., BEBs) starting in 2025. From North America, Vancouver, BC, Los Angeles, and Seattle signed.  Los Angeles has committed to transitioning its entire bus fleet (the nation’s second largest, which previously transitioned from diesel to CNG) to electricity by 2030. It recently ordered 60 new 40-foot BEBs from BYD and 35 new 60-foot, articulated BEBs from New Flyer, with an option to purchase 65 more after testing.  “We have two choices,” said Mayor Eric Garcetti in July. “We can wait for others, and follow, at the expense of residents’ health — or lead and innovate, and reduce emissions as quickly as possible. I’d much rather do the latter.”  King County Transit, which serves Seattle, recently announced a commitment to purchasing 120 BEBs by 2020, starting with 73 from Proterra (“more than 20 percent of Proterra’s entire sales since its inception,” notes Fred Lambert). Eight will go in service this year; 11 more next year.  But LA and Seattle are not alone. New York, which has the largest transit fleet in the country, is testing 10 all-electric buses and plans to purchase 60 more by 2019 and go all-electric by 2040, InsideClimate News reports. Washington, DC now has 14. Chicago has plans to buy 20 to 30 BEBs. Louisville, Kentucky has 15. Twin Cities’ Metro Transit is getting six this year. Park City, Utah, will get seven (in addition to the six it has). Portland, Oregon, will get five. Albuquerque, New Mexico, is ordering 18 60-foot, articulated BEBs from BYD. Up in Canada, Edmonton will buy only BEBs beginning in 2020, while Montreal will poke its toe in the water with three. And so on.  And that’s just North America, where BEBs are currently 1 percent of the fleet. In China, they’re already at 20 percent. If I tried to cover all the Asian and EU cities electrifying their bus fleets, this post would never end.  The future is BEB  The municipal transit market, while extremely large, is also fairly slow-moving. Buying buses is a big decision, transit planning tends to be a plodding process, and federal grants take forever.  Nonetheless, I’m with Popple. Contra Navigant et al, I don’t think this is going to be a matter of steady linear growth for the next 10 years. At some point, likely within the decade, the market will cross a threshold and start rocketing up the bottom of the “S curve” new technologies tend to follow. No analyst wants to predict exactly when that will happen — they’ll look dumb if they guess too early, but won’t look dumb if they’re too late like all the other analysts — but I don’t think it’s very far away.  BEBs are already tiptoeing around at the edge of penciling out for lots of cities. As the industry scales up, costs come down, and the benefits of BEBs become visible to the urban public, more and more cities will board the bandwagon. Eventually, the lifecycle-cost lines will cross decisively and there will be no coherent case for not going all electric.  My prediction: That virtuous cycle begins relatively soon and, as Popple says, by 2030, BEBs will be the default choice for new transit.  In 2030, no city official would dream of ordering a deafeningly loud, literally poisonous people-moving machine that depends on tens of thousands of gallons of imported liquid fossil fuel at fluctuating, unpredictable prices.

According to the Post:  Mark Elias, a lawyer representing the Clinton campaign and the DNC, retained Fusion GPS, a Washington firm, to conduct the research.  After that, Fusion GPS hired dossier author Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer with ties to the FBI and the U.S. intelligence community …  Before that agreement, Fusion GPS’s research into Trump was funded by a still unknown Republican client during the GOP primary.  So, who is that “still unknown Republican”? Could it be Senator John McCain, the petty and spiteful sworn emeny of Donald Trump? What about his admission in January 2017, that he was the one who passed along the dossier of claims of a Russian blackmail plot against the president-elect? McCain called it doing ‘what any citizen should do’. McCain – a longstanding anti-Trump Republican who had disassociated himself from the candidate’s campaign weeks before the election – cast himself as an innocent and concerned member of the public as he justified his move. He claimed he had no idea whether it was accurate or not – but that he believed the FBI should have it because it was ‘sensitive’. ‘I did what any citizen should do. I received sensitive information and handed it to the FBI,’ he told CNN – the network which broke the story that the document existed. It was then published in full by Buzzfeed. The Arizona senator issued a public statement amid mounting questions of his exact role in the affair – and how a document riddled with errors and unverifiable claims came to be published. ‘Late last year, I received sensitive information that has since been made public,‘ he said. ‘Upon examination of the contents, and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy, I delivered the information to the Director of the FBI.’ ‘That has been the extent of my contact with the FBI or any other government agency regarding this issue.’ But the 2008 Republican loser, who disowned his party’s candidate weeks before the election, may have been far more intimately involved than that. –Daily Mail  The Clinton campaign and the DNC, through the law firm, continued to fund Fusion GPS’s research through the end of October 2016, days before Election Day.

Until now, Fusion GPS has continued to refuse to cooperate with congressional panels investigating Russian attempts to intervene in the election, and how the Obama administration probed those efforts. Democrats have also protected the company.  The revelation that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee were involved in procuring the salacious accusations against Trump that fed their own later accusations of Russian interference in the election lends credence to those who, like Trump himself, have regarded the Russia accusations as conspiracy theories. – Breitbart",https://100percentfedup.com/wow-look-paid-russia-dossier-triggered-fbi-investigate-trump/

Citing FEC statements of policy that the “purpose of disbursement” section on campaign disclosure forms “must be sufficiently specific to make the purpose of the disbursement clear,” CLC is arguing these facts constitute a violation of federal election law.  By no means a right-leaning organization, the officially non-partisan CLC, has taken donations from left-wing activist billionaire George Soros, is still partly funded by a Soros family foundation, and lists opposing the effects of the Citizens United decision as part of its raison d’etre.  The group is most well-known in conservative circles for playing a leading role in urging Lois Lerner’s IRS to investigate Tea Party groups in 2010 and 2011. The CLC recently filed an IRS complaint against Alabama U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore’s religious foundation and hired a prominent Obama administration official as its senior ethics director.  Any citizen or group may make a complaint to the FEC, which, if it finds reason to believe the complaint raises serious likelihood of election law violations, begins its own investigation.  Perkins Cole attorney Marc Elias repeatedly lied to mainstream media reporters investigating the dossier, denying long-running rumors that Hillary Clinton and Democrats were behind the document then-FBI Director James Comey called “salacious and unverified.” The Washington Post confirmed those rumors were entirely true Tuesday in a bombshell report that further collapses the Trump-Russia collusion narrative.  In that narrative’s place, one of wrongdoing and perhaps collusion with Russian intelligence officials on the part of Democrats, Clinton campaign surrogates, and possibly, given reports of FBI payments to the dossier’s creator, elements of the Obama era Justice Department, is forming.

It also argues that noncompetes make it harder for state employers to find the best people, reducing innovation and limiting the pool of workers that thriving businesses need to grow.  “It’s clearly a winning issue for attorneys general,” said Alan B. Krueger, a Princeton economics professor who was chairman of Mr. Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers.  In Illinois and elsewhere, much of the recent interest among legislators and attorneys general began a little over three years ago, when the Huffington Post reported that the Jimmy John’s sandwich chain required hourly sandwich makers and delivery drivers to sign noncompetes. Illinois sued Jimmy John’s last year, arguing that its noncompete agreement violated the state’s consumer fraud act — the new noncompete law hadn’t been passed yet — and reached a settlement in which the company agreed to remove the clause.  New York’s attorney general announced a similar settlement with Jimmy John’s.  Each time the Jimmy John’s case was in the news, the Illinois attorney general’s office received a round of calls from workers who felt they had signed an unfair noncompete agreement, including nurses, sales representatives, day care workers and cooks.  One complaint came from an undisclosed employee of Check Into Cash. Ms. Madigan said her office was investigating about a dozen companies over the use of noncompete agreements.  According to the lawsuit, clerks at Illinois branches of Check Into Cash agree not to work at any employer offering services like check cashing, loans or money transmission for a year after they leave. It applies to employers within 15 miles of any of the company’s more than 1,000 locations in the United States.  The Illinois attorney general’s lawsuit said that because Check Into Cash had 33 locations in the state, its workers were effectively agreeing not to seek employment at competitors across Chicago and its suburbs.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/business/economy/illinois-noncompete.html
2587,Phani,,12,31,2099,"A simple guide to CRISPR, one of the biggest science stories of the decade","One of the biggest and most important science stories of the past few years will probably also be one of the biggest science stories of the next few years. So this is as good a time as any to get acquainted with the powerful new gene editing technology known as CRISPR.  If you haven’t heard of CRISPR yet, the short explanation goes like this: In the past six years, scientists have figured out how to exploit a quirk in the immune systems of bacteria to edit genes in other organisms — plants, mice, even humans. With CRISPR, they can now make these edits quickly and cheaply, in days rather than weeks or months. (The technology is often known as CRISPR/Cas9, but we’ll stick with CRISPR, pronounced “crisper.”)  Let that sink in. We’re talking about a powerful new tool to control which genes get expressed in plants, animals, and even humans; the ability to delete undesirable traits and, potentially, add desirable traits with more precision than ever before.  In 2017 alone, researchers reported in Nature that they’d successfully used CRISPR in human embryos to fix a mutation that causes a terrible heart muscle disorder called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. (Other researchers have since called some of the conclusions into question.) Another team used it to reduce the severity of genetic deafness in mice, suggesting it could one day be used to treat the same type of hearing loss in people.  Meanwhile, researchers at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard launched a coordinated blitz with two big studies that move CRISPR in that safer and more precise direction. A paper published in Science describes an entirely new CRISPR-based gene editing tool that targets RNA, DNA’s sister, allowing for transient changes to genetic material. In Nature, scientists published on a more refined type of CRISPR gene editing that can alter a single bit of DNA without cutting it — increasing the tool’s precision and efficiency.  And these are just a few of the astounding things researchers have recently shown CRISPR can do. We’ve already learned that it can help us create mushrooms that don’t brown easily and edit bone marrow cells in mice to treat sickle-cell anemia. Down the road, CRISPR might help us develop drought-tolerant crops and create powerful new antibiotics. CRISPR could one day even allow us to wipe out entire populations of malaria-spreading mosquitoes or resurrect once-extinct species like the passenger pigeon.  But there are real limits to what CRISPR can do, at least right now. Scientists have recently learned that the approach to gene editing can inadvertently wipe out and rearrange large swaths of DNA in ways that may imperil human health. That follows recent studies showing that CRISPR-edited cells can inadvertently trigger cancer.  As scientists work to overcome these limitations, much of the hype around CRISPR has focused on whether we might engineer humans with specific genetic traits (like heightened intelligence). But in some ways, that’s a sideshow. “Designer babies” are still far off, and there are enormous obstacles to making those sorts of complex genetic modifications. The stuff that’s closer at hand — from new therapies to fighting malaria — is what’s most exciting. So here’s a basic guide to what CRISPR is and what it can do.  What the heck is CRISPR, anyway?  If we want to understand CRISPR, we should go back to 1987, when Japanese scientists studying E. coli first came across some unusual repeating sequences in the bacteria’s DNA. “The biological significance of these sequences,” they wrote, “is unknown.” Over time, other researchers found similar clusters in the DNA of other bacteria (and archaea). They gave these sequences a name: Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats — or CRISPR.  Yet these CRISPR sequences were mostly a mystery until 2007, when food scientists studying the Streptococcus bacteria used to make yogurt showed how these odd clusters actually served a vital function: They’re part of the bacteria’s immune system.  See, bacteria are under constant assault from viruses and produce enzymes to fight off viral infections. Whenever the bacteria’s enzymes manage to kill off an invading virus, other little enzymes will come along, scoop up the remains of the virus’s genetic code, cut it into little bits, and then store it in those CRISPR spaces.  Now comes the clever part: The bacteria use the genetic information stored in these CRISPR spaces to fend off future attacks. When a new infection occurs, the bacteria produce special attack enzymes, known as Cas9, that carry around those stored bits of viral genetic code like a mug shot. When these Cas9 enzymes come across a virus, they see if the virus’s RNA matches what’s in the mug shot. If there’s a match, the Cas9 enzyme starts chopping up the virus’s DNA to neutralize the threat. It looks a little like this:  So that’s what CRISPR/Cas9 does. For a while, these discoveries weren’t of much interest to anyone except microbiologists — until a series of further breakthroughs occurred.  How did CRISPR revolutionize gene editing?  In 2011, Jennifer Doudna of the University of California Berkeley and Emmanuelle Charpentier of Umeå University in Sweden were puzzling over how the CRISPR/Cas9 system actually worked. How did the Cas9 enzyme match the RNA in the mug shots with that in the viruses? How did the enzymes know when to start chopping?  The scientists soon discovered they could “fool” the Cas9 protein by feeding it artificial RNA — a fake mug shot. When they did that, the enzyme would search for anything with that same code, not just viruses, and start chopping. In a landmark 2012 paper, Doudna, Charpentier, and Martin Jinek showed they could use this CRISPR/Cas9 system to cut up any genome at any place they wanted.  While the technique had only been demonstrated on molecules in test tubes at that point, the implications were breathtaking.  Further advances followed. Feng Zhang, a scientist at the Broad Institute in Boston, co-authored a paper in Science in February 2013 showing that CRISPR/Cas9 could be used to edit the genomes of cultured mouse cells or human cells. In the same issue of Science, Harvard’s George Church and his team showed how a different CRISPR technique could be used to edit human cells.  Since then, researchers have found that CRISPR/Cas9 is ridiculously versatile. Not only can scientists use CRISPR to “silence” genes by snipping them out, they can also harness repair enzymes to substitute desired genes into the “hole” left by the snippers (though this latter technique is trickier to pull off). So, for instance, scientists could tell the Cas9 enzyme to snip out a gene that causes Huntington’s disease and insert a “good” gene to replace it.  Gene editing itself isn’t new. Various techniques to knock out genes have been around for years. What makes CRISPR so revolutionary is that it’s incredibly precise: The Cas9 enzyme mostly goes wherever you tell it to. And it’s incredibly cheap and easy: In the past, it might have cost thousands of dollars and weeks or months of fiddling to alter a gene. Now it might cost just $75 and only take a few hours. And this technique has worked on every organism it’s been tried on.  This has become one of the hottest fields around. In 2011, there were fewer than 100 published papers on CRISPR. In 2017, there were more than 14,000 and counting, with new refinements to CRISPR, new techniques for manipulating genes, improvements in precision, and more. “This has become such a fast-moving field that I even have trouble keeping up now,” says Doudna. “We’re getting to the point where the efficiencies of gene editing are at levels that are clearly going to be useful therapeutically as well as a vast number of other applications.”  There’s been an intense legal battle over who exactly should get credit for this CRISPR technology — was Doudna’s 2012 paper the breakthrough, or was Zhang’s 2013 paper the key advance? Ultimately, a court ruled in February that the patent should go to Zhang and the Broad Institute, Harvard, and MIT. In the July, the University of California and others on Doudna’s side said they were launching an appeal of the decision. But the important thing is that CRISPR has arrived.  So what can we use CRISPR for?  So many things. Paul Knoepfler, an associate professor at UC Davis School of Medicine, told  that CRISPR makes him feel like a “kid in a candy store.”  At the most basic level, CRISPR can make it much easier for researchers to figure out what different genes in different organisms actually do — by, for instance, knocking out individual genes and seeing which traits are affected. This is important: While we’ve had a complete “map” of the human genome since 2003, we don’t really know what function all those genes serve. CRISPR can help speed up genome screening, and genetics research could advance massively as a result.  Researchers have also discovered there are numerous CRISPRs. So CRISPR is actually a pretty broad term. “It’s like the term ‘fruit’ — it describes a whole category,” said the Broad’s Zhang. When people talk about CRISPR, they are usually referring to the CRISPR/Cas9 system we’ve been talking about here. But in recent years, researchers like Zhang have found other types of CRISPR proteins that also work as gene editors. Cas13, for example, can edit DNA’s sister, RNA. “Cas9 and Cas13 are like apples and bananas,” Zhang added.  The real fun — and, potentially, the real risks — could come from using CRISPRs to edit various plants and animals. A recent paper in Nature Biotechnology by Rodolphe Barrangou and Doudna listed a flurry of potential future applications:  1) Edit crops to be more nutritious: Crop scientists are already looking to use CRISPR to edit the genes of various crops to make them tastier or more nutritious or better survivors of heat and stress. They could potentially use CRISPR to snip out the allergens in peanuts. Korean researchers are looking to see if CRISPR could help bananas survive a deadly fungal disease. Some scientists have shown that CRISPR can create hornless dairy cows — a huge advance for animal welfare.  Recently, major companies like Monsanto and DuPont have begun licensing CRISPR technology, hoping to develop valuable new crop varieties. While this technique won’t entirely replace traditional GMO techniques, which can transplant genes from one organism to another, CRISPR is a versatile new tool that can help identify genes associated with desired crop traits much more quickly. It could also allow scientists to insert desired traits into crops more precisely than traditional breeding, which is a much messier way of swapping in genes.  “With genome editing, we can absolutely do things we couldn’t do before,” says Pamela Ronald, a plant geneticist at the University of California Davis. That said, she cautions that it’s only one of many tools for crop modification out there — and successfully breeding new varieties could still take years of testing.  It’s also possible that these new tools could attract controversy. Foods that have had a few genes knocked out via CRISPR are currently regulated more lightly than traditional GMOs. Policymakers in Washington, DC, are currently debating whether it might make sense to rethink regulations here. This piece for Ensia by Maywa Montenegro delves into some of the debates CRISPR raises in agriculture.  2) New tools to stop genetic diseases: As the new Nature paper shows, scientists are now using CRISPR/Cas9 to edit the human genome and try to knock out genetic diseases like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. They’re also looking at using it on mutations that cause Huntington’s disease or cystic fibrosis, and are talking about trying it on the BRCA-1 and 2 mutations linked to breast and ovarian cancers. Scientists have even shown that CRISPR can knock HIV infections out of T cells.  So far, however, scientists have only tested this on cells in the lab. There are still a few hurdles to overcome before anyone starts clinical trials on actual humans. For example, the Cas9 enzymes can occasionally “misfire” and edit DNA in unexpected places, which in human cells might lead to cancer or even create new diseases. As geneticist Allan Bradley, of England’s Wellcome Sanger Institute, told STAT, CRISPR’s ability to wreak havoc on DNA has been “seriously underestimated.”  And while there have also been major advances in improving CRISPR precision and reducing these off-target effects, scientists are urging caution on human testing. There’s also plenty of work to be done on actually delivering the editing molecules to particular cells — a major challenge going forward.  3) Powerful new antibiotics and antivirals: One of the most frightening public health facts around is that we are running low on effective antibiotics as bacteria evolve resistance to them. Currently, it’s difficult and costly to develop fresh antibiotics for deadly infections. But CRISPR/Cas9 systems could, in theory, be developed to eradicate certain bacteria more precisely than ever (though, again, figuring out delivery mechanisms will be a challenge). Other researchers are working on CRISPR systems that target viruses such as HIV and herpes.  4) Gene drives that could alter entire species: Scientists have also demonstrated that CRISPR could be used, in theory, to modify not just a single organism but an entire species. It’s an unnerving concept called “gene drive.”  It works like this: Normally, whenever an organism like a fruit fly mates, there’s a 50-50 chance that it will pass on any given gene to its offspring. But using CRISPR, scientists can alter these odds so that there’s a nearly 100 percent chance that a particular gene gets passed on. Using this gene drive, scientists could ensure that an altered gene propagates throughout an entire population in short order:  By harnessing this technique, scientists could, say, genetically modify mosquitoes to only produce male offspring — and then use a gene drive to push that trait through an entire population. Over time, the population would go extinct. “Or you could just add a gene making them resistant to the malaria parasite, preventing its transmission to humans,” ’s Dylan Matthews explains in his story on CRISPR gene drives for malaria.  Suffice to say, there are also hurdles to overcome before this technology is rolled out en masse — and not necessarily the ones you’d expect. “The problem of malaria gene drives is rapidly becoming a problem of politics and governance more than it is a problem of biology,” Matthews writes. Regulators will need to figure out how to handle this technology, and ethicists will need to grapple with knotty questions about its fairness.  5) Creating “designer babies”: This is the one that gets the most attention. It’s not entirely far-fetched to think we might one day use CRISPR to edit the human genome — to eliminate disease, or to select for athleticism or superior intelligence.  That said, scientists aren’t even close to being able to do this. We’re not even close to the point where scientists could safely make the complex changes needed to, for instance, improve intelligence, in part because it involves so many genes. So don’t go dreaming of Gattaca just yet.  “I think the reality is we don’t understand enough yet about the human genome, how genes interact, which genes give rise to certain traits, in most cases, to enable editing for enhancement today,” Doudna said in 2015. Still, she added: “That’ll change over time.”  Wait, should we really create designer babies?  Given all the fraught issues associated with gene editing, many scientists are advocating a slow approach here. They are also trying to keep the conversation about this technology open and transparent, build public trust, and avoid some of the mistakes that were made with GMOs.  In February 2017, a report from the National Academy of Sciences said that clinical trials could be greenlit in the future “for serious conditions under stringent oversight.” But it also made clear that “genome editing for enhancement should not be allowed at this time.”  Society still needs to grapple with all the ethical considerations at play here. For example, if we edited a germline, future generations wouldn’t be able to opt out. Genetic changes might be difficult to undo. Even this stance has worried some researchers, like Francis Collins of the National Institutes of Health, who has said the US government will not fund any genomic editing of human embryos.  In the meantime, researchers in the US who can drum up their own funding, along with others in the UK, Sweden, and China, are moving forward with their own experiments.

2644,Phani,,12,31,2099,Trump’s wall won’t stop heroin from coming into the US,"President Donald Trump has advertised his idea for a “big, beautiful wall” at the US-Mexico border by arguing it will stop the flow of drugs into the US — a particularly timely goal as the US struggles with its worst drug overdose crisis ever in the opioid epidemic.  “An astonishing 90 percent of the heroin in America comes from south of the border, where we will be building a wall which will greatly help in this problem,” Trump said on Thursday as he announced that he’s declaring a public health emergency over the opioid crisis. “We’ll have a great impact.”  The wall’s heroin-fighting capabilities, however, could face a big nemesis: an ice cream truck.  It’s a scene out of TV shows like Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul: A truck transporting legal goods (like ice cream) goes through the US border, sneaking illicit drugs through security inspections by simply hiding them — whether among the other products, a secret compartment, or some other tricky spot.  Scenarios like this aren’t just the stuff of fiction; drug trafficking through a legal port of entry is how most illegal drugs make it into the US. And this kind of smuggling will be totally unaffected by a wall put in place to block illegal border crossings, showing that even the toughest border security measures may be next to worthless for dealing with illegal drugs.  To the extent that drugs do come through the areas a wall would cover, border security and drug policy experts say the wall will have little to no effect. That’s in part because traffickers are really good at figuring ways around obstacles — whether it’s launching drugs over the wall, carrying them under the wall, or sailing around it. But it’s also because if a wall did end up a big barrier, traffickers would probably just shift their operations to find other ways into the US.  “A wall alone cannot stop the flow of drugs into the United States,” Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center, told me. “If we’re talking about a broader increase in border security, there could be some — probably minor — implications for the overall numbers of drugs being trafficked. But history shows us that border enforcement has been much more effective at changing the when and where of drugs being brought into the United States rather than the overall amount of drugs being brought into the United States.”  All of that is to say that while Trump’s wall may be many things, there’s wide agreement among experts and in the empirical research that it won’t do much, if anything, to halt illegal drug trafficking. Drug trafficking organizations just have too much of a financial incentive — from the hundreds of billions they make in the illegal drug trade — to let a wall stand in their way, so they’ll come up with solutions, from ice cream trucks to submarines, to overcome any barriers to those profits.  Most drugs come through legal ports of entry  Among experts, there’s a consensus: Tougher border security measures, like a wall, don’t have much of an effect on drug trafficking. A 2013 report by journalist Reed Karaim summarized the general view, following years of border security buildups:  Most border security analysts say there is little evidence the buildup has significantly reduced the availability of illegal narcotics in the United States. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has cited reduced use of some drugs, especially cocaine, as proof the buildup is working. But other drugs have grown in popularity, and smugglers have proved adept at shifting their methods and locations in response to interdiction efforts.  One of the big problems is that these border security measures typically target the areas between legal ports of entry. But most drugs come through legal ports of entry.  It’s hard, given the nature of the black market, to draw up any hard numbers showing this, but the best data we have comes from the federal government. As the DEA concluded in 2015, drug traffickers “transport the bulk of their goods over the Southwest Border through ports of entry (POEs) using passenger vehicles or tractor trailers.” Wilson further clarified that while marijuana is often trafficked in the areas between official crossing points (which a wall would cover), harder drugs like cocaine, meth, and heroin mostly come to the US through the legal ports of entry.  “If the goal of border security policy is to cut into drug trafficking, the investments would be better made at the ports of entry,” Wilson said. Indeed, some of that work has happened in the past few years — with more personnel, drug-sniffing dogs, X-rays, better electronic records, and other technologies that can help catch drug traffickers.  But this isn’t a big part of the conversation about drug trafficking and border security in the US. In fact, Trump’s budget blueprint didn’t even mention the offices that deal with security at legal ports of entry: US Customs and Border Protection and its Office of Field Operations. Instead, the blueprint focused on the wall and unauthorized immigration. That doesn’t mean there won’t be a greater investment in security at legal ports of entry, but it does seem like this type of security isn’t a big priority, at least rhetorically, for the Trump administration — or in the public dialogue about drugs and border security.  The reality, though, is that even if the US did significantly increase security at legal ports of entry, it simply can’t catch all the drugs going through the border — at least without significantly damaging the economy by slowing down a massive point of trade between two neighboring allies.  “It’s a needle-in-a-haystack kind of a problem,” Wilson said. “The vast majority of crossings at ports of entry are people going about their day-to-day business [and] doing things that are totally legal and legitimate, whether going to work or school or shopping or trucking goods back and forth across the US-Mexico border.”  “We’re talking about a million licit crossings every day of people at the official crossing point,” Wilson added. “We’re talking about a million dollars of commerce between the United States and Mexico every minute. It’s just a huge amount of traffic — licit traffic — moving across the border.”  This is exactly why many drug traffickers resort to legal ports of entry: When there’s so much legal traffic to hide within, it’s safer and more reliable to go through a legal port of entry than to try a perilous journey through a desert or river patrolled by guards.  Drug traffickers have come up with all sorts of ways to overcome a wall  Some drugs do, however, make it through the areas between legal ports of entry. Could a wall stop those drugs from flowing into the US?  Experts, again, generally argue that it would not. What tighter border security, like a wall, by and large changes is how traffickers get drugs into the US rather than whether they do.  A wall, then, might get traffickers to rely more on legal ports of entry. Others may adapt new tactics and tools to get around tougher border security measures. But it won’t get them to stop trafficking altogether.  “An increase in border security could lead to greater use of technology,” Wilson said, “whether that’s a catapult, ultralight, or tunnel technology.”  This isn’t hypothetical. Over the past several decades, drug traffickers have come up with all sorts of ingenious ways to bypass border security. Here are a few examples, which, while not all very common, show the ridiculous lengths criminals are willing to go to get drugs in the US:  Tunnels: These burrow under the US-Mexico border — including the fencing that exists already — to create a vast network of underground drug smuggling. According to the Los Angeles Times, drug cartels have dug up dozens of these kinds of tunnels over the past decade — and they have continued successfully using some of the tunnels even after US and Mexican law enforcement officials discovered them. Drones: Drug cartels have made increasing use of drones over the past few years. In 2015, US officials caught a drone allegedly carrying 28 pounds of heroin, which federal prosecutors described as “the first international narcotics seizure by U.S. law enforcement involving the use of drones by Mexican drug traffickers.” It’s now to the point that the US Border Patrol reportedly flies a blimp with low-altitude radar to catch the drones in action. Submarines: Both submersibles and semi-submersibles have been used to send drugs from South America to the US, largely from Colombia to Mexico. These vehicles often are homemade, but they can be extremely sophisticated. Jay Bergman, head of the DEA’s Andean division, told Time magazine that the submarines in particular were “a quantum leap of technology” from the semi-submersibles, describing the new subs as “the difference between building a motor-scooter and building a car.” Bazookas: In a particularly ridiculous example, Mexican officials discovered a cannon — which they called a “homemade bazooka” — that might have been used to fling drugs across the border. US authorities have reported similar contraptions since at least 2012 with the ability to launch cans of drugs hundreds of meters from the border. Narco-torpedoes: One of the most advanced tools that drug traffickers have used are narco-torpedoes. These go deep underwater, but they’re attached to boats with cables — making them practically undetectable from above the water. If a trafficking boat is ever caught or inspected, it can simply detach the cable, let the narco-torpedo float to the bottom of the ocean, and send someone else to pick it back up with the help of a homing device attached to the torpedo. And since the narco-torpedo is so deep underwater, typical detection methods won’t see it coming.  Some of these methods can sound downright ridiculous. But they show that traffickers are very good at coming up with all sorts of ways to get around security.  In this way, the war on drugs has made traffickers even better at what they do. As Sanho Tree, a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies who focuses on the war on drugs, told me, “So we go after shrimp boats and fishing boats [used to smuggle drugs] and stop those, and they respond with cigarette boats. We respond with faster boats and helicopters to take out those boats, and then they switch to submersibles. And then we get better at detecting those with spotting towers now, and they go the fully submersible route. And if we do catch those, there are ‘narco-torpedoes’ now; these can be bolted under the hull of a ship with release cables and homing devices.”  There’s one downside for drug traffickers: The arms race could make drugs more expensive. Building a submarine, after all, is not cheap, and that higher price could make drugs less accessible to drug users.  But to the extent that that’s true, the arms race doesn’t seem to have had much of an impact on drug prices even as the US has escalated its war on drugs: Since the 1980s, the price of heroin has plummeted by nearly 86 percent, according to federal data. As Trump has acknowledged, a dose of heroin can now cost less than a candy bar.  Still, it’s safe to assume that these measures make illicit drugs more expensive than they otherwise would be.  Even that, however, can create problems through what’s known as the “profit paradox”: While a drug’s prohibition and interdiction make it more expensive, the higher price also makes drugs more lucrative to criminal groups. It’s one reason drugs that cost literally pennies can turn into a hundred- or thousand-dollar commodity. Those massive profits give drug traffickers more reason to seek out ways, including some expensive methods, to continue trafficking drugs in the face of international and governmental resistance. So the cycle continues.  Even if a wall does slow drug trafficking from Mexico, the drugs will flow from somewhere else  Imagine, however, that the US manages to make drug smuggling through the Mexico border so difficult that traffickers eventually decide it’s not worth it anymore.  If that were to happen, chances are criminal groups wouldn’t just quit the business for good. They would likely shift their operations and trafficking routes to other parts of the world.  This, again, is not a hypothetical. As governments cracked down on cocaine production in Peru and Bolivia in the 1990s, cartels shifted to Colombia. As governments cracked down on the Netherland Antilles, traffickers went through West Africa. And as the US cracked down on trafficking in the Caribbean, drug producers and traffickers went to Mexico — which is why we’re now talking about Mexico to begin with.  It’s what’s called the “balloon effect”: As one part of a balloon is pushed down, the air is simply shifted to other parts of the balloon. This could happen should tough border security measures make the US-Mexico border too much of a hurdle for traffickers.  “Enforcement along the US-Mexico border could, potentially, push things back to the Caribbean or to some other routes, whether it pushes people to smuggle more drugs on flights into the United States [or] open a new route in the Pacific,” Wilson said. “We don’t know, but one of the things we’ve seen over time is that there’s been a balloon effect.”  All of this shows why focusing so much on the law enforcement and interdiction side of the war on drugs just doesn’t work — and didn’t prevent the opioid epidemic, the worst drug overdose crisis in US history. That’s why Wilson and other experts are calling on the US to put more toward reducing demand for drugs — through prevention and drug treatment programs — instead of focusing so much on supply.  “That doesn’t mean that interdiction can’t play a role in a more comprehensive, better strategy,” Wilson said. “It just means that what we’ve done so far is not enough.”  As nice as Trump’s wall might sound to him and his supporters, then, it’s just not the right answer to America’s massive drug crisis.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/4/19/15326286/trump-wall-opioid-epidemic
2710,Phani,,12,31,2099,Apple Co-Founder Steve Wozniak Criticizes ‘Hype’ for Elon Musk’s Tesla,"Steve Wozniak is not quite as enamored with Elon Musk’s company Tesla as the rest of the tech world.  Speaking to CNBC’s Deirdre Bosa at the Money 20/20 conference in Las Vegas on October 22, the Wozniak asserted that there is “way too much hype” surrounding Musk’s Tesla company, particularyl its development of self-driving technology.  Wozniak fears that the public’s confidence in the charismatic visionary may translate to negligence behind the wheel as Tesla’s artificially intelligent vehicles continue to soar in popularity. “Tesla has in people’s mind that they have cars that will just drive themselves totally, and it is so far from the truth, so they have deceived us,” he said. “Sometimes Teslas are dangerous because of what they call ‘autopilot.’ You get thinking, ‘Oh, it is easy, I can reach over and not look for a few seconds,’ and that is the second your car drifts over the line.”  For now, Tesla autopilot remains limited. However, their capabilities continue to evolve every day. Even so, Wozniak remains unimpressed by the car’s navigational abilities: “Driving my Tesla, over and over and over there are unusual situations on any road anywhere and every single human being alive — dumb or smart — would be able to get through it and the Tesla can’t.”  The self-driving technology that divided Tesla’s own engineers still refuses to bill itself as a complete self-driving solution. The company has stated that while self-driving technology has proven to be safer thus far than vehicles under the control of humans, “we will [continue] to be extremely clear with current and potential customers that Autopilot is not a fully self-driving technology and drivers need to remain attentive at all times.”  Despite his lack of total confidence, Wozniak still believes that the company is on the right track overall for shifting the conversation away from fossil fueled vehicles and toward clean energy: “Tesla has done something that is so important to me.

If the candy is not in your home, your office, or your school, it’s in a bowl at the dry cleaner's, the doctor’s office, even the yoga studio.  We’ve officially entered the long season of candy-centric holidays. After we drench ourselves in sugar this Halloween, we'll do it again on Christmas and Hanukkah, Valentine’s Day, Passover, Easter, and in the weeks between these special days. The candy industry counts on us to celebrate with sugar for a huge portion of its annual sales.  We can all agree that Halloween and other seasonal candy is a fun ritual. I like chocolate as much as my  colleagues who recently ranked their favorite Halloween candies. And a bit of candy here and there is no problem for our health.  But we’ve reached a point where the amount of candy in circulation is excessive — and symbolic of our sugarcoated environment. In 2018, the candy industry expects Halloween will bring in $9 billion in retail sales.  Unlike the soda industry, which has taken a hit on its sugary products as consumers have gotten more health-savvy, the candy industry is doing better than ever. Overall, Halloween week now accounts for about 8 percent of yearly confectionery sales and 34 percent of seasonal candy sales (including those other candy holidays, like Christmas and Valentine’s Day), according to the National Confectioners Association. Only Easter, the next-largest candy holiday, comes close to October 31.  If you took all the candy that’s sold during Halloween week and turned it into a giant ball, like the one looming over the nation’s capital below, it’d be as large as six Titanics and weigh 300,000 tons:  That's 2 pounds of candy per American. With this kind of volume, and everyone buying candy and handing it out, it’s hard to control how much we — and our children — eat.  How big candy took over Halloween  Candy and Halloween didn't always go hand in hand. It wasn't until the 1950s that confectioners started to push their product this time of year as a way to boost flagging fall sales.  Candy was ideal for trick-or-treating, as convenient to hand out and carry around as it was affordable. Over the years, as the popularity of these treats increased, candy has also gotten cheaper, making it much more accessible to all. As the New York Times explains, ""Milky Way, Snickers and 3 Musketeers bars were 59 cents a pound [in 1964], or $4.53 in today's money."" Today, you can buy a pound of Halloween chocolates from Walmart for less than $3.  Beyond price, ubiquity, and tradition, there are other reasons we're hooked. Companies like Mars, Hershey, and Nestlé engineer their products to become irresistible and habit-forming, and spend billions overwhelming us with ads to entice to eat more and more.  A UConn Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity report found that in 2014, food companies spent $1.28 billion to advertise snack foods (including candy) on television, in magazines, in coupons, and, increasingly, on the internet and mobile devices. Almost 60 percent of that advertising spending promoted sweet and savory snacks, while just 11 percent promoted fruit and nut snacks.  It might be time to say no to so much candy  We know that our environments have a huge impact on the health choices we make, and the holiday candy deluge is another example of how sugary the food environment has become. Back in 1977, the average adult got 228 calories per day from sugar in food and drinks. By 2010, it was up to 300 calories a day. Added sugar consumption has increased 20 percent among kids.  Because sugar is so omnipresent now — not just during our holidays but throughout the year — health experts consider it a public health hazard, linked to obesity, tooth decay, and diabetes. Junk food more broadly is now being called a human rights concern.  So don’t be afraid to reject Halloween candy — or just throw some of it away. The heads of food banks are doing it, and so are dentists. It's hardly a treat anymore.",https://www.vox.com/2016/10/29/13408370/halloween-candy-market-obesity
2719,Phani,,12,31,2099,Why small talk is so excruciating,"I hate small talk. Hate it.  And when I say I hate it, what I really mean is I'm abysmal at it. Just a total failure.  Here's how I experience small talk. Say I find myself interacting with a sales clerk, meeting someone at a party or conference, bumping into a neighbor on the street, any situation that calls for chitchat. The minute the interaction begins, something inside me — I'd call it a ""thought,"" but it's deeper than that, physical almost — wants to get out of it. My fight-or-flight instincts kick in. It's like the somatic equivalent of white noise, louder and louder the longer the interaction goes on. It doesn't take long before it's deafening and I break it off, often in less-than-smooth ways.  The weird thing is, it's not that I have some general aversion to talking to people. I love talking to people! Anyone who has ever gotten drunk with me can attest to that. And I don't have generalized social anxiety. I'm perfectly comfortable in a group situation, or speaking before a crowd, both of which terrify many people. It's not people in general, or social situations in general, but specifically one-on-one small talk that is the issue.  The problem, of course, is that small talk precedes big talk in the normal course of human affairs. Most people feel the need to get comfortable with one another before they jump into the deep end of serious conversation or ongoing friendship. Which means if you hate and avoid small talk, you are also, as a practical matter, cutting yourself off from lots of meaningful social interaction, which is a bummer. Also, research shows that more frequent small talk, even among those who identify as introverts, makes people happier. Also, despite recent advances in technology, small talk remains an unavoidable part of many basic life tasks.  So it would be nice to be better at small talk, or at least to understand why I'm so horrible at it. Let's take a quick look at the research.  Researchers realize that small talk is no small thing  For all its ubiquity, small talk hasn't come in for a ton of academic study. The first theoretical account is generally traced to anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski, in his 1923 essay ""The Problem of Meaning in Primitive Languages."" He noted that a great deal of talk ""does not serve any purpose of communicating ideas"" but instead ""serves to establish bonds of personal union."" Malinowski termed the exchange of such talk ""phatic communion"" (""phatic"" from the Greek phatos, for ""spoken""). It is speech as social bonding rather than communication.  Malinowski obviously thought of this as a lesser form of speech, describing it as ""purposeless expressions of preference or aversions, accounts of irrelevant happenings, [and] comments on what is perfectly obvious."" (Sounds like Twitter!)  Often, he said, it was merely a way to fill silence.  ... to a natural man, another man's silence is not a reassuring factor, but, on the contrary, something alarming and dangerous. ... The modern English expression, 'Nice day today' or the Melanesian phrase, 'Whence comest thou?' are needed to get over the strange and unpleasant tension which men feel when facing each other in silence.  For decades thereafter, small talk retained its reputation as the lowest form of speech, mere space filler to ward off silence, little worthy of respect or serious study.  In the 1970s, however, sociolinguistics became more attuned to the everyday forms of speech that, after all, constitute the bulk of our verbal communication. And feminist sociolinguistics in particular noted that a dismissive attitude toward speech that establishes and maintains relationships — as opposed to task-oriented or informational speech — was of a piece with patriarchal disrespect for traditionally female roles. Think of the derogatory implications of the term ""gossip,"" which is, after all, social talk about social dynamics.  But the implications of the feminist critique go beyond that. In her introduction to a 2010 collection of academic essays on small talk, scholar Justine Coupland writes:  What primarily emerges from feminist critiques is the fact that western societies have whole-heartedly accepted that communication is in fact value-gradable, on a scale from most-to-least authentic, or most-to-least valid. ... Whether or not ""real talk"" has been held to be a man's exclusive domain is, from this perspective, less significant than the fact that an evaluative public conception of communication itself is strongly in place. Real talk is talk that ""gets stuff done,"" where ""stuff"" does not include ""relational stuff.""  In modern sociolinguistics, there's been a great deal of scholarly exploration of ""social language"" and the many situations in which small talk plays an important binding role.  Malinowski was wrong — small talk is not just important for those seeking companionship (or avoiding silence). It's also important in a whole range of social, commercial, and professional settings. It weaves and reweaves the social fabric, enacting and reinforcing social roles. Think of the different varieties of small talk between doctor and patient, vendor and customer, employer and employee. Each has its own rhythms and rules. And of course the character of small talk differs from place to place, culture to culture. For example, silence, contra Malinowski, is not viewed as threatening or uncomfortable in all cultures.  Speech says things, but it also does things  We need not get too far in the weeds. At a general level, it's simply important to remember that every speech act operates on two levels. On one level, it communicates information or ideas. This is the semantic content of the speech, i.e., what the words mean.  On another level, talking is a social behavior. Every speech act is an act, meant not only to communicate something but to do something: reassure, acknowledge, nurture, enjoin, reject, dominate, encourage, or just fill awkward silence. We can think of this as the social function of a speech act. Unlike semantic content, social function cannot be understood in isolation, just by examining the words. Social function depends entirely on context, on tone and body language, on the interpersonal roles being played, on historical and environmental cues. It only makes sense relative to context.  All speech acts operate on both levels, but the ratio of social function to semantic content differs along a continuum. In some circumstances, speech acts take on an almost entirely communicative role: a surgeon narrating her surgery; a surveillance pilot describing troop movements; a university lecturer describing an episode of history.  But cases of purely communicative speech are more the exception than the rule, found in specialized professional or academic settings. As sociolinguists have come to appreciate, in day-to-day human interaction speech is a social, relational behavior. That's why everyday patterns and rituals of speech are worthy of study; they reveal the social fabric.  Small talk falls on the other end of the continuum; it is speech that prioritizes social function. Think of this exchange: ""How's it going?"" ""Oh, pretty good."" There's not zero semantic content in there — presumably ""pretty good"" excludes ""dying at this exact moment,"" so that's some information. But the primary function of those speech acts is social, not to say something but to do something, i.e., make contact, reaffirm shared membership in a common tribe (whatever it may be), express positive feelings (and thus lack of threat), show concern, and so forth. These are not unimportant things, not ""small"" at all, really, but they are different from communicating semantic content.  Small talk — particularly in its purest form, phatic communion — is a context in which language has an almost ritualistic quality. The communication of ideas or information is secondary, almost incidental; the speech is mainly meant to serve the purpose of social bonding. It asks and answers familiar questions, dwells of topics of reliable comity, and stresses fellow feeling rather than sources of disagreement.  This helps explain the ubiquity of sports in small talk, especially male small talk. Sporting events are a simulation of conflict with no serious consequences, yet they generate enormous amounts of specific information. They are a content generator for small talk, easing the work of communion.  To ""talk well"" in the social sense, to be adept at sending the correct social signals, is a different skill than ""talking well"" in the communicative sense. And the two skills do not always go together. Everyone knows someone extremely verbal and eloquent but socially inept, or someone intuitively at ease in almost every social situation but inarticulate beyond that.  And then everybody knows that rare person who has seemingly mastered both, who can send all the right social signals while producing speech that also has interesting semantic content. I am not one of those people; watching them operate is, for me, like watching a magic show.  I know what I'm saying, but not what I'm doing  I am far more comfortable with the communicative role of language than the social role. And over the course of my life, my choices have reinforced that skills mismatch. I read more than I talk to people. I write more than I talk to people. I generally avoid small talk whenever possible. It's like exercising one set of muscles and not another; when it comes to language, I have massive upper-body strength and puny, spindly legs (er, metaphorically speaking).  Also, it should be noted, privileged white males have the luxury of remaining ignorant of subtle social signals; less-privileged groups live and die by them. Small talk is not so small to them.  Anyway, small talk engages the muscles and habits I have least developed. The functions of language I understand are backgrounded while the functions I don't understand are foregrounded. The criteria by which one chooses what to say shift from ""what's true; what's most interesting"" to ""what lubricates the exchange; what sets people at ease."" In effect, it's like trying to speak a foreign language — confoundingly, a foreign language that uses the same words my language uses, as though I'm using a familiar tool for an unfamiliar task.  When I meet someone, I'm trying to a) maintain eye contact, which feels like holding an exposed wire with low-level current running through it, and b) think of things to say that convey the correct social signals, even though I'm not certain what the correct social signals are, while c) ensuring that none of the things I say bring up any emotionally fraught or controversial topics, even though those are the topics I care most about, and d) concealing the fact that the inside of my head is a haze of white noise and I desperately want to escape the interaction. It's like patting your head while rubbing your belly ... while tap dancing and reciting the alphabet backward.  Those of you who do it fluidly, without even thinking about it, should pause for a moment of gratitude. It is an important skill, one that many people lack and are never taught. And if you ever meet me out on the street, just go ahead and ask me about politics or religion or the meaning of life — anything but sports or the weather. We'll get along famously.

2724,Phani,,12,31,2099,NEW STUDY Shows Why Atheists and People Who Agree With Immigrants That Bash Their Country Use LESS BRAIN POWER ,"It’s not at all surprising that at least 28% of Democrats consider themselves to be atheists. Fascinating…  This has to be embarrassing . . . if you’re an atheist. A new study performed at the University of York used targeted magnetism to shut down part of the brain. The result: belief in God disappeared among more than 30 percent of participants.    That in itself may not seem so embarrassing, but consider that the specific part of the brain they frazzled was the posterior medial frontal cortex—the part associated with detecting and solving problems, i.e., reasoning and logic.        *          In other words, when you shut down the part of the brain most associated with logic and reasoning, greater levels of atheism result.  You’ve heard the phrase, “I don’t have enough faith to be an atheist”? Apparently, we can now also say, “I have too many brains to be an atheist.” –The American Vision  Daily Mail – The study was carried out by Dr Keise Izuma from the University of York and Colin Holbrook from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). They recruited 38 participants with an average age of 21, to take part in the study. Each of these participants said they held significant religious beliefs, and the majority held moderate to extremely conservative political beliefs. Political views were important because it suggested they were more likely to have stronger viewpoints on immigration. Half of these participants formed part of a control group and received a low-level ‘sham’ procedure that did not affect their brains. The other half received enough energy through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to lower activity in the posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC). This part of the brain, located near the surface and roughly a few inches up from the forehead, is associated with detecting problems and triggering responses that address them. Following the treatment, all the participants were first asked to think about death before being asked questions about their religious beliefs and their feelings about immigrants. The death task including writing brief responses on the subject of their own death. To address their levels of prejudice, participants were asked to read two essays – one critical and one positive – written by an immigrant from Latin America about the US. After reading each essay, participants rated how much they liked the person who wrote the essay and how much they agreed with their views. Religious belief was measured using a version of the Supernatural Belief Scale. Items were presented in random order and rated according to the same scale used in the immigrant ratings. Questions included: ‘There exists an all-powerful, all-knowing, loving God’, ‘There exist good personal spiritual beings, whom we might call angels’ and ‘There exists an evil personal spiritual being, whom we might call the Devil.’ The findings, published in the journal Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, reveal that people whose brains were targeted by TMS reported 32.8 per cent less belief in God, angels, or heaven. They were also 28.5 per cent more positive in their feelings toward an immigrant who criticised their country. Circa – So how do Democrats and Republicans stack up when it comes to having faith vs. athesists? According to the Pew Research Center, “nones” — people who don’t identify with any religion — make up 23 percent of American adults. In the Democratic Party, that number is even bigger. 28 percent of Democrats are non-religious, Pew’s research shows. Conversely, people who identify as non-religious are much more likely to vote Democratic. 70 percent of self-identifying atheists, for example, voted for President Obama in 2012, according to Pew. One of those atheists is James White, a Texas delegate for Hillary Clinton at this year’s DNC. At the convention on Monday, White was wearing a shirt that read, “I’m actually an atheist.” White said he still feels it’s necessary to publicly broadcast his beliefs to promote acceptance of atheism within the party. “When we make it safe for people to realize that a nearly 60-year-old Texas middle-aged white guy is an atheist and a Democrat, those things make it easier for others to come forward too,” he said. There has been some progress, White said. Earlier this year, the Texas Democratic Party adopted three secular resolutions into its official policy platform.  The investigators additionally found that the magnetic stimulation had the greatest effect on reactions to the critical author in the essay test.",https://100percentfedup.com/new-study-shows-atheists-people-agree-immigrants-bash-country-use-less-brain-power/

2800,Phani,,12,31,2099,Lindsey Graham: There 'will be holy hell to pay' if Trump fires Mueller,"Special counsel Robert Mueller’s charges against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and two other aides mark a new phase in his sprawling investigation into Russia and President Donald Trump. But the president’s supporters on Capitol Hill have said they want all the facts to come in first.  There “will be holy hell to pay” if Mueller is dismissed, Senator Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told  on Monday, unconcerned about rumblings of the ongoing threat Mueller poses to the president. He said there is zero evidence from the White House that Mueller’s investigation will be stopped or curtailed.  Asked to elaborate, Graham continued: “I've heard nothing from the White House to suggest that the president's going to try to replace Mr. Mueller. Zero evidence from anybody I've talked to. It would be wrong to do so unless there were cause.”  People familiar with Trump’s thinking told The Associated Press the president has become increasingly concerned that the Mueller probe could be moving to an investigation into his personal dealings.  “No politician should ever be afraid of the American legal system working its will,” Graham told  about many of his colleagues’ refusal to comment on the case.  White House officials were publicly optimistic about Mueller’s investigation wrapping up swiftly.  Many lawmakers noted the U.S. government would continue as normal regardless of the indictments.  The agenda of the Trump administration such as health care and tax reform shouldn’t be affected, said Senator John N. Kennedy, R-La., noting that Americans can multitask. “Most Americans do, and I don’t see why we can’t,” he told .  Trump immediately sought to distance himself after Manafort and Rick Gates pleaded not guilty to a 12-count indictment alleging money laundering, conspiracy and other offenses.

2827,Phani,,12,31,2099,New York Times: Colleges Should Embrace Intellectual Diversity,"New York Times columnist Frank Bruni argued that universities need to do a better job of embracing Trump-minded students, in a column that was published on Saturday.  According to a survey by the education website Inside Higher Ed, a large chunk of universities around the country have consciously committed themselves to recruiting more students from rural areas. 30 percent of universities told Inside Higher Ed that they were committed to recruiting students from poor white families. Only 8 percent said they were committed to recruiting politically conservative students.  Bruni zoned in on the schools who have yet to establish a commitment to intellectual diversity. One faculty member at a progressive institution told Bruni that the lack of engagement with conservative thought and Trump supporters has lead to troubling stereotypes about Trump’s base.  “The idea that the only people who voted for Trump have missing front teeth is really so extraordinary, and yet I think that’s largely what people in the academy think,” said Jean Yarbrough, a conservative professor of political science at Bowdoin College who voted for Trump last November. She claims that her fellow faculty members view last year’s presidential election as “an illegitimate election, so they’re not worried about their being out of touch with America.”  “After the election I sensed, from talking to leaders of colleges, a lot of soul-searching about the fact that college presidents and students assumed that one thing was going to happen on Election Day and it did not,” Scott Jaschik, the editor of Inside Higher Ed, said in a comment to the Times. “Some people woke up the day after the election and realized that every surrounding county voted in a different way than the college did.”  Despite the issues with ideological conformity on campus, Bruni highlighted some of the universities that have made efforts to embrace and even promote conservative thought.  The University of Colorado, Boulder, announced in 2013 that they would establish a “visiting scholar in conservative thought” position, which would bring someone new from the political right to the faculty each year.  Michael Roth, the president of Wesleyan University, wrote earlier this year that “to create deeper intellectual and political diversity, we need an affirmative-action program for the full range of conservative ideas and traditions, because on too many of our campuses they seldom get the sustained, scholarly attention that they deserve.” Roth announced that Wesleyan would commit itself not only to admit at least ten military veterans each year but that they would offer a course on the philosophy of free enterprise.  Bruni finished his column with a clarification. “I’m not suggesting that colleges normalize Trump, validate everyone who backed him or make room for the viciously bigoted sentiments he often stoked. But there’s inquisitive, constructive territory short of that,” he finished.",http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2017/10/30/new-york-times-colleges-should-embrace-intellectual-diversity/

2844,Phani,,12,31,2099,JUST IN: LATINO GROUP Pulls Ad...Issues Statement On Disgusting Video of Latino Children Running From White Man: 'We held a mirror up to the Republican Party...'  ,"After receiving heavy backlash, the Latino Victory PAC took down the controversial ad depicting latino children running from a Confederate flag waving white male (video below)…It’s disgusting..  The PAC issued this statement:  “We knew our ad would ruffle feathers,” Latino Victory Fund President Cristóbal J. Alex began. “We held a mirror up to the Republican Party, and they don’t like what they see. We have decided to pull our ad at this time. Given recent events, we will be placing other powerful ads into rotation that highlight the reasons we need to elect progressive leaders in Virginia.”  Latino Victory Fund Statement: pic.twitter.com/VE8T3N3zI2 — Latino Victory (@latinovictoryus) October 31, 2017        *    Email *  Name        When supporters of the Democrat Party start using ads that appear to be inspired by Islamic acts of terror, you know they are not the party your parents and grandparents supported, and they’re certainly not the party that most Americans want to be affiliated with. When the Latino Victory group released a disgusting video (see below) a couple of days ago, many thought that it was made to resemble terror attacks that have become all too common in European nations. Sadly, today, that concept of using a truck as a weapon to kill innocent people became a reality in New York City, as an Islamic terrorist driver used a rented Home Depot truck as a weapon to kill 9 innocent people and to injure dozens more.  Note to Democrats: Creating a terror-inspired ad with a man chasing down innocent kids in a truck through their neighborhood is not funny, and it’s definitely not a clever way to get people to vote for your candidate.  According to FOX News – Democratic candidate for Virginia governor Ralph Northam is not distancing himself from the controversial ad suggesting supporters of Republican candidate Ed Gillespie are seen as Confederates who attack minority children.  The new opposition ad titled “American Nightmare” was released Monday by Democratic group Latino Victory Fund (LVF) and is scheduled to run through Election Day. The opposition ad shows minority children seemingly being chased by a driver in a pickup truck, decked out with a Confederate flag, a “Gillespie for governor” bumper sticker and a “Don’t tread on me” license plate.  The driver makes his way toward the scared children who shout, “Run! Run! Run!” when they see the truck. The ad concludes with a scene of a Charlottesville-like rally, with a narrator asking: “Is this what Donald Trump and Ed Gillespie mean by the ‘American Dream?’”  The Latino Victory group tweeted the video that was so violent, that Twitter has now suspended their account. Here is what their tweet said:  Ed Gillespie and Donald Trump promise the American dream, but can only deliver an American nightmare. No more. Vote @RalphNortham. #GameOnVA pic.twitter.com/mwpWXM47HZ — Latino Victory (@latinovictoryus) October 30, 2017  Northam’s campaign told Fox News Tuesday that the ad was “not shocking” based on Gillespie’s campaign.  “Independent groups are denouncing Ed Gillespie because he has run the most divisive, fear-mongering campaign in modern history,” Northam campaign spokeswoman Ofirah Yheskel said in a statement to Fox News. “It is not shocking that communities of color are scared of what his Trump-like policy positions mean for them.”  But Gillespie said the ad was “an attack on” his “supporters,” whom he calls “good decent hardworking Virginians who love their neighbors.”- FOX News  Making an ad that depicts a white man with a confederate flag flying from his pick-up truck, sporting an Ed Gillespie (Republican candidate for Governor) bumper sticker on the back, chasing minority kids around their neighborhood is not only sick, it is hateful and divisive.

2877,Phani,,12,31,2099,Facebook isn't the problem. We are,"Facebook, Google and Twitter executives and attorneys took to Capitol Hill this week to explain to the Senate Intelligence Committee their role in allowing Russian ad placement on their platforms during the 2016 election. The problem is members of this committee, and Congress in general, have little to no understanding about what those platforms are beyond their interns putting them on live video or tweeting out their policy agenda with a cool dancing hot dog.  The goal of the committee seems to be looking at the supposed role social media played in Hillary Clinton losing the 2016 election, though the driving force in these hearings seems to be more about one side venting their anger at their historic and surprising loss, while simultaneously looking for anything and anyone to blame but the candidate herself. They might just as well be speaking foreign languages to each other.  Silicon Valley tech-heads are fairly new to the D.C. game, as, at least for the time being, their industry goes largely unregulated and unmonitored – primarily because the outdated braintrust that is the United States Congress doesn’t understand their industry and hasn’t taken much time to learn about that “series of tubes.”  The core issue, we’re told, is foreign influence across these platforms by hostile governments, specifically Russia, whom we were told in a debate in 2012 by Barack Obama didn’t really matter much because the Cold War was over. The 80’s were calling. Four short years later, “Russia, Russia, Russia” seems to be the prevailing shouts from Capitol Hill. Russian- and Kremlin-backed troll farms spent upwards of $200,000 dollars in fake ads and news stories, primarily on Facebook, in an elaborate misinformation campaign targeted at U.S. voters. Seems like a lot until you compare, according to Facebook, that the Clinton and Trump campaigns spent a total of $81 million dollars on targeted ads.  When people think mainstream media is itself “Fake News,” people will turn to actual fake news outlets, because at the end of the day, they are at the very least more entertaining than Wolf Blitzer. The scourge of fake news against the American media was largely a self-inflicted wound.    Also, Facebook stated in its opening statement to the Committee that the paid content from Russian sources “equals about four-thousandths of one percent (0.004%) of content in News Feed, or approximately 1 out of 23,000 pieces of content.” General Counsel Colin Stretch went on to state, “Put another way, if each of these posts were a commercial on television, you’d have to watch more than 600 hours of television to see something from the IRA.” The IRA stands for Internet Research Agency, the farming company used by Russia.    When Senator Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, asked Twitter’s General Counsel Sean Edgett, “Is it biased to side with America over our adversaries?” Edgett simply responded “We’re trying to be unbiased around the world.” Silicon Valley views their products as data. Members of Congress either don’t see it that way, or don’t seem to understand how data is used or not used.  If there’s a reason Russia’s influence on Facebook seems wildly overblown, it’s because this too seems like an elaborate campaign of deflecting blame. Committee Democrats like Senator Al Franken, D-Minn., and Diane Feinstein, D-Calif., are unloading on Facebook, Google and Twitter attorneys, but it’s not because the tech giants are skirting some kind of grand responsibility Congress is putting on them.  As originally reported by Politico on November 14th of last year, Clinton campaign operatives declared they would be targeting “fake news” and Facebook for what they saw as another in a long line of excuses as to why their candidate lost. Teddy Goff, Clinton’s digital director, a central focus of her campaign, told Politico ""Everyone has the right to say what they want, have access to sites that they want, share what they want, but a publisher with a record of making stuff up is not likely to rank that highly on Google, and the equivalent ought to be the case on Facebook.” Clinton allies, or at the very least sympathizers, in media picked up the narrative and ran with it.  In the wake of a report that Russia’s ads, which went unlabeled (more on that in second), reached up to 146 million users, Democrats and the media are using this to once again bail out Hillary Clinton, and ever so slightly insinuate that the election on November 8th was stolen from her by an elaborate scheme that benefited Donald Trump. CNN’s Brian Stelter, who has made pounding the “fake news” drum his own personal hobby horse, suggested as much this week.  Eventually the media and Democrats leading the charge against Facebook, Google and Twitter will have to face a very hard ugly truth: Attempting to scapegoat tech companies over a failed presidential campaign will come across just as honest and well-intentioned as the candidate did herself.  “We’ve all had that experience of just scrolling through the newsfeed, just scrolling by items, not really paying attention. So most people may not have paid attention to this Russian propaganda” Stelter told fellow CNN host Brooke Baldwin. “But it didn’t take most people. It only took a couple million or you could even argue a couple hundred thousand, given how close the election was.”  But what Teddy Goff, or Brian Stelter or anyone else on Capitol Hill can’t say with certainly is just how much these ads influenced peoples’ votes beyond some magical power of assumption. And the data doesn’t seem to support Stelter’s argument.  Fake Facebook ads did not keep Hillary Clinton out of the state of Wisconsin for 105 days. Fake Facebook ads didn’t make the decision to pour more money into Nebraska and Louisiana over rust belt states where the big blue wall cracked wide open. Fake Facebook ads did not trigger an FBI investigation into Clinton and her associates’ private email server, including a laptop belonging to Anthony Weiner, which Huma Abedin chose not to turn over until weeks before the election. Fake Facebook ads did not call a swath of the American public a “basket of deplorables” and so on and so on.  Stelter and others’ main qualm seems to be that people just don’t pay enough attention to what’s in their Facebook newsfeed. Well, good luck legislating attention spans.  All Russian ads on Facebook can do is act as a billboard or a commercial. It’s ultimately the Facebook user’s responsibility on whether or not to believe an ad or not, and that is where legislating these platforms runs the risks of overstepping constitutional and legal boundaries.  The larger question to be asked involves media credibility itself, and since the shocking results of the election, introspection doesn’t seem to be our media’s strong suite.  Because of the loss of public trust in mainstream media outlets, audiences simply go elsewhere. They read outlets and news sites without such credible reputations as Dan Rather’s CBS or Brian Williams’ NBC. When people think mainstream media is itself “Fake News,” people will turn to actual fake news outlets, because at the end of the day, they are at the very least more entertaining than Wolf Blitzer. The scourge of fake news against the American media was largely a self-inflicted wound.    The problem with Facebook and Twitter isn’t the ads. It’s the audience. People, in the end, are going to believe what they want to believe. Facebook users are going to follow pages and feeds that may simply confirm their bias and cause a digital release of endorphins that simply confirm their worldview. They may also simply follow fake news pages for the entertainment. If the federal government at the behest of corporate media is seriously considering ridding Facebook of false memes and fake news, they better start with The Onion or Babylon Bee.    There are steps that Congress can take, and it looks like they will, to mitigate the effect of foreign-bought ads seen on social media. Ads on Facebook are not regulated by the FCC like campaign ads on television. That’s more than likely going to change. Users will most likely see a “paid for by” alert, similar to campaign ads on TV.  Also these companies will be pressured to treat Russian-bought ads as a form of sanctions violation, which will give the government the power to censor these ads across these platforms. I can’t imagine there will be much objection to that from either party involved.  But this will ultimately not stop the spread of false stories and memes. Pressuring Facebook to rid pages of false memes – like a professional football team burning an American flag – will lead down a road of free speech regulation that most Americans most likely will not support or tolerate.  Eventually the media and Democrats leading the charge against Facebook, Google and Twitter will have to face a very hard ugly truth: Attempting to scapegoat tech companies over a failed presidential campaign will come across just as honest and well-intentioned as the candidate did herself.  The issue is and has never been “fake news.” The issue has never been people believing fake ads on Facebook. The issue for them is that people simply don’t believe them anymore. And they simply didn’t trust Hillary Clinton.",http://www.foxnews.com//opinion/2017/11/01/facebook-isnt-problem-are.html
2895,Phani,,12,31,2099,"Trump echoes Fox & Friends to blame Democratic Sen. Schumer, diversity visa program for NYC terror attack","President Donald Trump echoed Fox & Friends after the show repeatedly blamed a diversity visa program and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) for a terror attack in Manhattan October 31 in which a man driving a pickup truck killed eight people.  Police shot and arrested the attack suspect, Sayfullo Saipov, after his vehicle smashed into a school bus. WABC, the ABC affiliate in New York City, reported that “authorities say he came to the United States seven years ago from Uzbekistan under what is called the Diversity Visa Program, which offers a lottery for people from countries with few immigrants in America.” Right-wing websites hyped this detail in their posts on the attack, though The Washington Post said it was “unconfirmed.” The Post explained that the diversity visa program originated in part in a bill Schumer introduced in the House in 1990, which was signed into law by Republican President George H.W. Bush.  After the Fox & Friends co-hosts and former Trump White House aide Sebastian Gorka in two separate segments castigated the diversity visa program as a security risk and Brian Kilmeade called on Schumer to publicly repudiate it, Trump followed his well-worn path of making public statements based on what he sees on the Fox News morning show, repeatedly calling out Schumer by name:  The terrorist came into our country through what is called the ""Diversity Visa Lottery Program,"" a Chuck Schumer beauty. I want merit based. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2017  We are fighting hard for Merit Based immigration, no more Democrat Lottery Systems. We must get MUCH tougher (and smarter). @foxandfriends — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2017  ""Senator Chuck Schumer helping to import Europes problems"" said Col.Tony Shaffer. We will stop this craziness! @foxandfriends — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2017  From the November 1 edition of Fox News’ Fox & Friends:  BRIAN KILMEADE (CO-HOST): All right, let's talk about how he got here. He applied to a lottery system, the diversity visa program, which was earmarked and highlighted back in 2011 in testimony as a huge weak spot for our country. You think so? Part of the visa lottery system allows you to apply to come here from places like Afghanistan, Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela, and try to get into this country. And you know what? Best of luck to you. And congratulations, you win the lottery and then eight people are run over in this case eventually down the line because of this. AINSLEY EARHARDT (CO-HOST): Right, 50,000 apply for this. And 1 percent of those -- actually 50,000 random people are selected. STEVE DOOCY (CO-HOST): Get in. EARHARDT: They get in. KILMEADE: Fifty thousand. EARHARDT: That’s fewer than 1 percent who actually apply for this. And they get permanent residency here in the U.S. It’s only offered to countries with low rates of immigration into the U.S. Does that seem like a good reason to you? DOOCY: Well, here’s the extraordinary thing about it. President Trump has made it very clear he wants to end the diversity visa program. He has said that over the last year. But if you win the lottery, then your family members are automatically also granted permanent residence. So if you get in, you get to bring your mom and dad over. You get to bring in your sisters. Everybody automatically gets a green card. […] DOOCY: So this particular alleged terrorist, brought in on this program that, according to Mark Levin, and I looked online, and there are a bunch of websites that say that Chuck Schumer was one of the sponsors. We have not independently confirmed that through our brain room yet. KILMEADE: Let's see if he comes out and says, “I’m responsible.” Look, if your intention was pure, you really think we need more diversity, although the [unintelligible] definition is diversity if you look all around you. If you really feel that way and felt that way in the 1990s, Chuck Schumer, come out today and say this thing is archaic, it’s antiquated, since 9/11 everything has changed, and this has got to be gone.",https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2017/11/01/trump-echoes-fox-friends-blame-democratic-sen-schumer-diversity-visa-program-nyc-terror-attack/218412
2916,Phani,,12,31,2099,Report: Russian Intel Officials May Be Charged in DNC Hack,"The Wall Street Journal cites “sources familiar with the investigation” in a Wednesday report claiming the Justice Department is close to charging six unnamed Russian government officials in last year’s reputed “hack” of the Democratic National Committee (DNC).  The Wall Street Journal claims the officials have been “identified” as being “involved” in the release of internal DNC emails showing systematic favoritism for candidate Hillary Clinton over rival Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). Separately from the leak, that narrative was given independent verification Wednesday in an upcoming book by interim-DNC Chairwoman Donna Brazile. She posits the DNC, in effect, turned over its operations to the Clinton campaign.  It is not clear from the reporting if the investigation referred to in the Wall Street Journal falls under Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office, but the story notes, “It is unclear if prosecutors will hold back filing charges until Mr. Mueller completes his investigation or wait to identify others who may have played a role in the DNC hack. Investigators believe dozens of others may have played a role in the cyberattack, the people said.”  The Special Counsel’s Office has seen a flurry of activity this week, revealing a serious 12-count indictment against one-time Donald Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort and his deputy, Richard Gates – unrelated to the 2016 campaign – and going public with the previously sealed guilty plea of a low-level campaign staffer for making false statements to the FBI.  The Wall Street Journal also claims, “U.S. intelligence agencies have attributed the attack to Russian intelligence services, but haven’t provided detailed information about how they concluded those services were responsible, or any details about the individuals allegedly involved.”  Omitted is the infamous – and now discredited – “17 intelligence agencies” claim.  Also missing was any mention of the July report of the Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS) group that claimed the leak could not possibly have been the result of a Russian hack. The validity of that study was called into question immediately upon its August publication by The Nation, and its accuracy would directly conflict with Wednesday’s Wall Street Journal report.  The six Russian officials are not expected to be in the United States or extraditable countries and the charges, it is implied, would be largely symbolic. Their issuance, however, would shed light on a narrative of Russian election interference that, so far, has remained effectively opaque.",http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/11/02/report-russian-intel-officials-may-be-charged-in-dnc-hack/

Like what you’re reading? Sign up to get Care in your inbox here.  House Republicans' tax bill does not try, again, to repeal the Affordable Care Act.  Instead, it takes aim at a much smaller health care program: a deduction for exceptionally high medical expenses. Today I want to run through how that program works — and what would happen if it goes away.  vox-mark Care 's email explaining the biggest news in health care, edited by Sarah Kliff Subscribe By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy. For more newsletters, check out our newsletters page  What is it? The medical expenses deduction allows people with especially high health care costs to deduct that spending on their tax reform. To qualify, you must spend at least 10 percent of your income on medical expenses. The IRS maintains a lengthy list of what counts as medical spending that includes some things you might expect, like fees paid to doctors or spending on prescription drugs. And there are some things you might not expect. Turns out, one can deduct the price of joining a weight loss club or attending a conference related to one's own health conditions. Self-employed individuals are typically able to deduct their insurance premiums, too.  Where did it come from? The medical expense deduction goes all the way back to the United States Revenue Act of 1942. Keep in mind this is two decades before Medicare and Medicaid were created. There was much less of a safety net for those with especially high medical bills.  There is some evidence that the deduction was meant to be a temporary postwar measure, as Kelly Phillips has previously detailed for Forbes. A Senate Finance Committee report on the 1942 tax bill justifies the medical deduction as follows:  This allowance is recommended in consideration of the heavy tax burden that must be borne by individuals during the existing emergency and of the desirability of maintaining the present high level of public health and morale.  About 80 years later, however, it's quite clear that this was not a temporary provision but rather a permanent part of the tax code. The only thing that has changed is how much medical expense one needs to qualify for the deduction. Most recently, the Affordable Care Act raised the threshold from 7.5 to 10 percent of income.  Who uses it? An estimated 8.8 million Americans use the deduction for medical expenses. This makes it one of the smaller deductions — it's nowhere near the size of the mortgage deduction, for example.  Most deductions benefit wealthier Americans, who are more likely to itemize their deductions in the first place. But the medical deduction is actually a bit different: It is used more by poorer tax filers than those who are especially rich.  The Congressional Research Service estimates that 3 percent of tax filers who earn less than $20,000 use the medical expenses deduction, compared to less than 1 percent of people earning more than $1 million.  And this, in a way, makes sense: Most people who earn more than $1 million have health insurance. In order to get above the 10 percent threshold, they would have to spend at least $100,000 out of pocket on medical expenses in the course of one year.  But someone who earns $20,000 would only need to spend $2,000 on medical expenses to cross the 10 percent threshold. And this is also a demographic that is less likely to have health insurance coverage.  What happens if the medical expenses deduction disappears? Most obviously, tax filers would no longer be able to deduct their medical expenses. And, as described earlier, this is one of the provisions of the tax code that currently helps a small subset of low-income Americans.  The AARP has opposed the elimination of the medical expense deduction. ""Eliminating the medical expense deduction amounts to a health tax on millions of Americans with high medical costs — especially middle income seniors,"" the group said in a statement. ""AARP is strongly opposed to this provision.""  Republicans, meanwhile, have argued that other changes in the tax bill would offset the loss of the medical expenses deduction for those who lose it. But as Dylan Matthews writes, this bill has winners and losers. Those who are wealthiest do best, while poor families would lose out under the current proposal.  Chart of the Day  Zeke Emanuel proposes new ""affordability index"" — and it shows health care getting less affordable  A novel approach to measuring health costs. Zeke Emanuel, Aaron Glickman, and David Johnson propose in the Journal of the American Medical Association a new ""affordability index"" as a way to measure health costs in America. It essentially compares the mean cost of employer-sponsored coverage to median household wages to get a sense of how big a burden health costs come out to be. It shows health care (unsurprisingly!) has gotten less affordable over the past two decades. Read more here.

We finally saw the GOP’s tax bill  After months of discussion and rumors, House Republicans finally rolled out actual legislative text for a tax bill, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which offers about $1.5 trillion in net tax cuts over 10 years. That money goes mostly, though not exclusively, to business owners and inheritors of large fortunes. But within the $1.5 trillion net change are much larger gross shifts, with some taxes going down and others going up, setting the stage for some potentially very complicated politics.  Key House sticking point: The bill would eliminate the existing state and local tax (SALT) deduction and replace it with a less generous property tax credit worth up to $10,000. This seems to be the key political sticking point in the House, where many members from California and the Northeast aren’t excited about raising taxes on their constituents.

Senate trouble ahead: The TCJA, as written, faces a huge problem in the Senate because a permanent, deficit-increasing tax cut — which is what the TCJA is — violates the terms of the budget reconciliation process and could be filibustered by Democrats unless it’s substantially rewritten.

What’s next? The House Ways and Means Committee will begin the formal “markup” process next week and, in theory, will consider amendments. But realistically, changes, if they happen, will be negotiated informally with House leadership. The Senate is also expected to release its own version of the bill next week.  Mueller revealed indictments — and a guilty plea  News leaked last weekend that special counsel Robert Mueller would unseal indictments on Monday, and he did — of former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort and his business associate Rick Gates for a range of financial crimes. But soon after came a surprise — a guilty plea, entered months ago, by former Trump campaign foreign policy aide George Papadopoulos for lying to the FBI.  Why it matters: That the president hired a criminal with compromising, illicit ties to Ukrainian oligarchs and Russian government figures, and then continued to employ his longtime business associate even after Manafort himself was fired, is significant on its own terms. Indeed, in a normal administration these basic facts would be a huge, news-dominating scandal.

Why it really matters: Issuing indictments while the investigation is still ongoing — especially when paired with the Papadopoulos plea — strongly suggests an effort to get Manafort or Gates (or both) to cut a deal and start cooperating with the investigators in exchange for leniency.

What’s next?

Jeff Sessions is back in the spotlight  Attorney General Jeff Sessions is one of the few non-family links between the senior levels of the Trump campaign and the senior levels of the Trump administration. Having already gotten himself into hot water by “forgetting” about meetings with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during his confirmation hearings, he’s coming under new pressure this week, as it turns out he was involved in discussions with lower-level campaign aides about potential collaboration with the Russian government.  A new story from Sessions’s camp: NBC News reported Thursday that Sessions aides are saying he heard and rejected Papadopoulos’s campaign-era proposal to use his “Russian contacts” to set up a meeting between Trump and Vladimir Putin. On one level, that’s an exculpatory story for Sessions. On another level, it appears to contradict his previous testimony that he had “no knowledge” about any campaign contacts with the Russians.

2967,Rohit,,12,31,2099,Daylight saving time ended Sunday: 6 things to know about “falling back”,"On Sunday, at 2 am, clocks turned back one hour, heralding the end of daylight saving time for much of the country. The change shifted daylight back into the morning hours. For 9-to-5 office workers, it means saying goodbye to leaving work while it’s still light out. And for weekend workers, it meant an additional glorious hour of sleep on Sunday.  And yet there’s a lot of confusion about daylight saving time.  The first thing to know: Yes, it ends in the fall, just as the decrease in daylight hours starts to become noticeable.  Let’s sort it all out.  1) Why do we need to “save” daylight hours in the summer?  Daylight saving time in the US started as an energy conservation trick during World War I, and became a national standard in the 1960s. The idea is to shift the number of daylight hours we get into the evening. So if the sun sets at 8 pm instead of 7 pm, we’d presumably spend less time with the lights on in our homes at night, saving on electricity.  It also means that you’re less likely to sleep through daylight hours in the morning (since those are shifted an hour later too). Hence “saving” daylight hours for the most productive time of the day.  Overall: We agree, the name is kind of confusing.  2) Isn’t it “daylight savings time” not “daylight saving time”?  No, it’s definitely called “daylight saving time.” Not plural.  3) Does it actually lead to energy savings?  As Joseph Stromberg outlined in an excellent 2015  article, the presumed electricity conservation from the time change is unclear or nonexistent:  Despite the fact that daylight saving time was introduced to save fuel, there isn't strong evidence that the current system actually reduces energy use — or that making it year-round would do so, either. Studies that evaluate the energy impact of DST are mixed. It seems to reduce lighting use (and thus electricity consumption) slightly but may increase heating and AC use, as well as gas consumption. It's probably fair to say that energy-wise, it's a wash.  4) What would happen if daylight saving time were abolished? Or if it were extended forever?  Currently, the state of Massachusetts is in the early stages of considering a proposal to stay on daylight saving time year round. It involves shifting into Atlantic time — which is an hour ahead of Eastern time — and then staying there the whole year. (Atlantic “standard” time, and Eastern “saving” time are the same.)  The plan is a long shot. The Boston Globe explains that the Massachusetts legislature and the Department of Transportation would both have to approve it. And similar bills have failed in Maine, New Hampshire, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. But its proponents say Massachusetts would benefit by having more sunlight hours in the afternoon and evening throughout the year.  And it wouldn’t be the only state to not observe the changing of the clocks. Much of Arizona currently ignores saving time.  But why stop at Massachusetts? It’s worth thinking about what would happen if Congress abolished daylight saving time (or kept it going all year long).  Blogger and cartographer Andy Woodruff decided to visualize this with an excellent series of maps.  The goal of these maps is to show how abolishing daylight saving time, extending it all year, or going with the status quo changes the amount of days we have “reasonable” sunrise and sunset times.  Reasonable, as defined by Woodruff, is the sun rising at 7 am or earlier or setting after 5 pm (so one could, conceivably, spend some time in the sun before or after work).  This is what the map looks like under the status quo of twice-yearly clock shifts. A lot of people have unreasonable sunrise times (the dark spots) for much of the year:  Here's how things would change if daylight saving were abolished (that is, if we just stuck to the time set in the winter all year). It’s better, particularly on the sunrise end:  And here's what would happen if daylight saving were always in effect. The sunrise situation would actually be worse for most people. But many more people would enjoy after-work light — and there’s a strong argument to make that this after-work light is actually worth more. (More on that below.)  (Note: The length of light we experience each day wouldn't actually change; that's determined by the tilt of Earth's axis. But we would experience it in times more accommodating for our modern world. Be sure to check out the interactive version of these maps on Woodruff’s website.)  In 2015, Stromberg made the compelling case that the daylight saving time shift into the evening should be extended year-round. Having more light later could benefit us in a surprising number of ways:  People engage in more leisure activities after work than beforehand, so we’d likely do more physical activity over sedentary leisure activities. Relatedly, studies show that kids get more exercise when the sun is out later in the evening.  Stromberg also cites some evidence that robberies decrease when there’s more sun in the evening hours.  There could be economic gains, since people “take short trips, and buy things after work — but not before — so a longer DST slightly increases sales,” Stromberg writes.  5) Is daylight saving time dangerous?  A little bit. In the spring time, when we shift clocks forward one hour, many of us will lose that hour of sleep. In the days after daylight saving time starts, our biological clocks are a little bit off. It’s like the whole country has been given one hour of jet lag.  One hour of lost sleep sounds like a small change, but we humans are fragile, sensitive animals. Small disruptions in our sleep have been shown to alter basic indicators of our health and dull our mental edge.  And when our biological clocks are off, everything about us is out of sync. Our bodies run this tight schedule to try to keep up with our actions. Since we usually eat a meal after waking up, we produce the most insulin in the morning. We're primed to metabolize breakfast before even taking a bite. It's more efficient that way.  (There’s some good research that finds taking over-the-counter melatonin helps reset our body clocks to a new time. Read more about that here).  Being an hour off schedule means our bodies are not prepared for the actions we partake in at any time of the day.  One example: driving.  In 1999, researchers at Johns Hopkins and Stanford universities wanted to find out what happens on the road when millions of drivers have their sleep disrupted.  Analyzing 21 years of fatal car crash data from the US National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, they found a very small, but significant, increase in road deaths on the Monday after the clock shift in the spring: The number of deadly accidents jumped to an average of 83.5 on the ""spring forward"" Monday compared with an average of 78.2 on a typical Monday.  And it seems it's not just car accidents. Evidence has also mounted of an increase in incidences of workplace injuries and heart attacks in the days after we spring forward.  6) How can we end daylight saving time, or extend it all year round?  That’s easy! Well, not really: All it would take is an act of Congress. But given the current pace of major legislation, I wouldn’t count on this happening anytime soon.",https://www.vox.com/2017/11/3/16598592/daylight-saving-time-ends-sunday-falling-back
2968,Rohit,,12,31,2099,C.D.C. Reports a Record Jump in Drug Overdose Deaths Last Year,"Deaths by drug overdose in the United States surged last year by more than 17 percent over 2015, another sign of the growing addiction crisis caused by opioids, according to a report released Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Preliminary data from the 50 states show that from the fourth quarter of 2015, through the fourth quarter of 2016, the rate of fatal overdoses rose to nearly 20 people per 100,000 from 16.3 per 100,000. The C.D.C. had previously estimated that about 64,000 people died from drug overdoses in 2016, with the highest rates reported in New Hampshire, Kentucky, West Virginia, Ohio and Rhode Island.  Drug overdoses have become the leading cause of death for Americans under 50. In recent years, according to Dr. Robert Anderson, chief of the C.D.C. mortality statistics branch, the deaths have been driven by overdoses of synthetic opioids, mostly fentanyl, rather than heroin.  “The main message is the drug rate went up a lot again, and of course we’re worried about it,” Dr. Anderson said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/health/deaths-drug-overdose-cdc.html
2973,Rohit,,12,31,2099,Thousands of heart patients get stents that may do more harm than good,"There’s an epidemic of unnecessary medical treatments, as David Epstein of ProPublica recently documented in a terrific investigation: Doctors routinely perform procedures that aren’t based on high-quality research, or even in spite of evidence that contradicts their use.  One of the prime examples of a dubious treatment that Epstein and others have pointed to is cardiologists putting little mesh tubes called stents in patients with stable angina — chest pain caused by clogged coronary arteries that arises only with physical exertion or emotional stress.  Doctors insert the devices into narrowed or blocked arteries to pop them open, helping blood flow to the heart again. The idea is that stents should help soothe the suffering of patients with angina (or chest pain) and drive down the risk of a heart attack and death in the future.  But studies show that stable angina can be well controlled with medication. And researchers have found that stenting chest pain patients doesn’t help them live longer or reduce their risk of disease — in fact, heart attacks and strokes can be potentially deadly side effects of stent procedures. There’s also been a lingering question about whether stents truly work to relieve pain.  Now, researchers from the United Kingdom have published a high-quality study in the Lancet that helps answer the pain question. Building on years of lower-quality evidence, the well-designed study suggests stents may in fact be useless for pain in people with stable angina who are being treated with medication.  ""Surprisingly, even though the stents improved blood supply, they didn't provide more relief of symptoms compared to drug treatments, at least in this patient group,"" said Rasha Al-Lamee, lead author of the study and a researcher at the National Heart and Lung Institute at Imperial College London, in a statement. This doesn’t mean stents should never be used in stable chest pain patients — some patients can’t take the medications that control angina, for example — but doctors may want to consider inserting these devices as a last resort.  Considering 500,000 patients get stents for stable angina each year in the US and Europe alone, and the devices can cost up to $67,000, depending on the hospital and a patient’s insurance coverage, the Lancet paper is poised to shake up cardiology, as the New York Times reported.  The trial is also important for another big reason: It raises critical questions about the quality of evidence doctors rely on to make life-and-death decisions for their patients.  The controversy over stents for patients with stable chest pain  Over the years, studies have been piling up that suggest stenting stable angina patients may not actually be all that helpful.  A decade ago, researchers published a study in the New England Journal of Medicine showing that stents did not improve patients’ mortality risk or cardiovascular disease outcomes. Since then, meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials on stents in stable angina patients have similarly found the devices don’t outperform more conservative medical therapies (such as medication) when it comes to preventing heart attacks or extending patients’ life expectancy in the long term.  There was still a question about using stents in stable patients, whether the devices could relieve chest pain in the shorter term. Data from low-quality studies suggested this was possible.  The only way to resolve the question would be to perform a double-blind “sham control” study of stents: giving half of the patients a fake stent and the other half a real stent, with both doctors and patients unaware of (or “blinded” to) which procedure they were involved with. Since we know medical procedures can produce a strong placebo effect, this kind of study could tease out whether it was the stent that was reducing patients’ pain or a placebo effect produced by the operation.  But no one had ever done a double-blind sham-control study — the gold standard of evidence for medical device studies — on stents in stable chest pain patients, until this new Lancet paper.  How researchers used a fake operation to test whether stenting works  The authors of the Lancet paper enrolled 230 patients with stable angina and at least one narrowed coronary vessel. For six weeks, they made sure the patients were getting the best medical treatment for angina, like beta blockers or long-acting nitroglycerine.  What came next rarely happens in medical device trials (and it’s why cardiologists are applauding this study): They gave half the patients a sham stent. So after the six-week startup phase, where patients were stabilized with medications, 195 of them were randomly assigned to get either a stent in their clogged artery or a sham stent procedure. The study was double-blinded — again, the patients and doctors didn’t know which procedure they were involved in — to reduce the risk of bias.  The doctors then followed up with their patients after another six weeks. The main outcome they were interested in was how much time each group could spend exercising on a treadmill, since angina often acts up with exertion. (They also looked at other secondary endpoints, such as changes in oxygen uptake and the severity of chest pain.) By the end of the study, the researchers found there were no clinically important differences between the real stent group and the sham stent group.  So actual stents didn’t outperform the placebo stents. “It’s just like a sugar pill,” said University of California San Francisco cardiologist Rita Redberg. “We know sugar pills make a lot of people feel better — though sugar procedures make even more people feel even better.”  Here’s the most disturbing part: One in 50 stent patients will experience serious complications — such as a heart attack, stroke, bleeding, or even death. So these devices don’t come without risks, and this Lancet paper again suggests they may not be helping patients.  “This should make us take a step back and ask questions about what we are accomplishing for this procedure,” said Yale cardiologist Harlan Krumholz.  David Brown, a Washington University School of Medicine cardiologist who has been studying the effects of stents for a decade, said he wasn’t surprised by the findings.  “[Stenting stable patients] is based on a simplistic 20th-century conceptualization of the disease,” he said. “It’s like the artery is a clogged pipe and if you relieve those blockages, the water will flow freely.” But this study suggests most patients’ pain symptoms may actually be coming from disease in their smaller blood vessels, not from blockages in the large coronary vessels that are always the targets for stents, he added.  In an editorial that accompanied the Lancet paper, Brown and Redberg wrote that medical guidelines need to change so that stenting for stable angina is only recommended as a last resort. “Patients should also be told that sham controlled trials don’t show any benefit,” Brown added.  This study speaks to a much bigger problem with medical evidence  The study represents the best available evidence on the impact of stenting for pain in stable angina patients — and could eventually avert unnecessary, costly procedures in the future. But the study is also important for what it says about the quality of medical evidence doctors often rely on to make decisions.  “This is a great example of a device that got on the market without ever having a high-quality trial behind it,” Redberg says. “For 40 years, we have been doing this procedure without any evidence that it’s better than a sham procedure.”  Right now, medical devices are less rigorously regulated than drugs: Only 1 percent of medical devices get FDA approval with high-quality clinical trials behind them. Even in these cases, devices typically reach the market based on data from a single small, short-term trial, Redberg wrote in a 2014 editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, where she called for a sham control study of stents.  The new Lancet study demonstrates why this kind of investigation is so critical in medicine. “The results of ORBITA show (once again) why regulatory agencies, the medical profession, and the public must demand high-quality studies before the approval and adoption of new therapies,” Redberg and Brown wrote in their recent editorial. Right now this isn’t happening. And stents surely aren’t the only device patients may be getting that are more placebo than proven, and have potentially deadly side effects.",https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/11/3/16599072/stent-chest-pain-treatment-angina-not-effective

This free upgrade closed down on July 31 of last year, leaving most users forced to pay the full price, with one notable exception. Any users who used what Microsoft defined as “assistive technology,” such as screen readers, had the chance to take the free upgrade, with an indefinite end date.  However, Microsoft has finally announced the end of this loophole, which is set to close on December 31 of this year. After that, anyone wanting to upgrade to Windows 10 will have to pay from around $75 or above for an upgrade license.  The definition of what counts as an “assistive technology” is rather broad, ensuring the maximum amount of people will still be able to upgrade for free. Microsoft explained its position in a support page:  We are not restricting the upgrade offer to specific assistive technologies… If you use assistive technology on Windows, you are eligible for the upgrade offer.  A cynical interpretation of this is that Microsoft is trying to ensure as many people upgrade to their latest operating system as possible. Arguably, anyone who has ever used the Windows Narrator tool has used an assistive technology. The more people that upgrade, the more it will benefit the company itself.

3042,Rohit,,12,31,2099,"America’s unique gun violence problem, explained in 17 maps and charts","America is an exceptional country when it comes to guns. It’s one of the few countries in which the right to bear arms is constitutionally protected. But America’s relationship with guns is unique in another crucial way: Among developed nations, the US is far and away the most homicidal — in large part due to the easy access many Americans have to firearms. These maps and charts show what that violence looks like compared with the rest of the world, why it happens, and why it’s such a tough problem to fix.  1) America has six times as many firearm homicides as Canada, and nearly 16 times as many as Germany  This chart, compiled using United Nations data collected by Simon Rogers for the Guardian, shows that America far and away leads other developed countries when it comes to gun-related homicides. Why? Extensive reviews of the research, compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health’s Injury Control Research Center, suggest the answer is pretty simple: The US is an outlier on gun violence because it has way more guns than other developed nations.  2) America has 4.4 percent of the world’s population, but almost half of the civilian-owned guns around the world  3) There have been more than 1,600 mass shootings since Sandy Hook  In December 2012, a gunman walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed 20 children, six adults, and himself. Since then, there have been more than 1,600 mass shootings.  The number comes from the Gun Violence Archive, which hosts a database that has tracked mass shootings since 2013. But since some shootings go unreported, the database is likely missing some, as well as the details of some of the events.  The tracker uses a fairly broad definition of “mass shooting”: It includes not just shootings in which four or more people were murdered, but shootings in which four or more people were shot at all (excluding the shooter).  Even under this broad definition, it’s worth noting that mass shootings make up a tiny portion of America’s firearm deaths, which totaled nearly 39,000 in 2016 alone.  4) On average, there is around one mass shooting for each day in America  Whenever a mass shooting occurs, supporters of gun rights often argue that it’s inappropriate to bring up political debates about gun control in the aftermath of a tragedy. For example, former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a strong supporter of gun rights, criticized former President Barack Obama for “trying to score cheap political points” when Obama mentioned gun control after a mass shooting in Charleston, South Carolina.  But if this argument is followed to its logical end, then it will just about never be the right time to discuss gun control, as Christopher Ingraham pointed out at the Washington Post. Under the broader definition of mass shootings, America has around one mass shooting a day. So if lawmakers are forced to wait for a time when there isn’t a mass shooting to talk gun control, they could find themselves waiting for a very long time.  5) States with more guns have more gun deaths  Using data from a study in Injury Prevention and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mother Jones put together the chart above that shows states with more guns tend to have far more gun deaths, including homicides and suicides. This has been found across the empirical research: “Within the United States, a wide array of empirical evidence indicates that more guns in a community leads to more homicide,” David Hemenway, the Harvard Injury Control Research Center’s director, wrote in Private Guns, Public Health.  Read more in Mother Jones’s “10 Pro-Gun Myths, Shot Down.”  6) It’s not just the US: Developed countries with more guns also have more gun deaths  7) America is an outlier when it comes to gun deaths, but not overall crime  It would be one thing if the US happened to have more crime than other nations, but the existing data shows that not to be the case. America is only an outlier when it comes to homicides and, specifically, gun violence, according to data from Jeffrey Swanson at Duke University.  As Zack Beauchamp explained for , a breakthrough analysis in the 1990s by UC Berkeley’s Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins found that the US does not, contrary to the old conventional wisdom, have more crime in general than other Western industrial nations. Instead, the US appears to have more lethal violence — and that’s driven in large part by the prevalence of guns.  “A series of specific comparisons of the death rates from property crime and assault in New York City and London show how enormous differences in death risk can be explained even while general patterns are similar,” Zimring and Hawkins wrote. “A preference for crimes of personal force and the willingness and ability to use guns in robbery make similar levels of property crime 54 times as deadly in New York City as in London.”  This is in many ways intuitive: People of every country get into arguments and fights with friends, family, and peers. But in the US, it’s much more likely that someone will get angry at an argument and be able to pull out a gun and kill someone.  8) States with tighter gun control laws have fewer gun-related deaths  When economist Richard Florida took a look at gun deaths and other social indicators, he found that higher populations, more stress, more immigrants, and more mental illness didn’t correlate with more gun deaths. But he did find one telling correlation: States with tighter gun control laws have fewer gun-related deaths. (Read more at Florida’s “The Geography of Gun Deaths.”)  This is backed by other research: A 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries, published in Epidemiologic Reviews, found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence — a strong indicator that restricting access to guns can save lives.  9) Still, gun homicides (like all homicides) have declined over the past couple decades  The good news is that firearm homicides, like all homicides and crime, have declined over the past two decades. (Although that may have changed in 2015 and 2016, with a recent rise in murders nationwide.)  There’s still a lot of debate among criminal justice experts about why this crime drop is occurring. Some of the most credible ideas include mass incarceration, more and better policing, and reduced lead exposure from gasoline. But one theory that researchers have widely debunked is the idea that more guns have deterred crime — in fact, the opposite may be true, based on research compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health’s Injury Control Center.  10) Most gun deaths are suicides  Although America’s political debate about guns tends to focus on grisly mass shootings and murders, a majority of gun-related deaths in the US are suicides. As Dylan Matthews explained for , this is actually one of the most compelling reasons for reducing access to guns: There is a lot of research that shows greater access to guns dramatically increases the risk of suicide.  11) The states with the most guns report the most suicides  12) Guns allow people to kill themselves much more easily  Perhaps the reason access to guns so strongly contributes to suicides is that guns are much deadlier than alternatives like cutting and poison.  Jill Harkavy-Friedman, vice president of research for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, previously explained that this is why reducing access to guns can be so important to preventing suicides: Just stalling an attempt or making it less likely to result in death makes a huge difference.  “Time is really key to preventing suicide in a suicidal person,” Harkavy-Friedman said. “First, the crisis won’t last, so it will seem less dire and less hopeless with time. Second, it opens the opportunity for someone to help or for the suicidal person to reach out to someone to help. That’s why limiting access to lethal means is so powerful.”  She added, “[I]f we keep the method of suicide away from a person when they consider it, in that moment they will not switch to another method. It doesn’t mean they never will. But in that moment, their thinking is very inflexible and rigid. So it’s not like they say, ‘Oh, this isn’t going to work. I’m going to try something else.’ They generally can’t adjust their thinking, and they don’t switch methods.”  13) Policies that limit access to guns have decreased suicides  When countries reduced access to guns, they saw a drop in the number of firearm suicides. The data above, taken from a study by Australian researchers, shows that suicides dropped dramatically after the Australian government set up a mandatory gun buyback program that reduced the number of firearms in the country by about one-fifth.  The Australian study found that buying back 3,500 guns per 100,000 people correlated with up to a 50 percent drop in firearm homicides and a 74 percent drop in gun suicides. As Dylan Matthews explained for , the drop in homicides wasn’t statistically significant (in large part because murders in Australia were already so low). But the drop in suicides most definitely was — and the results are striking.  Australia is far from alone in these types of results. A study from Israeli researchers found that suicides among Israeli soldiers dropped by 40 percent when the military stopped letting soldiers take their guns home over the weekend. The change was most pronounced during the weekends.  This data and research have a clear message: States and countries can significantly reduce the number of suicides by restricting access to guns.  14) In states with more guns, more police officers are also killed on duty  Given that states with more guns tend to have more homicides, it isn’t too surprising that, as a study in the American Journal of Public Health found, states with more guns also have more cops die in the line of duty.  Researchers looked at federal data for firearm ownership and homicides of police officers across the US over 15 years. They found that states with more gun ownership had more cops killed in homicides: Every 10 percent increase in firearm ownership correlated with 10 additional officers killed in homicides over the 15-year study period.  The findings could help explain why US police officers appear to kill more people than cops in other developed countries. For US police officers, the higher rates of guns and gun violence — even against them — in America mean that they not only will encounter more guns and violence, but they can expect to encounter more guns and deadly violence, making them more likely to anticipate and perceive a threat and use deadly force as a result.  15) Support for gun ownership has sharply increased since the early 2000s  Over the past two decades, Americans have shifted from mostly supporting the concept of gun control to greater support for protecting “the right of Americans to own guns,” according to Pew Research Center surveys. This shift has happened even as major mass shootings, such as the attacks on Columbine High School and Sandy Hook Elementary School, have received more press attention.  16) High-profile shootings don’t appear to lead to more support for gun control in the long term  Although mass shootings are often viewed as some of the worst acts of gun violence, they seem to have little effect on public opinion about gun rights, based on surveys from the Pew Research Center. That helps explain why Americans’ support for the right to own guns appears to have risen over the past few decades even as more mass shootings made the news.  17) Specific gun control policies are fairly popular  Although most Americans say they want to protect the right to own firearms, most also back many gun control proposals — such as stronger background checks, a database to track gun sales, and banning assault-style weapons, according to Pew Research Center surveys.  This type of contradiction isn’t exclusive to gun policy issues. For example, although most Americans in the past said they don’t like Obamacare, most of them also said they like the specific policies in the health care law. Americans just don’t like some policy ideas until you get specific.  For people who believe the empirical evidence that more guns mean more violence, this contradiction is the source of a lot of frustration. Americans by and large support policies that reduce access to guns. But once these policies are proposed, they’re broadly spun by politicians and pundits into attempts to “take away your guns.” So nothing gets done, and preventable deaths keep occurring.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/2/16399418/us-gun-violence-statistics-maps-charts
3044,Rohit,,12,31,2099,"How gun control works in America, compared with 4 other rich countries","The horrifying mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School offered yet another tragic reminder of America's gun problem: The US has much more firearm violence than its developed peers.  One reason for this difference is the abundance of guns in America. According to a 2007 survey, the US led the world in the number of civilian-owned firearms with 88.8 guns per 100 people, while second-place Yemen fell far behind at 54.8 guns per 100 people. And the research, compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health's Injury Control Research Center, has repeatedly found a link between a higher number of guns and higher levels of gun violence.  A common explanation for this is that America has some of the most lax gun laws in the world. But are US gun laws really that different from those of other developed nations?  I looked into that question, breaking down gun laws in several developed countries based on media reports, studies on gun violence, national databases, the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence's analysis of American gun laws, and the Law Library of Congress's reviews of gun laws around the world.  I found the US really does have the most relaxed gun control measures in comparison with other developed nations.  Based on the research, that's a significant reason the US leads its developed peers in gun violence. A 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries, published in Epidemiologic Reviews, found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence. That's a strong indicator that restricting access to guns can save lives.  Here's a guide to the gun control laws of some of the countries I looked at: the US, the United Kingdom, Canada, Switzerland, and Japan — a mix of wealthy nations with similar and varying cultural backgrounds.  United States  Gun ownership rate (2007): 88.8 guns per 100 people  Gun homicide rate (2012): 29.7 per 1 million people  How gun control works: There are several barriers to buying a gun in America, but there are generally so many loopholes in the current laws — even fairly restrictive city and state laws — that most people can buy a gun without too much of a problem.  Some people are technically prohibited from buying guns. People who are underage (under 18 for rifles and shotguns, and under 21 for other guns), someone convicted or indicted for a crime punishable by imprisonment of more than one year, fugitives from justice, the severely mentally ill, unlawful users of controlled substances, those convicted of domestic violence, and undocumented immigrants are among some of the categories of people barred from buying a firearm by federal law.  Some types of guns are also restricted. Under federal law, fully automatic weapons are technically legal only if made before 1986, so it's illegal to manufacture new automatic weapons for civilian use. Automatic weapons also tend to have more restrictions and registration requirements than other guns. Meanwhile, semiautomatic and non-automatic firearms are generally legal, barring state laws. And some states also ban high-capacity ammunition magazines.  Restrictions on purchasers are typically evaluated through a background check. Under the federal system, licensed dealers are required to run these checks before they can sell someone a gun, typically by having the FBI check a person's criminal record, mental health history, and other factors. If someone fails a background check, he or she can't legally buy a gun.  The most well-known way to bypass background checks is the private sales loophole: If someone purchases a gun from a private seller, such as a friend or family member, no gun background check is required. This is often mischaracterized as the gun show sale loophole, under the assumption that people can simply go to a gun show and buy a gun without getting a background check. But licensed dealers at gun shows still have to carry out a background check. The actual loophole is that someone can meet with a private seller at a gun show — or, increasingly, over the internet — and buy a firearm from that person without a background check. In other words, the gun show doesn't create a loophole; the private seller does.  But an equally big problem is that the system of background checks is notoriously underfunded, understaffed, and underresourced, allowing red flags to slip through. Although there are no waiting periods under federal law, a check that turns out inconclusive can be extended for three business days for further investigation. But these three days are a maximum for the government — and sometimes, the three days lapse without the FBI completing its check, and a buyer can, at that point, purchase a gun without the completed check.  The FBI admitted that something like this happened for Dylann Roof, who killed nine people at a predominantly black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015: Roof should have failed a background check for a handgun purchase after admitting to illegally possessing controlled substances in the past, but the FBI examiner did not obtain the shooter’s record in time.  The federal background check system also largely relies on states' reports, including some data for mental health history and criminal records. Since states have their own budget issues to deal with, or may simply ideologically oppose the idea of background checks, states' noncompliance can create yet another way the system can fail to stop someone who shouldn't buy a gun from obtaining one.  Of course, state laws vary widely. Some states restrict and ban certain types of firearms, particularly assault weapons. A few require certain licenses, registration, or training to buy and own certain guns. Several states ban or restrict open carry, and many require permits for concealed carry. Some require background checks and permits for private sales, and several rely on their own background checks instead of only the federal system. And many states try to make it as easy as possible to buy, own, and carry any type of gun. (Slate has a good rundown of differences in state laws.)  Many gun restrictions are limited by the Supreme Court's recent interpretations of the Second Amendment. For instance, the court struck down Washington, DC's handgun ban in 2008, citing an individual's right to bear arms.  Broadly speaking, studies have found that states with stricter gun control laws have fewer gun deaths, and places — not just states, but cities and countries, too — with fewer guns have less gun violence after controlling for socioeconomic variables and other types of crime.  Generally, America's gun laws are far more relaxed than those of the other countries on this list. And even if your city or state is restrictive, interstate travel is so easy that it's fairly easy to go to another state to buy a gun, although this runs afoul of some states' laws. Several analyses of places with restrictive gun laws — Chicago and Illinois or ""the Iron Pipeline,"" for example — have found that's exactly what happens in many cities and states, with guns typically flowing in from neighboring or nearby jurisdictions with laxer gun laws. The result: If you want to buy a gun in America, there's almost certainly a way to do just that, regardless of your local laws.  Canada  Gun ownership rate (2007): 30.8 guns per 100 people  Gun homicide rate (2012): 5.1 per 1 million people  How gun control works: Canada keeps guns somewhat accessible to the general population, but maintains major restrictions on different types of guns, who can buy them, and how they're purchased. The result is a system that looks like a stricter version of the US — so some sort of firearm ownership is still a possibility, but not something that's done very easily.  Canada puts guns into three categories: prohibited (most handguns that have a short barrel or are .32 or .25 caliber, fully automatic weapons, guns with sawed-off barrels, and certain military rifles like the AK-47), restricted (some handguns, some semiautomatic rifles, and certain non-semiautomatic rifles), and non-restricted (regular and some military-style shotguns and rifles). The general idea is that more dangerous guns face much harsher regulations and restrictions on purchase, ownership, and storage.  Prohibited guns are, as their name implies, prohibited, but people who obtained and maintained a registration certificate before they were banned in December 1998 can keep those specific guns. All restricted and prohibited firearms must be registered, but non-restricted guns no longer have to be registered after April 2012.  In general, you must be 18 or older to buy a gun in Canada. Some exceptions are made for minors 12 to 17 owning a non-restricted firearm — but only if a licensed adult is responsible for the gun.  Canada requires a license to own a gun and ammunition, and buyers to pass safety course tests. Licenses must be renewed every five years.  Licensing requires fairly stringent background checks. An ""applicant for a firearm license in Canada must pass background checks, which consider criminal, mental, addiction and domestic violence records,"" according to the Library of Congress's review of Canada's laws. The background checks also consider whether an applicant has been treated for a mental illness, if the person was associated with violence, threats, or attempted violence, and whether the person has a history of any behavior ""that includes violence or threatened or attempted violence on the part of the person against any person."" On top of traditional background checks, each license applicant needs to submit third-party character references.  In addition to licensing requirements, Canadians can only obtain a permit to carry firearms in public in very limited circumstances — typically with the requirement that ""an individual needs restricted firearms or prohibited handguns for use in connection with his or her lawful profession or occupation"" or to protect life. There are no such federal requirements in the US, although some states place certain restrictions or bans on concealed and open carry.  Unlike federal laws in the US, Canadian laws require safe gun storage — locked in a room, compartment, or container that's difficult to break into, with a trigger or cable lock, or both, depending on the type of firearm. Guns must be unloaded when stored. And similar storage requirements apply to guns that are being transported, with laxer rules for non-restricted firearms compared to prohibited and restricted ones.  United Kingdom  Gun ownership rate for England and Wales (2007): 6.2 guns per 100 people  Gun homicide rate for England and Wales (2012): 0.7 per 1 million people  How gun control works: The United Kingdom maintains some of the strictest gun laws in the West and the world, which helps explain why it also has some of the lowest levels of gun homicide among developed nations.  For one, handguns are generally banned, with exceptions only for police officers, members of the armed forces, and people with special permission from the home secretary. Military-style weapons are also prohibited.  For other types of firearms and ammo, individuals must go through a stringent licensing process. They must give a ""good reason"" — such as job requirements, sport, or shooting vermin — to own a gun. Self-defense is not considered a good reason. Local police chiefs are expected to verify that an applicant's reasons for owning a gun are legitimate. For example, police might see if a person really has vermin in his or her house to the point that it requires a certain type of gun to deal with the pests.  Gun owners also must meet background checks, which involve a review of a person's criminal record, mental illness, alcoholism, drug addiction, and references regarding mental state, home life, and attitudes toward guns. Licenses must be renewed every five years, although they can be revoked earlier if police find that someone's gun ownership poses public safety risks or a person no longer has a good reason for the license.  The UK also has an age requirement of 18 for gun ownership. Firearm ownership also might involve storage requirements that meet ""British safety standards,"" which are evaluated by local police, who particularly check the possibility of unauthorized access to guns by an owner's family members or other associates.  One major exemption to the licensing requirements: People can participate in gun clubs even if they don't hold a certificate ""when engaged as a member of the club in connection with target shooting,"" according to the Library of Congress's review of UK laws. But these gun clubs must meet all sorts of criteria, including security and storage arrangements for guns and ammo.  Gun laws can be enforced very strictly: Anyone found unlawfully possessing a firearm faces a five-year mandatory minimum prison sentence.  The UK passed many of its gun restrictions in response to public outcry after several mass shootings. One of the shootings sounds eerily like the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that took place in Connecticut in 2012, as described by Clare Feikert-Ahalt for the Library of Congress: In 1996, ""Thomas Hamilton walked into a primary (elementary) school in Dunblane, Scotland, and shot and killed 16 small children, aged four to five, and their teacher in the school gym before killing himself. Hamilton lawfully held the two rifles and four handguns that he used for the massacre, and had lawfully held firearms for almost 20 years prior to this incident.""  According to Feikert-Ahalt's report, law enforcement's consensus in the UK is that the restrictions did not stop all gun violence, but did limit it. And although the rules are strict, more than 700,000 certificates were in effect for the period between 2008 and 2009, suggesting that gun ownership is certainly possible despite the hurdles involved.  Switzerland  Gun ownership rate (2007): 45.7 guns per 100 people  Gun homicide rate (2012): 7.7 per 1 million people  How gun control works: Switzerland is perceived to have one of the more accepting cultures toward guns in Europe. Laws let militia members in the country (where all able-bodied men are required to serve in the military, except for conscientious objectors) keep their issued personal weapons in their homes, and Swiss statutes and traditions respect the right to bear arms.  But the country's restrictions are still somewhat more stringent than the US.  For one, automatic weapons are outright banned for civilians.  Private gun ownership generally requires a license, for which an applicant ""must be at least 18 years of age, may not have been placed under guardianship, may not give cause for suspicion that he would endanger himself or others with the weapon, and may not have a criminal record with a conviction for a violent crime or of several convictions for nonviolent crimes,"" according to the Library of Congress's review of Swiss gun laws. The license is valid for six to nine months, and it's usually valid only for one weapon.  But rifles and semiautomatic long arms used by recreational hunters are exempt from licensing requirements.  The licensing requirement also only applies to dealers, with an exemption for private sellers. Still, the law requires private sellers to verify the identity and age of the buyer by checking an official identification document, and private sellers must have no reason to believe the buyer has been or should be disqualified from firearm ownership — requirements that aren't necessary for private gun sales under US federal law.  For anyone to carry a gun for defensive purposes, the licensing process requires the applicant to demonstrate the need to protect himself or others and pass an exam. But no carrying license is required for transporting an unloaded weapon for ""legitimate purposes"" like hunting and traveling to a shooting range, as long as the ammo is kept separate from the weapon. In comparison, the license to carry is a requirement that only exists in a minority of US states.  In recent years, Switzerland has reformed its gun laws for militia members after several incidents in which militia members killed themselves or others with their issued weapons. In 2010, for instance, rules were amended to let militia members voluntarily deposit their guns in an armory. And if police, courts, prosecutors, or a military commandant finds danger of abuse or improper handling or maintenance of a militia member's personal weapon, it can be confiscated — with the possibility of further punishments, including fines and imprisonment.  Switzerland's restrictions show that a country can have a culture that is broadly more receptive to the idea of gun ownership while maintaining some restrictions that make firearms less accessible to potentially dangerous people and improve public safety. But it's perhaps no coincidence that the country is second only to America among developed nations in terms of firearm homicide deaths — although the Swiss rate is still four times lower than the US's rate.  Japan  Gun ownership rate (2007): 0.6 guns per 100 people  Gun homicide rate (2012): 0.1 per 1 million people  How gun control works: Japan makes it very hard to buy and own guns, with some of the strongest gun control laws in the world. The system is so restrictive that even Japan's criminals, which through the notorious yakuza can be highly ingrained in corrupt government agencies, largely see gun ownership as a liability, as 's Zack Beauchamp explained.  ""Under current laws, if a low-level yakuza is caught with a gun and bullets that match, he’ll be charged with aggravated possession of firearms and will then face an average seven-year prison term,"" longtime Japan correspondent Jake Adelstein wrote in the Japan Times. ""Simply firing a gun carries a penalty of three years to life. And … a yakuza boss may decide a death sentence is more appropriate if his thug miraculously gets released on bail before going to jail [because accomplice laws could get the boss indicted along with his subordinate].""  In a 2012 article for the Atlantic, 's Max Fisher explained the rigorous process for buying and owning a firearm, which can only be done for special purposes like hunting, professional necessity, and gun competitions:  To get a gun in Japan, first, you have to attend an all-day class and pass a written test, which are held only once per month. You also must take and pass a shooting range class. Then, head over to a hospital for a mental test and drug test (Japan is unusual in that potential gun owners must affirmatively prove their mental fitness), which you'll file with the police. Finally, pass a rigorous background check for any criminal record or association with criminal or extremist groups, and you will be the proud new owner of your shotgun or air rifle. Just don't forget to provide police with documentation on the specific location of the gun in your home, as well as the ammo, both of which must be locked and stored separately. And remember to have the police inspect the gun once per year and to re-take the class and exam every three years.  In addition to these requirements, there are age restrictions for gun ownership — 18 generally, 14 for athletes, and 20 for hunters. People can't fire their guns except for the specific reasons given for obtaining a firearm in the first place. And officials have enormous authority for supervising someone's gun ownership, including the ability to conduct nationwide inspections of gun owners' weapons and storage facilities — with prior notice to gun owners — and the ability to require owners to temporarily submit guns to the authorities following a disaster or incident that disturbs the public peace.  On top of those restrictions, there's a separate permit for buying ammunition, which can also limit how much ammo someone can buy.  Civilian possession of handguns is also banned, except for research purposes.  Partly as a result of its stringent laws, Japan has very low levels of gun violence — not just compared with the US, but compared with any other country. As Fisher wrote in 2012, there was a bit of a national scandal when the number of gun homicides in Japan — a country of nearly 130 million — rose from two in 2006 to 22 in 2007, even though both are shockingly low rates of gun homicides. In 2013, the gun homicide rate was 350 times higher in the US than in Japan.  None of this is to suggest that one could simply import Japanese — or other nations' — gun laws to the US, easily implement such policies, and see US gun violence fall to match its developed peers. After all, the US, Japan, the UK, Canada, and Switzerland are very different countries with varied cultural and socioeconomic influences. And non-US countries started with comparatively few guns in circulation, so it's been relatively easy to restrict guns and keep their prominence low — whereas the US now has more guns than people, so it would be much harder to scale back access to firearms and levels of gun ownership.  But based on the research and other countries' experiences, more restrictive gun laws could at the very least make shooting deaths much less common in the US.

3046,Rohit,,12,31,2099,"America’s gun problem, explained","On Saturday, it happened again: another mass shooting in America. This time, a gunman killed multiple people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh.  Already, the mass shooting has given rise to new calls for gun control laws. “We must deal with access to guns,” Fred Guttenberg, an activist for stricter gun laws, tweeted. “We must stop simply giving people who intend to kill the weapons to do it with.”  But if this plays out like the aftermath of past mass shootings, from Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 to Las Vegas in 2017, the chances of Congress taking major action on guns is very low.  This has become an American routine: After every mass shooting, the debate over guns and gun violence starts up once again. Maybe some bills get introduced. Critics respond with concerns that the government is trying to take away their guns. The debate stalls. So even as America continues experiencing levels of gun violence unrivaled in the rest of the developed world, nothing happens — no laws are passed by Congress, nothing significant is done to try to prevent the next horror.  So why is it that for all the outrage and mourning with every mass shooting, nothing seems to change? To understand that, it’s important to grasp not just the stunning statistics about gun ownership and gun violence in the United States, but America’s very unique relationship with guns — unlike that of any other developed country — and how it plays out in our politics to ensure, seemingly against all odds, that our culture and laws continue to drive the routine gun violence that marks American life.  1) America’s gun problem is completely unique  No other developed country in the world has anywhere near the same rate of gun violence as America. The US has nearly six times the gun homicide rate as Canada, more than seven times as Sweden, and nearly 16 times as Germany, according to UN data compiled by the Guardian. (These gun deaths are a big reason America has a much higher overall homicide rate, which includes non-gun deaths, than other developed nations.)  To understand why that is, there’s another important statistic: The US has by far the highest number of privately owned guns in the world. Estimated for 2017, the number of civilian-owned firearms in the US was 120.5 guns per 100 residents, meaning there were more firearms than people. The world’s second-ranked country was Yemen, a quasi-failed state torn by civil war, where there were 52.8 guns per 100 residents, according to an analysis from the Small Arms Survey.  Another way of looking at that: Americans make up less than 5 percent of the world’s population, yet they own roughly 45 percent of all the world’s privately held firearms.  That does not, however, mean that every American adult actually owns guns. In fact, gun ownership is concentrated among a minority of the US population — as surveys from the Pew Research Center and General Social Survey suggest.  These three basic facts demonstrate America’s unique gun culture. There is a very strong correlation between gun ownership and gun violence — a relationship that researchers argue is at least partly causal. And American gun ownership is beyond anything else in the world. At the same time, these guns are concentrated among a passionate minority, who are typically the loudest critics against any form of gun control and who scare legislators into voting against such measures.  2) More guns mean more gun deaths. Period.  The research on this is overwhelmingly clear: No matter how you look at the data, more guns mean more gun deaths.  This is apparent when you look at state-by-state data for gun ownership and gun deaths (including homicides and suicides) within the United States, as this chart from Mother Jones demonstrates:  And it’s clear when you look at the data for gun ownership and gun deaths (including homicides and suicides) across developed nations, as this chart, based on data from GunPolicy.org, shows:  Opponents of gun control tend to point to other factors to explain America’s unusual levels of gun violence — particularly mental illness. But people with mental illnesses are more likely to be victims, not perpetrators, of violence. And Michael Stone, a psychiatrist at Columbia University who maintains a database of mass shooters, wrote in a 2015 analysis that only 52 out of the 235 killers in the database, or about 22 percent, were mentally ill. “The mentally ill should not bear the burden of being regarded as the ‘chief’ perpetrators of mass murder,” Stone concluded. Other research has backed this up.  Another argument you sometimes hear is that these shootings would happen less frequently if even more people had guns, thus enabling them to defend themselves from a shooting.  But, again, the data shows this is simply not true. High gun ownership rates do not reduce gun deaths, but rather tend to coincide with increases in gun deaths. While a few people in some cases may use a gun to successfully defend themselves or others, the proliferation of guns appears to cause far more violence than it prevents.  Multiple simulations have also demonstrated that most people, if placed in an active shooter situation while armed, will not be able to stop the situation, and may in fact do little more than get themselves killed in the process.  This video, from ABC News, shows one such simulation, in which people repeatedly fail to shoot an active shooter before they’re shot:  The relationship between gun ownership rates and gun violence rates, meanwhile, is well established. Reviews of the evidence, compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health’s Injury Control Research Center, have consistently found that when controlling for variables such as socioeconomic factors and other crime, places with more guns have more gun deaths. Researchers have found this to be true not just with homicides, but also with suicides, domestic violence, and even violence against police.  For example, a 2013 study, led by a Boston University School of Public Health researcher, found that, after controlling for multiple variables, each percentage point increase in gun ownership correlated with a roughly 0.9 percent rise in the firearm homicide rate.  As a breakthrough analysis by UC Berkeley’s Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins in the 1990s found, it’s not even that the US has more crime than other developed countries. This chart, based on data from Jeffrey Swanson at Duke University, shows that the US is not an outlier when it comes to overall crime:  Instead, the US appears to have more lethal violence — and that’s driven in large part by the prevalence of guns.  “A series of specific comparisons of the death rates from property crime and assault in New York City and London show how enormous differences in death risk can be explained even while general patterns are similar,” Zimring and Hawkins wrote. “A preference for crimes of personal force and the willingness and ability to use guns in robbery make similar levels of property crime 54 times as deadly in New York City as in London.”  Guns are not the only contributor to violence. (Other factors include, for example, poverty, urbanization, and alcohol consumption.) But when researchers control for other confounding variables, they have found time and time again that America’s high levels of gun ownership are a major reason the US is so much worse in terms of gun violence than its developed peers.  To deal with its problem, America will have to not only make guns less accessible, but likely reduce the number of guns in the US as well.  The research also speaks to this point: A 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries, published in Epidemiologic Reviews, found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence — a strong indicator that restricting access to guns can save lives.  But even with the outrage over gun massacres, the sense that enough is enough, and the clear evidence that the problem is America’s high gun ownership rates, there hasn’t been significant legislation to help solve the problem.  3) Americans tend to support measures to restrict guns, but that doesn’t translate into laws  If you ask Americans how they feel about specific gun control measures, they will often say that they support them. According to Pew Research Center surveys, most people in the US support universal background checks, a federal database to track gun sales, bans on assault-style weapons, and bans on high-capacity magazines.  So why don’t these measures ever get turned into law? That’s because they run into another political issue: Americans, increasingly in recent years, tend to support the abstract idea of the right to own guns.  This is part of how gun control opponents are able to kill even legislation that would introduce the most popular measures, such as background checks that include private sales (which have upwards of 80 percent support, according to Pew): They’re able to portray the law as contrary to the right to own guns, and galvanize a backlash against it.  This kind of problem isn’t unique to guns. For example, although many Americans say they don’t like Obamacare, most of them do in fact like the specific policies in the health care law. The problem is these specific policies have been masked by rhetoric about a “government takeover of health care” and “death panels.” Since most Americans don’t have time to verify these claims, especially when they involve a massive bill with lots of moving parts, enough end up believing in the catchphrases and scary arguments to stop the legislation from moving forward.  Of course, it’s also the case that some Americans simply oppose any gun control laws. And while this group is generally outnumbered by those who support gun control, the opponents tend to be much more passionate about the issue than the supporters — and they’re backed by a very powerful political lobby.  4) The gun lobby as we know it is relatively recent but enormously powerful  The single most powerful political organization when it comes to guns is, undoubtedly, the National Rifle Association (NRA). The NRA has an enormous stranglehold over conservative politics in America, and that development is more recent than you might think.  The NRA was, for much of its early history, more of a sporting club than a serious political force against gun control, and even supported some gun restrictions. In 1934, NRA president Karl Frederick was quoted as saying, “I do not believe in the general promiscuous toting of guns. I think it should be sharply restricted and only under licenses.”  A 1977 revolt within the organization changed everything. As crime rose in the 1960s and ’70s, calls for more gun control grew as well. NRA members worried new restrictions on guns would keep coming after the historic 1968 law — eventually ending, they feared, with the government’s seizure of all firearms in America. So members mobilized, installing a hard-liner known as Harlon Carter in the leadership, forever changing the NRA into the gun lobby we know today.  This foundation story is crucial for understanding why the NRA is near-categorically opposed to the regulation of private firearms. It fears that popular and seemingly common-sense regulations, such as banning assault-style weapons or a federal database of gun purchases, are not really about saving lives but are in fact a potential first step toward ending all private gun ownership in America, which the NRA views — wrongly, in the minds of some legal experts — as a violation of the Second Amendment of the US Constitution.  So any time there’s an attempt to impose new forms of gun control, the NRA rallies gun owners and other opponents of gun control to kill these bills. These gun owners make up a minority of the population: anywhere from around 30 to around 40 percent of households, depending on which survey one uses. But that population is a large and active enough constituency, particularly within the Republican base, to make many legislators fear that a poor grade from the NRA will end their careers.  As a result, conservative media and politicians take the NRA’s support — especially the coveted A-to-F ratings the organization gives out — very seriously. Politicians will go to sometimes absurd length to show their support for gun rights. In 2015, for example, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) starred in a video, from IJ Review, in which he cooked bacon with — this is not a joke — a machine gun.  Although several campaigns have popped up over the years to try to counteract the NRA, none have come close to capturing the kind of influential hold that the organization has.  Kristin Goss, author of The Gun Debate: What Everyone Needs to Know, previously told me this might be changing. She argued that newer gun control groups like Everytown for Gun Safety and Americans for Responsible Solutions are much more organized, are better funded, and have more grassroots support than gun control groups have had in her decades covering this issue. As a result, Democrats at the state and federal levels seem much more willing to discuss gun control.  But supporters of gun control face a huge obstacle: far more passionate opponents. As Republican strategist Grover Norquist said in 2000, “The question is intensity versus preference. You can always get a certain percentage to say they are in favor of some gun controls. But are they going to vote on their ‘control’ position?” Probably not, Norquist suggested, “but for that 4-5 percent who care about guns, they will vote on this.”  What’s behind that passion? Goss, who’s also a political scientist at Duke University, suggested that it’s a sense of tangible loss — gun owners feel like the government is going to take their guns and rights. In comparison, gun control advocates are motivated by more abstract notions of reducing gun violence — although, Goss noted, the victims of mass shootings and their families have begun putting a face on these policies by engaging more actively in advocacy work, which could make the gun control movement feel more relatable. (See: #NeverAgain.)  There is an exception at the state level, where legislatures have passed laws imposing (and relaxing) restrictions on guns. In the past few years, for instance, Washington state and Oregon passed laws ensuring all guns have to go through background checks, including those sold between individuals. “There’s a lot more going on than Congress,” Goss said. “In blue states, gun laws are getting stricter. And in red states, in some cases, the gun laws are getting looser.”  But state laws aren’t enough. Since people can cross state lines to purchase guns under laxer rules, the weaker federal standards make it easy for someone to simply travel to a state with looser gun laws to obtain a firearm and ship it to another state. This is such a common occurrence that the gun shipment route from the South, where gun laws are fairly loose, to New York, where gun laws are strict, has earned the name “the Iron Pipeline.” But it also happens all across the country, from New York to Chicago to California. Only a federal law could address this issue — by setting a floor on how loose gun laws can be in every state. And until such a federal law is passed, there will always be a massive loophole to any state gun control law.  Yet the NRA’s influence and its army of supporters push many of America’s legislators, particularly at the federal level and red states, away from gun control measures — even though some countries that passed these policies have seen a lot of success with them.  5) Other developed countries have had huge successes with gun control  In 1996, a 28-year-old man walked into a cafe in Port Arthur, Australia, ate lunch, pulled a semiautomatic rifle out of his bag, and opened fire on the crowd, killing 35 people and wounding 23 more. It was the worst mass shooting in Australia’s history.  Australian lawmakers responded with legislation that, among other provisions, banned certain types of firearms, such as automatic and semiautomatic rifles and shotguns. The Australian government confiscated 650,000 of these guns through a mandatory gun buyback program, in which it purchased the firearms from gun owners. It established a registry of all guns owned in the country and required a permit for all new firearm purchases. (This is much further than bills typically proposed in the US, which almost never make a serious attempt to immediately reduce the number of guns in the country.)  The result: Australia’s firearm homicide rate dropped by about 42 percent in the seven years after the law passed, and its firearm suicide rate fell by 57 percent, according to one review of the evidence by Harvard researchers.  It’s difficult to know for sure how much of the drop in homicides and suicides was caused specifically by the gun buyback program and other legal changes. Australia’s gun deaths, for one, were already declining before the law passed. But researchers David Hemenway and Mary Vriniotis argue that the gun buyback program very likely played a role: “First, the drop in firearm deaths was largest among the type of firearms most affected by the buyback. Second, firearm deaths in states with higher buyback rates per capita fell proportionately more than in states with lower buyback rates.”  One study of the program, by Australian researchers, found that buying back 3,500 guns per 100,000 people correlated with up to a 50 percent drop in firearm homicides, and a 74 percent drop in gun suicides. As Dylan Matthews noted for , the drop in homicides wasn’t statistically significant because Australia has a pretty low number of murders already. But the drop in suicides most definitely was — and the results are striking:  One other fact, noted by Hemenway and Vriniotis in 2011: “While 13 gun massacres (the killing of 4 or more people at one time) occurred in Australia in the 18 years before the [Australia gun control law], resulting in more than one hundred deaths, in the 14 following years (and up to the present), there were no gun massacres.”  6) Although they get a lot of focus, mass shootings are a small portion of all gun violence  Depending on which definition of a mass shooting one uses, there are anywhere from a dozen to hundreds of mass shootings in the US each year. These events are, it goes without saying, devastating tragedies for the nation and, primarily, the victims and their families.  Yet other, less-covered kinds of gun violence kill far more Americans than even these mass shootings. Under a broad definition of mass shooting, these incidents killed fewer than 500 people in the US in 2016. That represents less than 2 percent of the nearly 39,000 gun deaths that year — most of which were suicides, not homicides.  Preventing suicides isn’t something we typically include in discussions of gun control, but other countries’ experiences show it can save lives. In Israel, where military service is mandatory for much of the population, policymakers realized that an alarming number of soldiers killed themselves when they went home over the weekend. So Israeli officials, as part of their solution, decided to try forcing the soldiers to keep their guns at the base when they went home. It worked: A study from Israeli researchers found that suicides among Israeli soldiers dropped by 40 percent.  So while politicians often lean on mass shootings to call for gun control, the problem goes far beyond those incidents. Though it’s hard to fault them for trying; mass shootings, after all, force Americans to confront the toll of our gun laws and gun culture.  But it seems that we as a nation just aren’t willing to look, or else don’t sufficiently mind what we see, when these events occur. Even the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in Newtown, Connecticut — in which a gunman killed 20 young children, six school personnel, and himself — catalyzed no significant change at the federal level and most states. Since then, there have been, by some estimates, more than 1,800 mass shootings. And there is every reason to believe there will be more to come.",https://www.vox.com/2015/10/3/9444417/gun-violence-united-states-america
3048,Rohit,,12,31,2099,Tesla Stock Plunges $5.5B as Model 3 Suffers 6-Month Delay,"The value of Tesla Inc. stock plunged by about $5.4 billion over a 48-hour period this week as the company declared a large quarterly loss and finally acknowleded that deliveries of its high-volume Model 3 will be delayed by at least 6 months.  Tesla (OTC: TSLA) has only made a profit in one quarter of its 14-year existence, and that was only due to selling federal and state tax credits to traditional auto manufactures and others that actually do make taxable profits.  Although Tesla’s $2.98 billion third quarter revenue slightly beat Wall Street analysts’ estimates, the company lost $671 million, or $2.92 per share. That was twice the-$336 million loss in the prior quarter, and set an all-time cash burn high of $16 million per day.   News reported in early October that CEO Elon Musk had announced that Tesla Inc. had its “all-time best quarter” with record deliveries of 26,150 vehicles, including 14,065 Model S sedans; 11,865 Model X SUVs; and 220 Model 3 economy cars. That was considered a disappointment for Model 3 deliveries, and its stock sold off by 1 percent.  But Musk emphasized that through “physics-first principles,” Tesla would shape a new mode of industrial production to improve efficiency by “factors of 10 or even 100 times.” He said Tesla’s key advantage in building all-electric vehicles was limiting the number of moving engine parts to 20, versus up to 10,000 for internal combustion engines.  With investors reassured that Tesla was on track to ramp up to delivering 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week in the December quarter and 10,000 per week in the March quarter, Tesla’s stock traded up on big volume to an interim high of $362.55 on October 18.  But the stock opened at $301.15 per share on November 2 and has been trading down after Musk acknowledged on the company’s third quarter conference call that it is “difficult to predict” when the bottlenecks will be cleared in production of Model 3s. He said he did not expect to be at 5,000 Model 3 units a week until late March.  Musk tried to reassure shareholders that he is “leading from the front lines” to battle “production hell” delays. Tesla said the main problem holding up production of the Model 3s were production delays at Tesla’s $5 billion Gigafactory in Reno, Nevada, where Panasonic four-battery cell modules are automatically inserted into an aluminum-wrapped battery case. Musk referred to his Instagram post last week where he is having a late-night campfire with a couple of managers on the Gigafactory’s roof as a sign of his focus.  Musk did assign some blame for production delays on the Model 3 being more automated, compared to the company’s largely hand-built luxury Model S sedans and Model X SUVs. Musk stated that “bringing this level of automation online is simply challenging in the early stages of the ramp.”  But he failed to comment on Edward Niedermeyer’s brilliant October 30 report in the Daily Kanban industrial blog that Tesla did not give a purchase order to a major automated tooling supplier to develop two “Body in White” (BIW) transfer lines for the Model 3 early this year. Although car companies normally place fully-designed orders for BIW lines with at least a two-year lead time, and BIW manufacturers almost always assemble and test the line at their factories, Tesla asked for a 4-month delivery and wanted to expedite delivery by doing a risky “cold build” line layout and quality testing at Tesla’s factory.  Niedermeyer added that “disagreements between Tesla’s designers and engineers resulted in numerous revisions to the scope of the contract and eventually led Tesla to drop the second line from its purchase order.” The BIW vendor blamed Tesla’s high level of turnover in key positions, which  News has highlighted in the past. Without the second BIW assembly line, Tesla can never produce 10,000 units per week.  In another example of Tesla failing to have enough lead time to produce Model 3 units, Panasonic’s Chief Executive Kazuhiro Tsuga told Reuters that Gigafactory batteries are still being mostly made by hand. “This process (for battery packs) will be soon automated, and then the number of vehicles to be produced will rise sharply.” Tsuga declined to comment on how far Tesla Model 3 production is behind its targeted delivery schedule.",http://www.breitbart.com/california/2017/11/03/tesla-stock-plunges-5-5b-as-model-3-suffers-6-month-delay/

Trump is on a five country trip through Asia traveling to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. (Kiyoshi Ota/Pool Photo via AP)  TOKYO (AP) — Responding to a U.S. mass shooting for the second time in six weeks, President Donald Trump said Monday that it wasn’t “a guns situation” that was behind the slayings of more than two dozen worshippers at a Texas church a day earlier.  As he did following last month’s Las Vegas massacre of 58 people, Trump resisted any discussion of gun control during a news conference in Tokyo, where he was beginning his first presidential trip to Asia. Instead, Trump characterized the shooting as a “mental health problem at the highest level.” Yet White House officials said Trump is unlikely to call for a specific policy response, as he did after last week’s Islamic State group-inspired truck attack, which killed eight people in New York City.  Devin Kelley, the Texas gunman, was discharged from the Air Force several years ago for assaulting his spouse and a child, the Air Force said.  “This was a very — based on preliminary reports — a very deranged individual. A lot of problems over a long period of time,” Trump said when asked about the shooting as he and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe held a joint news conference.  Speaking from Tokyo, President Donald Trump called the deadly church shooting in Texas Sunday ""an act of evil."" (Nov. 5)  Trump’s more muted response to gun violence contrasts with his swift call for legislative and military action following the Oct. 31 truck attack in New York City. Within hours of a rental truck ramming through a crowded bicycle path and into a school bus, Trump called for Congress to “immediately” repeal the diversity visa lottery program that suspect Sayfullo Saipov, an Uzbekistan citizen, used to enter the country in 2010. Trump also claimed that the U.S. had already stepped up its retaliation against the Islamic State group after the attack.  “We are hitting them 10 times harder,” he said Friday.  After the Las Vegas shooting, Trump and aides said it was inappropriate to consider a policy response while people were still grieving. Despite days later suggesting openness to outlawing the bump stock device that allowed Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock to fire at near-automatic rates, the Trump administration has shown no signs of urgency.  “He has asked that that process be reviewed, and we’re waiting on some of the details of that to take place,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Oct. 27 when asked about bump stocks. “But a decision hasn’t been finalized on that. ”  Trump, who supported gun control before reversing his position to enter the Republican presidential primary, courted the National Rifle Association’s endorsement in 2016, and earlier this year became the first president in three decades to speak at the gun group’s annual convention.  In February, Trump signed legislation reversing an Obama-era regulation that would have made it harder for Americans with mental illnesses to buy a gun.  Under the Obama rule, the Social Security Administration would have been required to send in the names of beneficiaries with mental impairments who needed a third party to manage their financial affairs. The rule would have affected an estimated 75,000 beneficiaries who would have been added to the national background check database.  The attack happened in South Texas on Sunday morning when a man dressed in black tactical-style gear and armed with an assault rifle opened fire inside a Baptist church in a small community, killing 26 people and wounding 20 others in the deadliest mass shooting in state history.  As Kelley left the scene, authorities said, he was confronted by an armed resident. Kelley later was found dead in his vehicle.  Trump said, “Fortunately somebody else had a gun that was shooting in the opposite direction, otherwise it (wouldn’t) have been as bad as it was. It would have been much worse.”  Investigators believe Kelley shot himself.  ___   writers Kevin Freking, Catherine Lucey and Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this report.","https://www.apnews.com//a24697e089d14422bf0a42e227cf8089/Trump:-Texas-mass-shooting-is-about-mental-health,-not-guns"

Zero Hedge – In a shocking development, late on Saturday the Saudi press reported that prominent billionaire, member of the royal Saudi family, and one of the biggest shareholders of Citi, News Corp. and Twitter – not to mention frequent CNBC guest – Al-Waleed bin Talal, along with ten senior princes, and some 38 ministers, has been arrested for corruption and money laundering charges on orders from the new anti-corruption committee headed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, while Royal princes’ private planes have been grounded.  Among those fired and/or arrested are the head of National Royal Guards, Miteb Bin Abdullah, the Minister of Economy and Planning, Adel Fakeih, and Admiral Abdullah bin Sultan bin Mohammed Al-Sultan, the Commander of the Saudi Naval Forces.    As the local press further adds, the supreme committee chaired by Crown Prince and billionaire stops “on charges of money laundering.”        *    Email *  Phone      al-Waleed bin Talal is perhaps best known not only for his periodic CNBC appearances, but for his recurring on and off spats with president Trump:  According to al Arabiya, among those sacked and/or arrested are Moteib Bin Abdullah, Minister of the National Guard, and Prince Khalid bin Ayyaf has been appointed as his replacement. A second Royal Order was issued to relieve Minister of Economy and Planning, Adel al-Faqieh, from his duties, and the appointment of Mohammed Al Tuwaijri as Minister of Economy and Planning.  According to a Royal Decree issued by King Salman on Saturday the anti-corruption committee is chaired by the Crown Prince with the membership of: Chairman of the Monitoring and Investigation Commission, Chairman of the National Anti-Corruption Authority, Chief of the General Audit Bureau, Attorney General and Head of State Security.  As Saudi analysts were quick to point out, the purge by the Saudi King means that King Abdallah’s last remnants (Riyad firmer gov. & head of Nat. Guard); media moguls; SAGIA & financial policy officials have been purged.  As Bloomberg notes, changing the head of the National Guard, an institution that’s been controlled by the clan of the late King Abdullah, “is not like changing the minister of oil,” said Kamran Bokhari, a senior analyst with Geopolitical Futures and a senior fellow with the Center for Global Policy. “I wouldn’t be surprised if this leads to greater fissures within the royal family.”  Arabiya adds that King Salman also issued sacking and replacement orders for Admiral Abdullah bin Sultan bin Mohammed Al-Sultan, the Commander of the Naval Forces, is to be terminated and be retired; his replacement is Vice Admiral Fahd bin Abdullah Al-Ghifaili, to be promoted to the rank of admiral and be appointed as Commander of the Naval Forces.  Additionally, Minister of Economy and Planning Adel al-Faqieh was replaced by Mohammed al-Tuwaijri, SPA said, quoting a royal decree. Commander of the Saudi Navy, Abdullah al-Sultan, was replaced with Fahad al-Ghafli. The king also replaced Minister of Economy and Planning Adel Fakeih withMohammad Al Tuwaijri, his deputy.

3116,Rohit,,12,31,2099,Menendez corruption and bribery case: What to know,"Sen. Bob Menendez will not face a new bribery and corruption trial after all, federal prosecutors said last month.  The Department of Justice had announced earlier this year that it intended to retry the New Jersey Democrat after a federal judge declared a mistrial in the case in November, but ultimately walked away from the pursuit.  Menendez was accused of accepting a plethora of donations and gifts from a wealthy friend in exchange for political influence. Both Menendez and the doctor, Salomon Melgen, maintained their innocence.  “From the very beginning, I never wavered in my innocence and my belief that justice would prevail. I am grateful that the Department of Justice has taken the time to reevaluate its case and come to the appropriate conclusion,” Menendez said on social media following the announcement.  Menendez is up for re-election this year. He was selected to replace former Gov. Jon Corzine, D-N.J., in the Senate in 2005. He rejoined the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee as its ranking member on Feb. 6, after stepping down from the post when he was indicted in 2015.  Read on for a look at what Menendez was accused of and what happened in the trial.  What was Menendez accused of?  Menendez, 64, accepted an abundance of campaign donations, gifts and vacations from Salomon Melgen, a Florida ophthalmologist, prosecutors alleged when Menendez faced trial in 2017. In return, prosecutors claimed, he used his position to lobby on behalf of Melgen’s business interests.  Melgen allegedly directed more than $750,000 in campaign contributions to entities that supported Menendez, according to the indictment, which prosecutors said were inducements to get Menendez to use his influence on Melgen's behalf. Prosecutors have also accused Menendez of trying to hide the gifts.  Melgen paid for Menendez and his girlfriend to stay for three nights at a Parisian hotel where rooms typically cost about $1,500 per night and allowed the senator the use of his private jet, according to prosecutors.  Federal prosecutors said that Menendez “sold his office for a lifestyle that he couldn’t afford.”  The indictment also alleged that Menendez pressured State Department officials to give visas to three young women described as Melgen's girlfriends.  What was the senator’s defense?  Both Menendez and Melgen pleaded not guilty – and Menendez has vehemently denied the accusations against him.  Throughout the original trial, defense attorneys sought to prove that Menendez and Melgen have been friends since before the former became a senator, and the trips were nothing more than friends traveling together.  Is there anything else to know about Salomon Melgen?  Melgen, 63, was convicted of 67 counts of health care fraud in April 2017 in what the Palm Beach Post called one of the biggest Medicare fraud cases in the U.S.  Melgen was sentenced to 17 years in prison on Feb. 22 for Medicare fraud, as he persuaded patients to undergo treatments they did not necessarily need.  Aside from Menendez, Melgen has given significant amounts of money to a variety of Democratic lawmakers, according to public records.  How did the trial end?  After the jury again informed the judge they could not reach a decision, U.S. District Court Judge William H. Walls declared a mistrial, saying he found “no alternative.”  The mistrial was declared on Nov. 16.

3121,Rohit,,12,31,2099,Thousands of heart patients get stents that may do more harm than good,"There’s an epidemic of unnecessary medical treatments, as David Epstein of ProPublica recently documented in a terrific investigation: Doctors routinely perform procedures that aren’t based on high-quality research, or even in spite of evidence that contradicts their use.  One of the prime examples of a dubious treatment that Epstein and others have pointed to is cardiologists putting little mesh tubes called stents in patients with stable angina — chest pain caused by clogged coronary arteries that arises only with physical exertion or emotional stress.  Doctors insert the devices into narrowed or blocked arteries to pop them open, helping blood flow to the heart again. The idea is that stents should help soothe the suffering of patients with angina (or chest pain) and drive down the risk of a heart attack and death in the future.  But studies show that stable angina can be well controlled with medication. And researchers have found that stenting chest pain patients doesn’t help them live longer or reduce their risk of disease — in fact, heart attacks and strokes can be potentially deadly side effects of stent procedures. There’s also been a lingering question about whether stents truly work to relieve pain.  Now, researchers from the United Kingdom have published a high-quality study in the Lancet that helps answer the pain question. Building on years of lower-quality evidence, the well-designed study suggests stents may in fact be useless for pain in people with stable angina who are being treated with medication.  ""Surprisingly, even though the stents improved blood supply, they didn't provide more relief of symptoms compared to drug treatments, at least in this patient group,"" said Rasha Al-Lamee, lead author of the study and a researcher at the National Heart and Lung Institute at Imperial College London, in a statement. This doesn’t mean stents should never be used in stable chest pain patients — some patients can’t take the medications that control angina, for example — but doctors may want to consider inserting these devices as a last resort.  Considering 500,000 patients get stents for stable angina each year in the US and Europe alone, and the devices can cost up to $67,000, depending on the hospital and a patient’s insurance coverage, the Lancet paper is poised to shake up cardiology, as the New York Times reported.  The trial is also important for another big reason: It raises critical questions about the quality of evidence doctors rely on to make life-and-death decisions for their patients.  The controversy over stents for patients with stable chest pain  Over the years, studies have been piling up that suggest stenting stable angina patients may not actually be all that helpful.  A decade ago, researchers published a study in the New England Journal of Medicine showing that stents did not improve patients’ mortality risk or cardiovascular disease outcomes. Since then, meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials on stents in stable angina patients have similarly found the devices don’t outperform more conservative medical therapies (such as medication) when it comes to preventing heart attacks or extending patients’ life expectancy in the long term.  There was still a question about using stents in stable patients, whether the devices could relieve chest pain in the shorter term. Data from low-quality studies suggested this was possible.  The only way to resolve the question would be to perform a double-blind “sham control” study of stents: giving half of the patients a fake stent and the other half a real stent, with both doctors and patients unaware of (or “blinded” to) which procedure they were involved with. Since we know medical procedures can produce a strong placebo effect, this kind of study could tease out whether it was the stent that was reducing patients’ pain or a placebo effect produced by the operation.  But no one had ever done a double-blind sham-control study — the gold standard of evidence for medical device studies — on stents in stable chest pain patients, until this new Lancet paper.  How researchers used a fake operation to test whether stenting works  The authors of the Lancet paper enrolled 230 patients with stable angina and at least one narrowed coronary vessel. For six weeks, they made sure the patients were getting the best medical treatment for angina, like beta blockers or long-acting nitroglycerine.  What came next rarely happens in medical device trials (and it’s why cardiologists are applauding this study): They gave half the patients a sham stent. So after the six-week startup phase, where patients were stabilized with medications, 195 of them were randomly assigned to get either a stent in their clogged artery or a sham stent procedure. The study was double-blinded — again, the patients and doctors didn’t know which procedure they were involved in — to reduce the risk of bias.  The doctors then followed up with their patients after another six weeks. The main outcome they were interested in was how much time each group could spend exercising on a treadmill, since angina often acts up with exertion. (They also looked at other secondary endpoints, such as changes in oxygen uptake and the severity of chest pain.) By the end of the study, the researchers found there were no clinically important differences between the real stent group and the sham stent group.  So actual stents didn’t outperform the placebo stents. “It’s just like a sugar pill,” said University of California San Francisco cardiologist Rita Redberg. “We know sugar pills make a lot of people feel better — though sugar procedures make even more people feel even better.”  Here’s the most disturbing part: One in 50 stent patients will experience serious complications — such as a heart attack, stroke, bleeding, or even death. So these devices don’t come without risks, and this Lancet paper again suggests they may not be helping patients.  “This should make us take a step back and ask questions about what we are accomplishing for this procedure,” said Yale cardiologist Harlan Krumholz.  David Brown, a Washington University School of Medicine cardiologist who has been studying the effects of stents for a decade, said he wasn’t surprised by the findings.  “[Stenting stable patients] is based on a simplistic 20th-century conceptualization of the disease,” he said. “It’s like the artery is a clogged pipe and if you relieve those blockages, the water will flow freely.” But this study suggests most patients’ pain symptoms may actually be coming from disease in their smaller blood vessels, not from blockages in the large coronary vessels that are always the targets for stents, he added.  In an editorial that accompanied the Lancet paper, Brown and Redberg wrote that medical guidelines need to change so that stenting for stable angina is only recommended as a last resort. “Patients should also be told that sham controlled trials don’t show any benefit,” Brown added.  This study speaks to a much bigger problem with medical evidence  The study represents the best available evidence on the impact of stenting for pain in stable angina patients — and could eventually avert unnecessary, costly procedures in the future. But the study is also important for what it says about the quality of medical evidence doctors often rely on to make decisions.  “This is a great example of a device that got on the market without ever having a high-quality trial behind it,” Redberg says. “For 40 years, we have been doing this procedure without any evidence that it’s better than a sham procedure.”  Right now, medical devices are less rigorously regulated than drugs: Only 1 percent of medical devices get FDA approval with high-quality clinical trials behind them. Even in these cases, devices typically reach the market based on data from a single small, short-term trial, Redberg wrote in a 2014 editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, where she called for a sham control study of stents.  The new Lancet study demonstrates why this kind of investigation is so critical in medicine. “The results of ORBITA show (once again) why regulatory agencies, the medical profession, and the public must demand high-quality studies before the approval and adoption of new therapies,” Redberg and Brown wrote in their recent editorial. Right now this isn’t happening. And stents surely aren’t the only device patients may be getting that are more placebo than proven, and have potentially deadly side effects.",https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/11/3/16599072/stent-chest-pain-treatment-angina-not-effective
3124,Rohit,,12,31,2099,Daylight saving time ended Sunday: 6 things to know about “falling back”,"On Sunday, at 2 am, clocks turned back one hour, heralding the end of daylight saving time for much of the country. The change shifted daylight back into the morning hours. For 9-to-5 office workers, it means saying goodbye to leaving work while it’s still light out. And for weekend workers, it meant an additional glorious hour of sleep on Sunday.  And yet there’s a lot of confusion about daylight saving time.  The first thing to know: Yes, it ends in the fall, just as the decrease in daylight hours starts to become noticeable.  Let’s sort it all out.  1) Why do we need to “save” daylight hours in the summer?  Daylight saving time in the US started as an energy conservation trick during World War I, and became a national standard in the 1960s. The idea is to shift the number of daylight hours we get into the evening. So if the sun sets at 8 pm instead of 7 pm, we’d presumably spend less time with the lights on in our homes at night, saving on electricity.  It also means that you’re less likely to sleep through daylight hours in the morning (since those are shifted an hour later too). Hence “saving” daylight hours for the most productive time of the day.  Overall: We agree, the name is kind of confusing.  2) Isn’t it “daylight savings time” not “daylight saving time”?  No, it’s definitely called “daylight saving time.” Not plural.  3) Does it actually lead to energy savings?  As Joseph Stromberg outlined in an excellent 2015  article, the presumed electricity conservation from the time change is unclear or nonexistent:  Despite the fact that daylight saving time was introduced to save fuel, there isn't strong evidence that the current system actually reduces energy use — or that making it year-round would do so, either. Studies that evaluate the energy impact of DST are mixed. It seems to reduce lighting use (and thus electricity consumption) slightly but may increase heating and AC use, as well as gas consumption. It's probably fair to say that energy-wise, it's a wash.  4) What would happen if daylight saving time were abolished? Or if it were extended forever?  Currently, the state of Massachusetts is in the early stages of considering a proposal to stay on daylight saving time year round. It involves shifting into Atlantic time — which is an hour ahead of Eastern time — and then staying there the whole year. (Atlantic “standard” time, and Eastern “saving” time are the same.)  The plan is a long shot. The Boston Globe explains that the Massachusetts legislature and the Department of Transportation would both have to approve it. And similar bills have failed in Maine, New Hampshire, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. But its proponents say Massachusetts would benefit by having more sunlight hours in the afternoon and evening throughout the year.  And it wouldn’t be the only state to not observe the changing of the clocks. Much of Arizona currently ignores saving time.  But why stop at Massachusetts? It’s worth thinking about what would happen if Congress abolished daylight saving time (or kept it going all year long).  Blogger and cartographer Andy Woodruff decided to visualize this with an excellent series of maps.  The goal of these maps is to show how abolishing daylight saving time, extending it all year, or going with the status quo changes the amount of days we have “reasonable” sunrise and sunset times.  Reasonable, as defined by Woodruff, is the sun rising at 7 am or earlier or setting after 5 pm (so one could, conceivably, spend some time in the sun before or after work).  This is what the map looks like under the status quo of twice-yearly clock shifts. A lot of people have unreasonable sunrise times (the dark spots) for much of the year:  Here's how things would change if daylight saving were abolished (that is, if we just stuck to the time set in the winter all year). It’s better, particularly on the sunrise end:  And here's what would happen if daylight saving were always in effect. The sunrise situation would actually be worse for most people. But many more people would enjoy after-work light — and there’s a strong argument to make that this after-work light is actually worth more. (More on that below.)  (Note: The length of light we experience each day wouldn't actually change; that's determined by the tilt of Earth's axis. But we would experience it in times more accommodating for our modern world. Be sure to check out the interactive version of these maps on Woodruff’s website.)  In 2015, Stromberg made the compelling case that the daylight saving time shift into the evening should be extended year-round. Having more light later could benefit us in a surprising number of ways:  People engage in more leisure activities after work than beforehand, so we’d likely do more physical activity over sedentary leisure activities. Relatedly, studies show that kids get more exercise when the sun is out later in the evening.  Stromberg also cites some evidence that robberies decrease when there’s more sun in the evening hours.  There could be economic gains, since people “take short trips, and buy things after work — but not before — so a longer DST slightly increases sales,” Stromberg writes.  5) Is daylight saving time dangerous?  A little bit. In the spring time, when we shift clocks forward one hour, many of us will lose that hour of sleep. In the days after daylight saving time starts, our biological clocks are a little bit off. It’s like the whole country has been given one hour of jet lag.  One hour of lost sleep sounds like a small change, but we humans are fragile, sensitive animals. Small disruptions in our sleep have been shown to alter basic indicators of our health and dull our mental edge.  And when our biological clocks are off, everything about us is out of sync. Our bodies run this tight schedule to try to keep up with our actions. Since we usually eat a meal after waking up, we produce the most insulin in the morning. We're primed to metabolize breakfast before even taking a bite. It's more efficient that way.  (There’s some good research that finds taking over-the-counter melatonin helps reset our body clocks to a new time. Read more about that here).  Being an hour off schedule means our bodies are not prepared for the actions we partake in at any time of the day.  One example: driving.  In 1999, researchers at Johns Hopkins and Stanford universities wanted to find out what happens on the road when millions of drivers have their sleep disrupted.  Analyzing 21 years of fatal car crash data from the US National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, they found a very small, but significant, increase in road deaths on the Monday after the clock shift in the spring: The number of deadly accidents jumped to an average of 83.5 on the ""spring forward"" Monday compared with an average of 78.2 on a typical Monday.  And it seems it's not just car accidents. Evidence has also mounted of an increase in incidences of workplace injuries and heart attacks in the days after we spring forward.  6) How can we end daylight saving time, or extend it all year round?  That’s easy! Well, not really: All it would take is an act of Congress. But given the current pace of major legislation, I wouldn’t count on this happening anytime soon.",https://www.vox.com/2017/11/3/16598592/daylight-saving-time-ends-sunday-falling-back

Gillespie welcomed the president’s get-tough-on-crime message, but didn’t have much to say about Trump himself.  That didn’t go unnoticed by one big Trump supporter, John Fredericks, a talk radio host in Southern Virginia who asked Gillespie during a Friday conference call with reporters whether he wanted the president to campaign for him down the stretch.  Fredericks told the Washington Examiner in a subsequent interview that Gillespie’s hesitance to embrace Trump could cost him on Election Day.  “Ed failed to capitalize on a golden opportunity to amplify the president’s enthusiastic endorsement of him,” said Fredericks, who served as the vice chairman of the Trump campaign in 2016.  “I was flabbergasted that the Gillespie campaign chose to downplay the president’s tweet,” he added. “This is a game changer. If Ed can motivate Trump voters to show up on Nov. 7, he’ll win this election. A simple re-tweet and thank you would have gone a long way in solidifying Trump voters’ support for Gillespie.”  After it was announced that Gillespie had lost the race, Diamond and Silk, who are Trump’s #1 fan girls, tweeted a message to “Republican Politicians that’s running for office: If you don’t support our President and his agenda, then the people will not Support you!”  #AlwaysBetOnTrump  A message to these Republican Politicians that's running for office: If you don't support our President and his agenda, then the people will not Support you! #AlwaysBetOnTrump pic.twitter.com/nRxdTWKOgK — Diamond and Silk® (@DiamondandSilk) November 8, 2017  Time will tell, but it was probably the biggest mistake of Ed Gillespie’s political career to not ask President Trump to campaign in Virginia on his behalf.",https://100percentfedup.com/diamond-silk-message-gop-candidates-dont-embrace-trump-ed-gillespie-loses-governors-race-va/

President Trump has made 56 nominations thus far to the federal courts to fill the 166 current and upcoming vacancies on the bench, with more coming soon. Those nominees are the most consistently and provably conservative picks of any president since the courts became a political issue more than a half-century ago.  There is not been a conservative majority on the Supreme Court since 1934—more than 80 years. Since that time, the Court has gone back and forth between right-leaning moderate, moderate, left-leaning moderate, liberal, and very liberal. Never conservative.  Federal judges are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, then serve for life. Conservatives say that the only legitimate way for unelected and politically unaccountable judges to interpret the Constitution and lesser laws in America’s democratic form of government is according to the original public meaning of their words. Those who hold to this belief are called originalists.  After eight decades of the Supreme Court’s deviating from the original meaning of the Constitution, the federal government has exploded in size and scope, blurring the Constitution’s separation of powers, undermining its checks and balances, and violating its guarantees of the role government plays in the lives of American citizens.  Donald Trump understood that. After the sudden passing of the iconic Justice Antonin Scalia, candidate Trump promised that if elected, he would nominate judges in the mold of Scalia.  Given that Trump did not have any background in law or a long public record of supporting conservative judges, critics balked. They considered it playing to the GOP base for votes.  Trump responded by working with the Federalist Society, which is the flagship conservative legal organization in the United States dedicated to originalism, and the Heritage Foundation, one of the premiere conservative think tanks in America, to develop a list from which he would choose Scalia’s successor.  That list was a who’s-who of conservative legal leaders in the country, all but one of them a sitting judge. Critics said it was too good to be true, and latched onto every word of Trump’s off-the-cuff speaking style to parse each sentence, concluding that he left himself wiggle room to deviate from that list if he won. They insisted he would bargain away Scalia’s seat for a moderate, “consensus” candidate (there is no such thing these days) in exchange for some legislative accomplishment.  Trump pounded away on the issue of the courts right up to Election Day. Never before in American politics has the Supreme Court—and all other federal courts under it—been such a central issue in a race for the White House.  Then on November 8, 2016, Trump was elected the 45th president of the United States. Polling data showed that for 21 percent of voters, the Supreme Court was the #1 issue that determined their vote. Those voters went for Trump 57 percent to 41 percent, a potent plus-16-point issue for the Republican nominee, helping to propel the business mogul to the White House.  As head of state, President Trump has blown the doors off the hinges when it comes to judicial nominees. He successfully appointed Justice Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, a spectacularly well-credentialed legal genius who may actually be slightly to the right of the beloved Justice Scalia, more in the mold of Justice Clarence Thomas.  But President Trump has not stopped there. Instead, his White House counsel and Department of Justice has continued to consult with experts from the Federalist Society and Heritage Foundation to identify committed originalists for every seat on the 13 U.S. courts of appeals. They have also insisted on rigorous screening for the seats on the 94 U.S. district courts, consulting home-state senators, but insisting on conservative credentials.  Although Democrats have tried unprecedented tactics to delay or derail these judicial nominees, the Senate has recently broken the logjam, taking the number of confirmed nominees from 7 to 13 in just one week, and promising to get all the appellate nominees on the bench by the end of 2017.  President Trump’s base is demanding that they hurry up, abolish the remaining obstacles impeding those judges, and confirm every one of the president’s picks.  Expecting at least two more Supreme Court picks during his first term, President Trump has pledged to adhere to his list going forward for additional vacancies on the High Court. It is possible he could also update the list to add one or more of the newly minted conservative legal home-runs to that list; Republicans would likely trust the president and his team—both inside the administration and outside—to use the same care they have used thus far to continue identifying jurists in the mold of Justices Scalia, Thomas, and Gorsuch.  The judges issue has proven to be one of the greatest political assets for President Trump. There is no issue the GOP base is more passionate about, and polls consistently show that moderate voters prefer judges who adhere to the Constitution and law as written, and leave policy judgments and political considerations to elected politicians. This issue favors Republicans when properly articulated.  President Trump also understands this is an instant legacy for him, recently commenting that some of the judges he is appointing now could still be on the bench 40 years from now, shaping the law for decades to come.  One year after President Trump’s historic election, the 21 percent who voted on the federal courts got exactly what they were promised.  Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for  News.

Vice President Mike Pence offers a list of President Trump’s accomplishments since he won the election, only one year ago today:  Thanks to the president’s leadership, the American economy is roaring. Businesses have created nearly 1.5 million new jobs. Manufacturers haven’t been this confident in 20 years. The stock market is setting records, creating nearly $5 trillion in wealth for the pension, retirement and savings of the American people. And after eight years of lackluster growth, the economy has already expanded by at least 3% for two quarters in a row.  The U.S. economy is making a comeback because President Trump has taken decisive action to spur a new era of opportunity, prosperity and growth.  We’ve unleashed American energy, approved the Keystone and Dakota pipelines, and under President Trump, the “war on coal” is over.  We’re appointing originalists to the federal courts, to uphold the Constitution and all our God-given liberties. And President Trump put Justice Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court.  President Trump has also taken decisive action to ensure the safety and security of the American people, at home and abroad. He has stood without apology with the men and women of law enforcement. We’re securing our borders, enforcing our laws and taking the gang members, drug dealers and violent criminals off our streets.  The president is putting our veterans first. He signed bills to restore accountability to the Department of Veterans Affairs and give veterans access to the world-class care they deserve.  We’re rebuilding our military. President Trump has already signed the largest increase in defense spending in nearly 10 years, and we are working with Congress to pass one of the largest investments in the national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan.  With renewed American strength, the president is achieving real results on the international stage.  Our NATO allies are contributing more to our common defense. ISIS is on the run, and its caliphate is crumbling. This president reaffirmed the credibility of American power when he enforced a red line against chemical weapons in Syria. He put Iran on notice and made it clear that we cannot certify the Iran nuclear deal. And our administration has brought unprecedented economic and diplomatic pressure to bear on North Korea.  It has been a year of accomplishments, and we’re just getting started. Before this year is out, we’ll pass historic tax cuts for the American people.

3235,Rohit,,12,31,2099,"Bannon: Elites Can No Longer Tell Working Class ‘What’s Right, What’s Wrong’","Former White House chief strategist and  News executive chairman Steven K. Bannon declared at a Macomb County, Michigan GOP Unity dinner on Wednesday that President Donald Trump won Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania because Trump understood the plight of the American Midwest and the middle-class.  Bannon told the Macomb County Republican audience that then-candidate Donald Trump was the finest candidate since Ronald Reagan and that Trump understood how globalism hollowed out America’s manufacturing base in the Midwest. Bannon said:  Let’s go back let’s go back in time in August 85 days before, Donald J. Trump, when I joined the campaign I think was August 13th or 14th. I think it was 12 – 16 points down basically double digits down at every battleground state. For every significant battleground state, I think was 70 on the generic ballot you got to be 99 of every 10 registered Republicans have to vote for you to be President I states. I think was like at 70, campaign didn’t have a lot of cash, not a lot of organization, but what we had was I thought the finest candidate to run for the presidency since Ronald Reagan. And just like Ronald Reagan he understood at a very deep level the problems of this country; he understood why Macomb County and certain areas of Michigan have gone from a global powerhouse in manufacturing to hollowed out. Donald Trump understood what globalization and the elites in this country—in other countries had done to working men and women in the United States and so all I told him I said look it’s very simple we’re just going to compare and contrast Hillary Clinton, who is the Guardian or the standard bearer the Tribune of a corrupt and incompetent elite with yourself who’s an agent of change.  President Donald Trump swept the 2016 presidential election winning 304 electoral votes to Hillary Clinton’s 227 votes by winning Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.  By contrast, Bannon argued that Hillary stood for the status quo in America, which continues to destroy the country’s economy, culture, and military. Bannon explained:  I told candidate Trump at the time on that Saturday and then again on Sunday the 13th to the 14th he had 100% certitude to win if he just stuck with the playbook and that playbook was basically give people permission to vote for you as an agent of change. I said Hillary Clinton stands for exactly the way things are and folks in this country understand that the country is being destroyed economically, culturally, militarily and things can’t go on like this.  The former White House chief strategist suggested that Trump’s simple message of ending mass illegal immigration, curbing legal immigration, bringing back manufacturing jobs, and focusing on an America First foreign policy resonated with America’s working class.  Bannon said, “Now how did Donald Trump do that? He had just gotten very focused on what the message was of a handful of things, number one stop mass illegal immigration and start to deal with legal immigration to get our sovereignty back. Number two, bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States. And number three, we have to bring an end to these pointless foreign wars.”  Bannon added, “People in this country are worried about their children and their grandchildren. They’re worried about where the factories went, who sent them there, and who made money off sending them there? They want to get focused on the problems in this country, not makeup problems.”  Bannon suggested that during the 2016 presidential campaign, they could see Donald Trump’s nationalist-populist rhetoric reaching America’s middle class across Pennsylvania and Michigan. The  News executive chairman then said that Trump connects with the average American in a way that Hillary could not.  Bannon contended:  We could look at the demographics and we look at what was happening around places like Youngstown, Ohio in Dubuque, Iowa. Our plan was, if we could see it coming back to us, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota and we could feel it coming back to us, we could feel it coming back to us. No president could have put that no candidate could have put that that group of states together and here’s the reason he speaks not just in a vernacular and connects to people he talks to folks like an adult about the most important issues of the day because he’s not a politician. It’s the reason I wanted to come here tonight, to have a partner’s conversation with y’all about exactly where we stand. The only time I ever doubted was that on Election Day we finished in fact we finished in in Michigan, right? I’m not even sure Hillary Clinton—I think she went to Detroit one time I’m not sure.  Bannon concluded, “For too long we’ve allowed the geniuses on Wall Street, in Silicon Valley, in Washington, D.C. to dictate to the working men and women in this country, what’s right and what’s wrong, what’s good and what’s bad, and we’ve had now over 40 years of an ascending economy with technology in Silicon Valley, in Wall Street, in Hollywood, in the imperial capital of Washington, D.C. In Washington, D.C. seven of the nine counties that surround it are the richest counties in this country.”",http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/11/09/bannon-elites-can-no-longer-tell-working-class-whats-right-whats-wrong/

3265,Rohit,,12,31,2099,"China to ease curbs on foreign business in finance, autos","U.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping attend at a state dinner at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China, Thursday, Nov. 9, 2017. (Thomas Peter/Pool Photo via AP)  BEIJING (AP) — China took what it called a major step toward opening its financial industry with a promise Friday to ease limits on foreign ownership of banks and securities firms following a visit by U.S. President Donald Trump that was dominated by trade issues.  The announcement by a Cabinet official appeared to respond to mounting U.S. and European complaints that Beijing hampers foreign activity in a variety of industries in violation of free-trade commitments. The American Chamber of Commerce in China, which has appealed to Beijing to ease market barriers, said it looked forward to seeing details of the latest changes.  The announcement followed a series of multibillion-dollar contract signings with American companies during Trump’s visit in a tradition aimed at blunting criticism of Beijing’s trade surpluses and market barriers.  China will lift its limit on foreign ownership of securities, fund management and futures companies from a minority stake of 49 percent to a majority stake of 51 percent and end restrictions after three years, the official, Zhu Guangyao, said at a news briefing. He said a similar change would be made for life insurance companies and those would end in five years.  Regulators also will abolish restrictions that limit a single foreign investor’s stake in a Chinese bank to 20 percent and cap total foreign ownership of any institution at 25 percent, Zhu said.  “In other words, foreign owners can have full ownership of such companies” after three to five years, he said. “This opening up is decisive and the effect will be far-reaching.”  Beijing will also gradually reduce tariffs on automotive imports, Zhu said, without providing details.  The announcement came hours after Trump left Beijing to attend an Asia-Pacific economic meeting in Danang, Vietnam.  Asked about the timing of the changes announced Friday, Zhu cited President Xi Jinping’s comments at the ruling Communist Party’s twice-a-decade congress last month. Xi promised freer markets but also emphasized that Beijing wants to build up state-owned companies that dominate finance, energy and other industries.  American, European and other foreign companies complain that despite official pledges to open China’s economy, they are hampered by ownership limits and other restrictions in finance, health care and other promising industries.  “I look forward to seeing the details, as opening up the financial sector in particular could greatly improve the allocation of financial resources and support China’s future development,” William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber, said in an email. “These restrictions, and many others yet to be addressed, have been hindering economic activity in China for far too long.”  Ahead of Trump’s visit, the American Chamber had expressed concern that his focus on trade in goods might mean he paid less attention to complaints about restrictions on access to finance, health care and other industries in China’s state-dominated economy.  Trump has made narrowing the U.S. trade deficit with China — $347 billion last year — a priority. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that was a “central focus” of Trump’s talks with Xi.  Xi promised Thursday to open China’s state-dominated economy wider, but foreign companies have been disappointed when previous pledges of liberalization turned out to include restrictions that limited their impact.  For its part, Zhu said Beijing wants Washington to ease security-related export controls on high-tech goods and take action on what Beijing says is a promise to grant the country market-economy status.  China has pressed the United States for years to end controls on “dual use” technologies with both civilian and military uses such as supercomputers and advanced materials that can be used in warplanes and missiles.  Beijing says Washington and other governments agreed to grant market-economy status last year as part of China’s 2001 accession to the World Trade Organization. That would make it harder for them to bring anti-dumping and other cases against China.  The United States, the European Union, Japan and other governments reject China’s assertion and say Beijing has yet to follow through on liberalization required to qualify.  This week’s contract signings give Trump the opportunity to claim a rare political win following a first year in office marked by little legislative progress on health care and taxes.  Commerce Minister Zhong Shan said agreements signed Thursday at a ceremony attended by Trump and Xi totaled $253.4 billion, though many were memoranda of understanding or other arrangements that were less than firm contracts. Commercial sales announced appeared to total about $65 billion, many involving goods Chinese companies routinely buy.  That was on top of $9 billion in contracts signed by the two sides on Wednesday covering sales of soybeans, pork, beef and other goods.  Such contract signings are a fixture of visits to Beijing by foreign leaders and are meant to defuse trade complaints. They often represent purchases already made by Chinese mobile phone makers, airlines and other customers that are collected for the visit, which means they have little effect on the trade balance.","https://www.apnews.com//bf056cc0831f46e5bfdefb56b34bb7de/China-to-ease-curbs-on-foreign-business-in-finance,-autos"
3297,Rohit,,12,31,2099,"Starting Monday, calorie counts on menus are going to be mandatory","It’s finally happening. After nearly a decade of delays, Trump’s Food and Drug Administration is implementing an Obama-era policy on Monday that will require restaurants and other food outlets with 20 or more locations to post calorie counts.  Any big chain — from grocery stores to movie theaters, amusement parks to vending machines to restaurants — will have to show how many calories come with their sandwiches, popcorn, cocktails, beer, wine, and french fries. Up front. Right on the menus.  In some eateries, menu labeling is already happening. Several major chains started to move in this direction voluntarily because the FDA was expected to finalize this regulation years ago. It’s why you can see that the grande latte at Starbucks has 190 calories, the turkey, apple, and cheddar sandwich at Panera has 710 calories, and McDonald’s Big Mac packs 530 calories, for example.  But we’ll now be flooded with calorie data. And while these changes aren’t expected to cause Americans to suddenly clean up their diets, they could have profound indirect effects on how we think about food and nutrition, what we choose from the menu, and ultimately what restaurants serve.  We now get most of our calories from eating out — but it’s been hard to count those calories  Americans do a lot of their eating outside of the home these days. More than half of the money spent on food goes to restaurants and convenient on-the-go meals — not to groceries cooked at home.  Make no mistake: When we dine out, we eat more. People typically consume 20 to 40 percent more calories in restaurants compared with what they’d eat at home.  As Tuft University researchers found, in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, restaurant dishes at non-chain establishments across the country typically contained 1,200 calories — about half of the 2,000 or 2,500 calories recommended for moderately active women and men in an entire day. For these reasons, the American propensity to dine out has been linked with the obesity epidemic.  For a long time, consumers were left to operate blindly when it came to how many calories they were consuming when dining out. Unlike the nutrition facts panels that come with preprepared foods we eat at home, there was no such transparency around restaurant food.  Then along came the Affordable Care Act in 2010. Buried among its many provisions were rules requiring ""retail food establishments"" with 20 or more locations to post ""on the menu listing the item for sale, the number of calories contained in the standard menu item,” as ’s Sarah Kliff reported. Another section in the law mandated vending machines ""provide a sign in close proximity to each article of food or the selection button that includes a clear and conspicuous statement disclosing the number of calories contained in the article.""  The hope was that these regulations would help people calculate how many calories they were eating, and maybe have an impact on obesity.  “Big Pizza” and other food lobby groups tried to fight menu labeling. Then the FDA’s commissioner said he’d get the job done.  The Food and Drug Administration, one of the agencies that regulates the food industry, was in charge of finalizing and implementing menu labeling. But the Obamacare mandates, even under President Barack Obama, were beset by delays because of intense lobbying from various factions of the food industry.  American pizza makers have pushed for, among other things, only posting calories for serving sizes they determine, instead of the actual serving sizes people are going to eat. Convenience stores and supermarkets argued menu labeling, while appropriate for restaurants, would be too expensive and burdensome for them. Movie theaters, for their part, tried to keep their 1,000-calorie popcorns out of the calorie postings.  Finally, in November 2017, the FDA released draft guidance about how the industry would have to comply with the menu labeling by May 2018. Health advocates said they were pleased to see the rule was left mostly intact, which came as a surprise since the Trump administration had pushed back the implementation of the rule just before it was supposed to go into effect a year ago, last May.  The FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has repeatedly pledged his personal interest in nutrition, and his desire to go ahead with menu labeling, which he doesn’t view as a left or right issue, as Politico’s Helena Bottemiller Evich reported. “I’m quite sure that a lot of conservatives, including myself, have turned over packages in stores to look at the calorie information and the nutrition information and appreciate that that information is there,” he told Politico.  For that reason, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which had sued the FDA over menu labeling delays, put their lawsuit on hold in September.  And Gottlieb kept his word. In a May 2 blog post, he framed the regulation as a win for consumers and a way to enhance competition among food producers to create products that are “healthy, inexpensive ... [and] also tasteful.”  “I’ve working on menu labeling for 15 years, and am thrilled that at long last, people will be able make up their own mind about how many calories they want to eat at chain restaurants,” said Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. “Menu labeling allows people an easy way to cut hundreds of calories or more with simple, split-second decisions.”  The law could have a far-reaching impact, and not just on the food choices individuals make  To date, the evidence on calorie labeling’s impact on health is somewhat mixed. The studies and meta-analyses either suggest that calorie labeling has had little influence over people's food choices or that the available studies are too poorly designed to really tell. A newer Cochrane Review also concluded that the quality of the available evidence is low — leading to uncertainty about menu labeling’s effects — but noted that studies carried out in real-world settings suggest labeling could reduce calorie intake by about 50 calories per meal (or 8 percent of a 600 calorie meal).  Researchers have also found that people who are already calorie-conscious do pay attention to labels, but those who aren't don't. In other words, just having that information displayed doesn't intrinsically change people's behaviors. So health wonks don’t expect most people will immediately start making healthier food choices when menu labels come out.  There’s also the question of whether menu labels are accurate: one study investigated and found that posted calorie counts generally hit the mark, but there was some variation. Nearly 20 percent of foods tested had 100 more calories per serving than the labels stated.  Even so, calorie labeling’s biggest impacts are expected to have little to do with the one-off choices we make at the ordering counter: they could push food companies and restaurants to reformulate products so that they aren’t so hideously high in calories, and shift consumer attitudes about nutrition.  Researchers have found that after menu labeling was implemented in Seattle in 2009, food purveyors tweaked their recipes and lowered calories, for example.  Menu labeling also prompts people to talk about calories — raising awareness about nutrition, as this Health Affairs study pointed out:  For example, a recent article in the New York Times showed that the typical order at Chipotle contains about 1,070 calories—twice as many calories as a Big Mac and “more than half of the calories that most adults are supposed to eat in an entire day.”  Harvard Medical School researcher Jason Block, who has been studying calorie labeling, draws a comparison to how smoking behaviors have evolved over time. “The story about tobacco policies and how smoking patterns have changed is as much a story about changing social norms as it is about specific policies. This widespread implementation of a public education campaign like calorie labeling should change the public’s consciousness about calories.”  We know from the soda tax debate that it’s been hard to disentangle what impact the taxes are having from the awareness the tax debate raised about the health impact of soda.

At a news conference in Hanoi, Vietnam, as he continues his 13-day Asia trip, Trump also said that he thinks Russian President Vladimir Putin believes it when he says Moscow did not interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  But Trump made clear that he sides with U.S. intelligence agencies, which have concluded that Russia did meddle in the election.  “I believe that he feels that he and Russia did not meddle in the election,” Trump said of Putin at the joint news conference with Vietnam's President Tran Dai Quang.  “As to whether I believe it, I'm with our agencies,” the president added. “As currently led by fine people, I believe very much in our intelligence agencies.”  ""As to whether I believe it, I'm with our agencies. As currently led by fine people, I believe very much in our intelligence agencies.” — President Donald Trump  The U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Russia interfered in the election to help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton.  Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Saturday, Trump had said that Putin again vehemently denied the allegations -- this time during an economic summit in Vietnam. Trump said he believed “that when he tells me that, he means it.”  Trump had also dismissed former U.S. intelligence officials as “political hacks” and accused Democrats of using the issue to try to sabotage relations between the two countries, putting lives at risk.  But Trump’s Saturday comments drew sharp criticism in the United States, with U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and others asserting that the president seemed to side with Putin over U.S. intelligence professionals, Politico reported.  At the news conference, Trump reiterated his view that it's crucial for the U.S. to get along with Russia, and seemed to suggest that it was time to remove the sanctions Congress has slapped on Russia in retaliation for its election meddling efforts.  “It's now time to get back to healing a world that is shattered and broken,"" said Trump. ""Those are very important things.”  As he traveled to Hanoi, the second-to-last stop of his Asia trip, Trump told reporters that Putin ""said he absolutely did not meddle in our election. He did not do what they are saying he did.""  “Every time he sees me, he said: `I didn't do that.' And I believe -- I really believe -- that when he tells me that, he means it,"" Trump said, calling the accusation an ""artificial barrier"" erected by Democrats.  The president lashed out at the former heads of the nation's intelligence community, and said there were plenty of reasons to be suspicious of their findings.  “I mean, give me a break. They're political hacks,"" Trump said, citing by name James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence, John Brennan, the former CIA director and his ousted ex-FBI director James Comey, whom Trump said was ""proven now to be a liar and he's proven to be a leaker.”  In a tweet sent Sunday from Hanoi, Trump bashed the ""haters and fools"" he said are questioning his efforts to improve relations with Russia and accused critics of ""playing politics"" and hurting the country.  Trump's comments about Putin and ""political hacks"" brought criticism from lawmakers with ties to the intelligence community.  U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who is his party's top member on the House's intelligence committee, said in a statement that Trump ""fools no one"" and that the president understands how the Russians intervened through hacking, social media and their own television coverage of the presidential race.  McCain, the GOP’s presidential nominee in 2008, said in a statement that Trump's faith in Putin's denial was ""naive.""  ""There's nothing ‘America First' about taking the word of a KGB colonel over that of the American intelligence community,"" McCain wrote, referring to Putin's former career in Soviet intelligence. ""Vladimir Putin does not have America's interests at heart.""  Trump was in Hanoi for a brief state visit, including Sunday's meeting with Quang at the presidential palace.  In brief remarks after his arrival, Trump offered help negotiating with China on disputes over the South China Sea. Beijing's island-building there has drawn criticism from Washington, which argues the U.S. has a national interest in freedom of navigation in sea lanes critical for world trade. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson earlier this month said China's ""provocative actions"" challenged international law and norms.  “If I can help mediate or arbitrate, please let me know,"" Trump offered. ""I'm a very good mediator and a very good arbitrator. I've done plenty of it from both sides.""

3331,Rohit,,12,31,2099,HA! ALABAMA LAWMAKER Tells MSNBC's Chuck Todd Democrats Practice 'Gutter Politics'  ,"Liberals on twitter were outraged when a Republican lawmaker from Alabama told the truth about what’s going on with the character assassination attempt on Senate candidate Roy Moore…Aren’t people innocent until proven guilty? Please see our report below on the Roy Moore accuser.  Perry Hooper, Jr: Roy Moore has been in the public eye and public office for the last 30 some-odd-years. And now these ladies are just now coming forward with these type of accusations and allegations? I just think it’s typical Democrat gutter politics.  A Roy Moore supporter just straight up lied to @chucktodd about the sexual harassment accusations against Trump being found to be ""all false"" and Todd completely let him get away with it Do better pic.twitter.com/PVJwjGYbVU      *    Email *  Email     — Andrew Lawrence (@ndrew_lawrence) November 10, 2017    OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THE TRUTH ABOUT THE ROY MOORE CHARACTER ASSASSINATION BY THE LEFT:  Infowars uncovered a bombshell when they discovered the Facebook page of one of Judge Roy Moore’s accusers, Debbie Gibson, who came out in a Washington Post article to accuse him of sexual misconduct that allegedly took place 36 years ago.  Debbie Wesson Gibson says that she was 17 in the spring of 1981 when Moore spoke to her Etowah High School civics class about serving as the assistant district attorney. She says that when he asked her out, she asked her mother what she would say if she wanted to date a 34-year-old man. Gibson says her mother asked her who the man was, and when Gibson said “Roy Moore,” her mother said, “I’d say you were the luckiest girl in the world.” Among locals in Gadsden, a town of about 47,000 back then, Moore “had this godlike, almost deity status — he was a hometown boy made good,” Gibson says, “West Point and so forth.” Gibson says that they dated for two to three months, and that he took her to his house, read her poetry and played his guitar. She says he kissed her once in his bedroom and once by the pool at a local country club. “Looking back, I’m glad nothing bad happened,” says Gibson, who now lives in Florida. “As a mother of daughters, I realize that our age difference at that time made our dating inappropriate.” Debbie Gibson hates Donald Trump, but that’s not all, she’s pretty fond of Judge Roy Moore’s opponent, Doug Ross for US Senate In Alabama as well…  Here are a few anti-Trump posts that were found on Gibson’s Facebook page:  One of senatorial candidate Roy Moore’s accusers is apparently a fervent Democrat who has worked for the DNC as a sign language interpreter for Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden, a revelation which the Washington Post never included in its original report.  The accuser, Debbie Gibson, had also publically supported Moore’s opponent Doug Jones before the accusations came to light.  Gibson openly bragged about signing for Hillary during a campaign appearance. On a side note, we’re not sure who she’s signing for. The crowd behind Hillary, that is usually packed with the Democrats hand-picked “diverse” crowd, appears to be pretty thin.  Here’s a post from Gibson’s page proving that she’s supporting Judge Roy Moore’s Democrat opponent for US Senate:  She even posted a video of Moore’s opponent, Doug Jones to promote him to her friends on Facebook. The screenshot below shows the post on her page.  Interestingly, when attacking Moore ally Steve Bannon for suggesting the Washington Post was politically motivated in its reporting, the newspaper implied that Gibson wasn’t “down with Democratic propaganda,” a statement which seemingly conflicts with Gibson’s political activism:  That’s not what the photos say…  The Washington Post reported:  “According to campaign reports, none of the women has donated to or worked for Moore’s Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, or his rivals in the Republican primary…”  But notice the precise wording; it’s lawyer-speak. It might very well be true that Gibson didn’t donate or work for Doug Jones, but according to her Facebook profile, she did actively campaign for him, which doesn’t help her credibility and it should have been reported – yet the Washington Post conveniently left it out.",https://100percentfedup.com/ha-alabama-lawmaker-tells-msnbcs-chuck-todd-democrats-practice-gutter-politics-video/
3348,Rohit,,12,31,2099,"Ever wake up to a numb, dead arm? Here’s what’s happening.","Waking up in the middle of the night to discover one of your arms has lost all feeling is frightening.  At first, the limb is limp and flops around like a useless bag of bone before coming back to life with a flood of ""pins and needles"" sensations.  When this happened to me as a kid, I panicked, thinking I'd done something horrible to my body, anxious that I'd never be able to move my arm again. But the feeling in my arm always came back.  This phenomenon is really common, says James Dyck, a neurology researcher with the Mayo Clinic. And it's actually a cool example of how the body can protect itself even during the paralysis of sleep.  Dyck explained there's a common misconception that pins and needles and numbness are caused by a lack of blood flow to the nerves. ""The more likely thing is nerve compression — nerves are being pushed on and squashed, and that causes these symptoms,"" he says.  You have several nerves in your arm. Each serves a vital function.  The axillary nerve lifts the arm at the shoulder.  The musculocutaneous nerve bends the elbow.  The radial nerve straightens out the arm and lifts your wrist and fingers.  The ulnar nerve spreads your fingers.  Although Dyck says the exact physiology isn't completely understood, the effect of compressing any of these nerves in sleep — when you sleep on top of your arm or pin it underneath a partner — is like stepping on a garden hose. The information that flows from your extremities back to your brain is temporarily disrupted.  So why does it feel paralyzed upon waking?  Dyck suggests two reasons.  1) It is actually, temporarily, paralyzed. During REM sleep, the brain sends a signal to cause a body-wide paralysis. The purpose of this is to keep you from acting out dreams (which occur during REM). But if you wake up during one of these phases, you can be conscious before your fully regain control of your limbs. This is called sleep paralysis, and it can be a frightening situation. You're stuck somewhere in between dreaming and wakefulness, and you can't move.  2) The nerve compression has led to a temporary paralysis (perhaps because you got stuck in a compressed position during REM).  Compressing nerves can damage them. The good thing is that the body will naturally wake up as a protection mechanism when a nerve has been compressed too long. After you wake and relieve the pressure, the nerves will quickly come back online, usually first with a pins-and-needles feeling.  ""The nerve structures, as they recover, tend to be irritable for a period of time,"" the University of Rochester Medical Center explains. ""That’s because the nerves are firing spontaneously. Most of the time, the feeling of pins and needles is a good sign. It is a temporary phase that means nerves are coming back to life.""  Someone who falls asleep on a limb is unlikely to do major damage to the nerves, Dyck says. But there are some cases when compressed nerves can become a greater problem.  One such case is called ""Saturday night palsy,"" when a person falls asleep compressing a nerve while drunk. The alcohol impairs your body's ability to wake you up and protect your nerves.  ""If you’re passed out drunk, you won’t move your arm,"" Dyck says. And when you wake up the next day, you can't extend your wrist and you can’t extend your fingers."" That might last longer than a few moments (perhaps even a few days or months) as the nerve has to repair its protective coating.  And then there's hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP), a genetic condition that makes people more susceptible to nerve compression injuries. They might want to be extra careful not to fall asleep on a limb or even cross their leg to avoid nerve compression. (Carpal tunnel may also cause tingling or numbness in limbs at night.)  Again, for most people who wake up to a dead limb, it's just a temporary annoyance. And it ""probably takes less time [to recover] than you think it does, because you’re freaking out about it,"" Dyck says.  Late sleeper? Blame your genes.",https://www.vox.com/2016/6/6/11854588/numb-arm-sleep
3359,Rohit,,12,31,2099,TWO NEW POLLS Offer BAD NEWS For Democrats….Why Washington Post’s HIT JOB On Roy Moore May Have Backfired ,"Last week, the Washington Post reported that after almost 4 decades, 4 women came forward to claim they were sexually abused as teenagers, by Roy Moore, the GOP candidate for senator in Alabama. Nevermind that for 4 decades they were silent about Moore’s alleged behavior, and that only 4 weeks before the election, they all decided to confide in the leftist rag who just endorsed Moore’s Democrat opponent, Doug Ross for Senate.    It was discovered last week that one of the women who accused Roy Moore of sexual misconduct actually worked for Hillary as a “signer” at her campaign, openly trashed President Trump and pushed her friends to support Moore’s opponent on her personal Facebook page.        *    Email *  Email      Meanwhile, the allegations against Moore continue to unravel, as the mother of Leigh Corfman, who says that Alabama Senatorial Candidate Roy Moore tried to engage in a sexual encounter with her when she was 14, told Breitbart News that the Washington Post worked to convince her daughter to give an interview about the allegations against Moore.  Speaking by phone to Breitbart News on Saturday, Corfman’s mother, Nancy Wells, 71, further stated that her daughter would not have come forward if it weren’t for The Post reporter’s alleged actions.  Earlier on Sunday, Breitbart News reported that Corfman’s mother contradicted a key detail of Corfman’s story. Speaking by phone to Breitbart News on Saturday, Wells said that her daughter did not have a phone in her bedroom during the period that Moore is reported to have allegedly called Corfman – purportedly on Corfman’s bedroom phone – to arrange at least one encounter.  The Washington Post cited Corfman as remembering that she provided Moore with her number when she was 14. She said that she spoke to Moore from what she described as the phone in her bedroom.  Today, the left got some very bad new about their hit job on Roy Moore…it appears that polls show Alabama voters aren’t buying it…  Breitbart News – Two new polls demonstrate that GOP nominee for the U.S. Senate Judge Roy Moore remains unaffected entirely by smears in the Washington Post against him, and his lead before the Post piece on Thursday afternoon remains intact.  One of the polls, which were both provided by the pollster to Breitbart News exclusively on Saturday evening, was conducted on Thursday morning before the publication of the Post piece that afternoon. The second one was conducted on Saturday evening. Together, they show Judge Moore’s lead over Democrat Doug Jones has been virtually unaffected since the Post story came out.  The first survey, which was conducted entirely before noon local time on Thursday, shows Moore leading Jones by 50 percent to 39.2 percent with 10.8 percent undecided. That survey of 1,354 likely voters in the upcoming Dec. 12 special election has a margin of error of 3.5 percent.  The second survey, conducted Saturday evening—two days after the Post piece hit, roiling Alabama’s political scene—shows Moore and Jones with about the exact same percentages as before. Moore’s position in this second poll is 49.8 percent—meaning he only dropped 0.2 percent since the story hit—and Jones has only picked up 0.4 percent to reach 39.6 percent total. The second survey, which polled 1,536 likely voters with a margin of error of 3.3 percent, has 10.5 percent as undecided.  “The polling between Thursday morning and Saturday showed far less movement than I originally expected,” pollster John Wahl told Breitbart News. “The controversy surrounding the Washington Post article seems to have galvanized the support of both candidates, but not changed the actual percentages in a significant manner. The Moore campaign has already weathered a considerable amount of political attacks during this campaign season, and I expect most of his lightest support to have blown off during these attacks. His current support level is holding fairly steady.”  Another liberal publication, The Hill, reported that Moore was losing in the polls to Jones after the hit piece on Moore was published in the Washington Post.  The Hill -Democrat Doug Jones is leading Republican Roy Moore in Alabama’s Senate race in the wake of explosive accusations of sexual misconduct against Moore, according to a new poll released Sunday.  Forty-six percent of likely voters polled said they would vote for Jones, while 42 percent said they would vote for Moore, according to the Louisiana-based JMC Analytics and Polling.  The survey was conducted on Nov. 9 and Nov. 11, after The Washington Post reported that a woman said Moore had initiated a sexual encounter with her in 1979, when she was 14 years old and he was 32.  The RealClearPolitics poll has Moore and Jones tied.  The poll showing Moore losing to Jones was conducted by JMP, the same polling operation who gave us this hilariously inaccurate poll, only one week before the general election in 2016:  We’re gonna go out on a limb, and say that this so-called scandal involving Judge Roy Moore is going to backfire spectacularly on the left, and will ultimately only shine a spotlight on the hypocrisy of the Democrat Party, who ignored the sexual misconduct of former President Bill Clinton and his enabling wife, Hillary Clinton for decades.",https://100percentfedup.com/lol-two-new-polls-offer-bad-news-democrats-washington-posts-hit-job-roy-moore-may-backfired/
3364,Rohit,,12,31,2099,REPUBLICAN LEADER Implies He May Not Seat Roy Moore If He Wins Election ,"The New York Times just confirmed what we’ve all known since Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell threw his support to Luther Strange in the Alabama primary…The GOP will do anything it can to stop Judge Moore from becoming a US Senator. A report at the New York Times indicates that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., may not seat Moore even if he wins the election. Moreover, Republican elites are trying to get the election pushed back. The Republicans have pulled funds from Judge Moore even though there is no proof he’s guilty of these charges. It’s an obvious sandbagging of a candidate the Republican swamp creatures and Democrats don’t like.  According to the New York Times:    Republican senators and their advisers, in a flurry of phone calls, emails and text messages, discussed fielding a write-in candidate, pushing Alabama’s governor to delay the Dec. 12 special election or even not seating Mr. Moore at all should he be elected. In an interview, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, declined to say whether he would agree to seat Mr. Moore should he win. Mr. McConnell deferred a question about a possible write-in campaign by Senator Luther Strange, the current occupant of the seat, to Mr. Strange.        *    Email *  Name      The establishment is losing control so they’re taking drastic measures to get it back…The scandal facing candidate Roy Moore is the biggest hit job since the fake Russian “Golden Showers” Dossier the DNC and media pushed out to try and destroy Trump. You have to really question Republican leadership when they go to these lengths to harm a candidate. Judge Moore has been in public service for decades but we’re just now hearing about the issue with a 14-year old when he was 32? C’mon now…This smells to high heaven of a smear job.  Remember that the swamp creatures in the Republican Party detest Trump because he’s not beholden to the Chamber of Commerce’s wish for illegal cheap labor. The bottom line is these politicians aren’t putting Americans first.
